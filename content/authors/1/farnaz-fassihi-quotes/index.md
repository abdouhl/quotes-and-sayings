quotes = ['''The first time I went to Iraq was October 2002, when Saddam was still in power, and then, subsequently, in January of 2003, about three-and-a-half months before the U.S. invasion. So, I got to see the before and after of Iraq, basically, before and after the war.''' ,'''I had several near death experiences or very, you know, close calls, if you may, in Iraq.
