quotes = ['''My mission is not to forbid French art. If the quality is there, I buy; if the quality isn't there, I don't.''' ,'''I have no sense of nostalgia. Tomorrow is what interests me.''' ,'''The passion for art is, as for believers, very religious. It unites people, its message is of common humanity. Art has become my religion - others pray in church. It's a banality, but you don't possess art, it possesses you. It's like falling in love.''' ,'''The Italians live well. They have problems, like all countries, but they are well-dressed, the women are pretty.''' ,]
