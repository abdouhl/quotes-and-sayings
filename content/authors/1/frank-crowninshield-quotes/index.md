quotes = ['''I have never collected an object or figure from Africa or Oceania because of anything curious about it or because of its utility or historic interest. Everything has been chosen entirely because of its aesthetic significance; its form, feeling, structure, and plastic values.''' ,'''Young men and young women, full of courage, originality, and genius, are everywhere to be met with.''' ,'''For women, we intend to do something in a noble and missionary spirit... We mean to appeal to their intellects... and we hereby announce ourselves as determined and bigoted feminists.''' ,'''What Marie Antoinette was to eighteenth-century France, Mary Pickford is to twentieth-century America.''' ,'''My interest in society - at times so pronounced that the word 'snob' comes a little to mind - derives from the fact that I like an immense number of things which society, money, and position bring in their train: painting, tapestries, rare books, smart dresses, dances, gardens, country houses, correct cuisine, and pretty women.''' ,'''My sense of loneliness was not particularly great until I reached sixty.

Today the boy calls up, says, 'Meet you at the back door of Stern's.'''' ,'''Let us instance one respect in which American life has recently undergone a great change. We allude to its increased devotion to pleasure, to happiness, to dancing, to sport... to the delights of the country, to laughter, and to all forms of cheerfulness.''' ,]
