We have made hardly any changes in our conception of university organization, education, graduation, for a century - for several centuries.''' ,'''There's nothing wrong in suffering, if you suffer for a purpose. Our revolution didn't abolish danger or death. It simply made danger and death worthwhile.''' ,'''In politics, strangely enough, the best way to play your cards is to lay them face upwards on the table.''' ,'''It is not reasonable that those who gamble with men's lives should not pay with their own.''' ,'''The past is the beginning of the beginning and all that is and has been is but the twilight of the dawn.''' ,'''Human history in essence is the history of ideas.''' ,'''The past is but the past of a beginning.''' ,'''Moral indignation is jealousy with a halo.''' ,'''If we don't end war, war will end us.''' ,'''Human history becomes more and more a race between education and catastrophe.''' ,'''Every time I see an adult on a bicycle, I no longer despair for the future of the human race.''' ,'''What really matters is what you do with what you have.''' ,'''Once the command of the air is obtained by one of the contending armies, the war becomes a conflict between a seeing host and one that is blind.''' ,'''The path of least resistance is the path of the loser.''' ,'''History is a race between education and catastrophe.''' ,'''After people have repeated a phrase a great number of times, they begin to realize it has meaning and may even be true.''' ,'''The path of social advancement is, and must be, strewn with broken friendships.''' ,'''I had rather be called a journalist than an artist.''' ,'''Heresies are experiments in man's unsatisfied search for truth.''' ,'''Beauty is in the heart of the beholder.''' ,'''The only true measure of success is the ratio between what we might have done and what we might have been on the one hand, and the thing we have made and the things we have made of ourselves on the other.''' ,'''While there is a chance of the world getting through its troubles, I hold that a reasonable man has to behave as though he were sure of it.
