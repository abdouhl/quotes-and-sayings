- It's not just a revue where one song is done, then another. There are concepts and ideas at work.
- Above all, I try to create an emotion to which others can respond.
- Pop songs are not as graceful as they used to be. Performers today haven't gone through the regimen of learning how to write. And of course, everyone wants to own copyrights.
- One thing a lyricist must learn is not to fall in love with his own lines. Once you learn that, you can walk away from the lyric and look at it with a reasonable degree of objectivity.
