quotes = ['''My parents have been with me every step of the way.''' ,'''I definitely I prefer to sing in the car.

They should know how to work the stage.''' ,'''The kind of audience I'm speaking to is a very wide range of people.''' ,'''My parents have basically just taught me the rules of the stage and everything since I was eight.''' ,'''If there's a pool I love to hangout there and layout and get some sun. If I can ever find a second to get some sun, some Vitamin D, I will do so.''' ,'''It's always been a dream of mine to get somewhere and to have my mom and dad with me up there.''' ,'''Performing on stage is what I've done since I was a kid and it's where the passion that has started from the very beginning for me, and that's what I'm going to enjoy.''' ,'''If I were to categorize what I sing, I have many different influences, and a lot of them are from back in time.''' ,]
