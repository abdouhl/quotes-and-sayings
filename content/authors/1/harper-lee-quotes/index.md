- So many writers don't like to write... I like to write, and sometimes I'm afraid I like it too much, because when I get into work, I don't want to leave it. And as a result, I'll go for days and days and days without leaving my house.

- You've really got to start hitting the books because it's no joke out here.
- You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view.
- The book to read is not the one which thinks for you, but the one which makes you think. No book in the world equals the Bible for that.
