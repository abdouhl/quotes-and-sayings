- I don't care about the money. I'm just interested in the perks. I'll do a series if I am picked up by a limo, work only until 4, and the show is shot in Hawaii.
- I don't know if 'M*A*S*H' made me a better actor, but I know it made me a better human being.

- I've never been more comfortable in a part than with Colonel Potter.
- I'd like to be remembered for being a fairly pleasant person and for having gotten along for the most part with a lot of the people I've worked with. And for having a wonderful life and for having enjoyed practically every minute of it... I think I'm one of the luckiest people in the world.
- The thing that made 'M*A*S*H' so good was the fact that we did have those relationships off-camera and took them on-camera.

- An actor's most important responsibility is to know lines well.
- Television allowed me to kick the Hollywood habit of typing an actor in certain roles.
