That's not productive at all.''' ,'''I have no beliefs of a religious kind.''' ,'''It's fair to say that, for much of my lifetime, New Zealand certainly was a property-owning democracy and working people, ordinary people, had assets.''' ,'''If you neglect those who are currently poor and stable, you may create more poor and unstable people.

And that we are not the old-fashioned, ship mutton kind of product the people associate their export in work.''' ,'''Although biodiversity loss continues globally, many countries are significantly slowing the rate of loss by shoring up protected natural areas and the services they provide, and in expanding national park systems with tighter management and more secure funding.''' ,'''I think it's inevitable that New Zealand will become a republic and that would reflect the reality that New Zealand is a totally sovereign-independent 21st century nation 12,000 miles from the United Kingdom.''' ,'''Well in the end the world can crank itself up to sanctions, as it has with Zimbabwe, another sad case.''' ,'''Business can talk itself into a blue funk.''' ,'''I think the issue of North Korea is one where the international community as a whole has to work to resolve the crisis.''' ,'''We're a nation in search of an identity, but it's quite exciting.
