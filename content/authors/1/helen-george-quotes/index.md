quotes = ['''I loved 'Truly Madly Deeply' and all those 1990s romcoms because you had great actresses like Juliet Stevenson and Emma Thompson starting out.''' ,'''I have two dogs, Lottie and Charlie.''' ,'''I buy things through the ShopStyle app on my phone, then have them delivered to a neighbour so Oliver doesn't see them arrive. When he's out, I collect them, cut off the labels, and bury them deep in the recycling box under the wine bottles.''' ,'''I've been to L.A. before, and I love the sunshine and the fact that people seem so genuinely nice and pleased to see you - which is so different from London. Maybe I'll end up so tired of smiles and helpfulness that I'll long for the rudeness and cynicism of home.''' ,'''I'm not sure filming a birth is as hard as actual labour, but it's a really long, arduous day!''' ,'''I'm not sure you can lindy hop to 'We're All In This Together,' but I'm sure the nuns would welcome Zac Efron round for tea!''' ,'''I love having my cards read - if you go to a proper place, they wouldn't dream of telling you anything awful that is going to happen.''' ,'''I love 'Girls.' The writing is so clever. I think Lena Dunham is a genius. I can't believe she writes it, directs it and stars in it. It's really exciting that a young woman has been able to achieve all of that.''' ,'''I love 'Call the Midwife'; it's an absolute gem of a programme. Filming the Christmas special and then the second series felt like going back to a boarding school that you really love and is full of friends.''' ,]
