- Dancing is just like racing. You don't learn choreography. They just give you steps to do, and you do them over and over and over. It's very much like what I do in racing.
- If you don't finish half of the races, you are not going to have a very good season.
- I like people with a good sense of humor, like Jennifer Aniston. She is amazing and is a great actress.
- I have not changed much. I haven't gotten a big ego or anything.
- To be honest, Brazilian people are fun people, and the country is amazing. It's full of beautiful people. I love the beaches.
- When I'm driving the race track, it's all about repetition.
- I don't think I would be a good actor! People enjoyed 'Dancing With the Stars' because I was myself, and every time they told me to say something, I would say my own words, so I don't think I could follow a script well!
