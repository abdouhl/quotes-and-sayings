- Whatever attitudes we habitually use toward ourselves, we will use on others, and whatever attitudes we habitually use toward others, we will use on ourselves.
- Meditation changes your character.
- Mindfulness helps us freeze the frame so that we can become aware of our sensations and experiences as they are, without the distorting coloration of socially conditioned responses or habitual reactions.

- The brain does not manufacture thoughts unless we stimulate it with habitual verbalizing. When we train ourselves by constant practice to stop verbalizing, the brain can experience things as they are.
- Watch the functioning of your own mind in a calm and detached manner so you can gain insight into your own behavior.
- You can't ever get everything you want. It is impossible. Luckily, there is another option: You can learn to control your mind, to step outside of the endless cycle of desire and aversion.
- Peace is not a thought, not a concept; it is a nonverbal experience.
- When you have learned compassion for yourself, compassion for others is automatic.
- Don't cling to anything and don't reject anything.
- The purpose of meditation is personal transformation.
- You can learn not to want what you want, to recognize desires but not be controlled by them.
