The triumph of life is expressed by creation.''' ,'''It seems that laughter needs an echo.''' ,'''There is nothing in philosophy which could not be said in everyday language.''' ,'''Genius is that which forces the inertia of humanity to learn.''' ,'''To perceive means to immobilize... we seize, in the act of perception, something which outruns perception itself.''' ,'''Instinct perfected is a faculty of using and even constructing organized instruments; intelligence perfected is the faculty of making and using unorganized instruments.''' ,'''In laughter we always find an unavowed intention to humiliate and consequently to correct our neighbour.''' ,'''Religion is to mysticism what popularization is to science.''' ,'''And I also see how this body influences external images: it gives back movement to them.''' ,'''Sex appeal is the keynote of our civilization.''' ,'''Homo sapiens, the only creature endowed with reason, is also the only creature to pin its existence on things unreasonable.''' ,'''Wherever anything lives, there is, open somewhere, a register in which time is being inscribed.''' ,'''When we make the cerebral state the beginning of an action, and in no sense the condition of a perception, we place the perceived images of things outside the image of our body, and thus replace perception within the things themselves.''' ,'''For life is tendency, and the essence of a tendency is to develop in the form of a sheaf, creating, by its very growth, divergent directions among which its impetus is divided.''' ,'''A situation is always comic if it participates simultaneously in two series of events which are absolutely independent of each other, and if it can be interpreted in two quite different meanings.''' ,]
