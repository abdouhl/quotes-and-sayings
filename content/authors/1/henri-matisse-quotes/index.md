He must identify himself with her rhythm, by efforts that will prepare the mastery which will later enable him to express himself in his own language.''' ,'''Work cures everything.''' ,'''What I dream of is an art of balance, of purity and serenity devoid of troubling or depressing subject matter - a soothing, calming influence on the mind, rather like a good armchair which provides relaxation from physical fatigue.''' ,'''Derive happiness in oneself from a good day's work, from illuminating the fog that surrounds us.''' ,'''I would like to recapture that freshness of vision which is characteristic of extreme youth when all the world is new to it.''' ,'''I have always tried to hide my efforts and wished my works to have a light joyousness of springtime which never lets anyone suspect the labors it has cost me.''' ,'''In love, the one who runs away is the winner.''' ,'''Creativity takes courage.''' ,'''I wouldn't mind turning into a vermilion goldfish.''' ,'''With color one obtains an energy that seems to stem from witchcraft.''' ,'''He who loves, flies, runs, and rejoices; he is free and nothing holds him back.''' ,'''Drawing is like making an expressive gesture with the advantage of permanence.''' ,'''Jazz is rhythm and meaning.''' ,'''Cutting into color reminds me of the sculptor's direct carving.''' ,'''I don't paint things. I only paint the difference between things.''' ,'''It has bothered me all my life that I do not paint like everybody else.''' ,'''I'm growing old, I delight in the past.''' ,]
