But a collection of facts is no more a science than a heap of stones is a house.''' ,'''Absolute space, that is to say, the mark to which it would be necessary to refer the earth to know whether it really moves, has no objective existence.''' ,'''If nature were not beautiful, it would not be worth knowing, and if nature were not worth knowing, life would not be worth living.''' ,'''It is the harmony of the diverse parts, their symmetry, their happy balance; in a word it is all that introduces order, all that gives unity, that permits us to see clearly and to comprehend at once both the ensemble and the details.''' ,'''Mathematicians are born, not made.''' ,'''The mathematical facts worthy of being studied are those which, by their analogy with other facts, are capable of leading us to the knowledge of a physical law.''' ,'''A scientist worthy of his name, about all a mathematician, experiences in his work the same impression as an artist; his pleasure is as great and of the same nature.''' ,'''It is through science that we prove, but through intuition that we discover.''' ,'''A small error in the former will produce an enormous error in the latter.''' ,'''In the old days when people invented a new function they had something useful in mind.''' ,'''Need we add that mathematicians themselves are not infallible?''' ,'''The scientist does not study nature because it is useful; he studies it because he delights in it, and he delights in it because it is beautiful.''' ,'''To doubt everything, or, to believe everything, are two equally convenient solutions; both dispense with the necessity of reflection.''' ,'''Facts do not speak.''' ,'''If one looks at the different problems of the integral calculus which arise naturally when one wishes to go deep into the different parts of physics, it is impossible not to be struck by the analogies existing.''' ,]
