quotes = ['''I have removed the spleen from a dog, from cats, and rabbits. In all cases, the animals survived the operation and did not appear to be in the least affected by the absence of the organ.''' ,'''The muscles are connected with the bones, cartilages, ligaments, and skin, either directly or through the intervention of fibrous structures called tendons or aponeuroses.''' ,'''I believe that the power which the spleen possesses of regulating its amount of blood depends entirely upon mechanical properties.''' ,'''The general framework of the body is built up mainly of a series of bones, supplemented, however, in certain regions by pieces of cartilage; the bony part of the framework constitutes the skeleton.''' ,'''Descriptive Anatomy comprises a detailed account of the numerous organs of which the body is formed, especially with reference to their outward form, their internal structure, the mutual relations they bear to each other, and the successive conditions they present during their development.''' ,'''Surgical Anatomy is, to the student of medicine and surgery, the most essential branch of anatomical science, having reference more especially to an accurate knowledge of the more important regions, and consisting in the application of anatomy generally to the practice of surgery.''' ,'''The eyeball is contained in the cavity of the orbit. In this situation, it is securely protected from injury, whilst its position is such as to ensure the most extensive range of sight.''' ,'''The vesicles of the spleen, which form one of the most important elements of this organ in its mature state, are not developed until the period of incubation is near to its completion.''' ,'''In the dissection of the muscles, attention should be directed to the exact origin, insertion, and actions of each, and to its more important relations with surrounding parts.''' ,'''Fracture of the patella may be produced by muscular action or by direct violence. When produced by muscular action, it occurs thus: a person in danger of falling forwards attempts to recover himself by throwing the body backwards, and the violent action of the quadriceps extensor upon the patella snaps the bone transversely across.''' ,'''The earliest period at which I have been able to detect the existence of the spleen in the human embryo is at the second month.''' ,'''Bone is one of the hardest structures of the animal body; it possesses also a certain degree of toughness and elasticity.''' ,'''The arteries are found in nearly every part of the animal body, with the exception of the hairs, nails, and epidermis; and the larger trunks usually occupy the most protected situations, running, in the limbs, along the flexor side, where they are less exposed to injury.''' ,'''The appendages of the skin are the nails, the hairs, the sudoriferous and sebaceous glands, and their ducts. The nails and hairs are peculiar modifications of the epidermis, consisting essentially of the same cellular structure as that membrane.''' ,'''In the imperfect records left of the anatomy of the ancient Egyptians, no trace of any knowledge of the spleen can be ascertained.''' ,'''The entire substance of the spleen at an early period is almost entirely composed of nuclei and granular matter.''' ,]
