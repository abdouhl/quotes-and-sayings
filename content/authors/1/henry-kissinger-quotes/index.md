quotes = ['''I have been a professor, and I have been a policymaker, and as a professor, you think in terms of truth or absolutes.''' ,'''I think that America's recovery of a global strategic view is an absolutely essential element of our foreign policy.''' ,'''If you don't know where you are going, every road will get you nowhere.''' ,'''University politics are vicious precisely because the stakes are so small.''' ,'''The essence of Richard Nixon is loneliness.''' ,'''Any fact that needs to be disclosed should be put out now or as quickly as possible, because otherwise the bleeding will not end.''' ,'''The security of Israel is a moral imperative for all free peoples.''' ,'''The tragedy of America is that it entered all the wars with a consensus in favor of them, but within a defined period, the legitimacy of the war became a major domestic issue, with some people arguing that withdrawal was the only legitimate objective.''' ,'''Every first-term president has to learn something after he comes into office. Nobody can be completely ready for the inevitable crises.''' ,'''There has come into being a kind of a Shia belt from Tehran through Baghdad to Beirut. And this gives Iran the opportunity to reconstruct the ancient Persian Empire - this time under the Shia label.''' ,'''For other nations, utopia is a blessed past never to be recovered; for Americans it is just beyond the horizon.''' ,'''I don't see why we need to stand by and watch a country go communist due to the irresponsibility of its people. The issues are much too important for the Chilean voters to be left to decide for themselves.''' ,'''Everybody has a hacking capability. And probably every intelligence service is hacking in the territory of other countries. But who exactly does what? That would be a very sensitive piece of information. But it's very difficult to communicate about it. Because nobody wants to admit the scope of what they're doing.''' ,'''People are generally amazed that I would take an interest in any forum that would require me to stop talking for three hours.''' ,'''Leadership is absolutely vital if there are comparable countries which can affect the security of the world you live in. Between Lincoln and Roosevelt's time, America was protected by huge oceans and, in practice, by the British navy. Today, it's different, and the obsession of the Obama administration has been for retrenchment.''' ,'''My view of my role is that together with like-minded men and women, I could help contribute to a bipartisan view of American engagement in the world for another period; I could do my part to overcome this really, in a way, awful period in which we are turning history into personal recriminations, depriving our political system of a serious debate.''' ,'''The high probability is if American forces withdraw from Afghanistan and if no alternative international arrangement is made that then the historic contests between the regions and the sects will reappear, the Taliban will re-emerge, and a very complicated and maybe chaotic situation will develop.''' ,'''Whatever must happen ultimately should happen immediately.''' ,'''Donald Trump is a phenomenon that foreign countries haven't seen. So it is a shocking experience to them that he came in to office.''' ,'''Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton both had exceptional natural abilities. Nelson Rockefeller was very good statewide but never gained national traction.''' ,'''No country can act wisely simultaneously in every part of the globe at every moment of time.''' ,'''A leader does not deserve the name unless he is willing occasionally to stand alone.''' ,'''America has fought five wars since 1945 and has gained its objectives in only one of them, the Gulf War.''' ,'''I have spoken to Chinese leaders occasionally on human rights, but I've always done it in private.''' ,'''No one will ever win the battle of the sexes; there's too much fraternizing with the enemy.''' ,'''Even a paranoid can have enemies.''' ,'''Diplomacy: the art of restraining power.''' ,'''A leader who confines his role to his people's experience dooms himself to stagnation; a leader who outstrips his people's experience runs the risk of not being understood.''' ,'''Leaders must invoke an alchemy of great vision.''' ,'''There cannot be a crisis next week. My schedule is already full.''' ,'''Power is the great aphrodisiac.''' ,'''If eighty percent of your sales come from twenty percent of all of your items, just carry those twenty percent.''' ,'''It was a Greek tragedy. Nixon was fulfilling his own nature. Once it started it could not end otherwise.''' ,'''If it's going to come out eventually, better have it come out immediately.''' ,'''While we should never give up our principles, we must also realize that we cannot maintain our principles unless we survive.''' ,'''The conventional army loses if it does not win. The guerrilla wins if he does not lose.''' ,'''The American temptation is to believe that foreign policy is a subdivision of psychiatry.''' ,'''The Vietnam War was a great tragedy for our country. And it is now far enough away so that one can study without using the slogans to see what's really happened.''' ,'''The statesman's duty is to bridge the gap between his nation's experience and his vision.''' ,'''A president has an inescapable responsibility to provide direction: What are we trying to achieve? What are we trying to prevent? Why? To do that, he has to both analyze and reflect.''' ,'''Each success only buys an admission ticket to a more difficult problem.''' ,'''There is obviously a gap between the public's perception of the role of U.S. foreign policy and the elite's perception.''' ,'''The Vietnam War required us to emphasize the national interest rather than abstract principles. What President Nixon and I tried to do was unnatural. And that is why we didn't make it.''' ,'''If I should ever be captured, I want no negotiation - and if I should request a negotiation from captivity they should consider that a sign of duress.''' ,'''Moderation is a virtue only in those who are thought to have an alternative.''' ,'''I am being frank about myself in this book. I tell of my first mistake on page 850.''' ,'''The American foreign policy trauma of the sixties and seventies was caused by applying valid principles to unsuitable conditions.''' ,'''I don't see the wisdom in modern politicians that I once saw in men like Dean Acheson, David Bruce, or George Marshall. In my day, the northeastern establishment dominated foreign policy formulation, but the composition and distribution of our population is very different today.''' ,'''The Trump phenomenon is in large part a reaction of Middle America to attacks on its values by intellectual and academic communities. There are other reasons, but this is a significant one.''' ,'''The task of the leader is to get his people from where they are to where they have not been.''' ,'''Blessed are the people whose leaders can look destiny in the eye without flinching but also without attempting to play God.''' ,'''The nice thing about being a celebrity is that, if you bore people, they think it's their fault.''' ,'''We are moving towards a world that is reordering itself and that may appear more ordered at some periods of time, but I see no sign that we are moving towards a world order in my definition of it - namely, a system which is accepted, which is internalized by the majority of the key participants.''' ,'''The superpowers often behave like two heavily armed blind men feeling their way around a room, each believing himself in mortal peril from the other, whom he assumes to have perfect vision.''' ,'''We are all the President's men.''' ,'''Most foreign policies that history has marked highly, in whatever country, have been originated by leaders who were opposed by experts.''' ,'''To be absolutely certain about something, one must know everything or nothing about it.''' ,'''I have not endorsed Trump and will not do so.''' ,'''I think when the president of the United States calls for military action, he should do it for a united people, especially when the methods have been so cruel, so explicitly directed at Americans.''' ,'''We cannot always assure the future of our friends; we have a better chance of assuring our future if we remember who our friends are.''' ,'''It is, after all, the responsibility of the expert to operate the familiar and that of the leader to transcend it.''' ,'''The longer I am out of office, the more infallible I appear to myself.''' ,'''I don't ascribe to myself any special competence in economic insight. I translate what I hear from highly intelligent people into political and philosophical propositions.''' ,'''Accept everything about yourself - I mean everything, You are you and that is the beginning and the end - no apologies, no regrets.''' ,'''You can't make war in the Middle East without Egypt and you can't make peace without Syria.''' ,'''Ninety percent of the politicians give the other ten percent a bad reputation.''' ,'''The attitude of the West and of Russia towards a crisis like Ukraine is diametrically different. The West is trying to establish the legality of any established border. For Russia, Ukraine is part of the Russian patrimony.''' ,'''High office teaches decision making, not substance. It consumes intellectual capital; it does not create it. Most high officials leave office with the perceptions and insights with which they entered; they learn how to make decisions but not what decisions to make.''' ,'''The illegal we do immediately. The unconstitutional takes a little longer.''' ,'''It's never happened in history that every region in the world could affect every other region simultaneously. The Roman empire and the Chinese empire didn't know much about each other and had no means of interacting. Now we have every continent able to reach every other.''' ,'''No foreign policy - no matter how ingenious - has any chance of success if it is born in the minds of a few and carried in the hearts of none.''' ,'''The absence of alternatives clears the mind marvelously.''' ,'''In crises the most daring course is often safest.''' ,'''Art is man's expression of his joy in labor.''' ,'''Leaders are responsible not for running public opinion polls but for the consequences of their actions.''' ,'''I think we would find, if you study the conduct of guerilla-type wars, that the Obama Administration has hit more targets on a broader scale than the Nixon Administration ever did.''' ,]
