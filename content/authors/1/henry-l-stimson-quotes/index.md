quotes = ['''I think it is very important that I should have a talk with you as soon as possible on a highly secret matter. I mentioned it to you shortly after you took office but have not urged it since on account of the pressure you have been under.''' ,'''It seems as if everybody in the country was getting impatient to get his or her particular soldier out of the Army and to upset the carefully arranged system of points for retirement which we had arranged with the approval of the Army itself.''' ,'''I told him that my own opinion was that the time now and the method now to deal with Russia was to keep our mouths shut and let our actions speak for words.''' ,'''I do not see how the Japanese can hold out against this united front.''' ,'''Russia will occupy most of the good food lands of central Europe while we have the industrial portions. We must find some way of persuading Russia to play ball.''' ,'''The only deadly sin I know is cynicism.''' ,'''I told him there was one city that they must not bomb without my permission and that was Kyoto.''' ,'''We think it will be shortly afterwards, but it seems a terrible thing to gamble with such big stakes in diplomacy without having your master card in your hand.''' ,'''Now the thing is not to get into unnecessary quarrels by talking too much and not to indicate any weakness by talking too much; let our actions speak for themselves.''' ,'''The President so far has struck me as a man who is trying hard to keep his balance.

These two heavy blows have fallen in quick succession upon the Japanese and there will be quite a little space before we intend to drop another.''' ,]
