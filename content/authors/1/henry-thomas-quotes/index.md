- I grew up in a rural area, I was from kind of a poor family and my parents weren't showbiz people. But going back was strange, and perhaps stranger for the other students.
- I was getting a lot of hassles from the public. Everybody recognized me.
- Of course there have been times I regretted being the kid in 'E.T.' My world went completely crazy. I was that stupid kind of famous, where you can't go anywhere.
- My son, who is 7, he passed a car in a parking lot that was probably a 1998 model, and he said, 'Wow, Dad, look at that old car.' I was looking around for an old car, and I realized that my old car maybe stops at 1965.
- The hardest thing about being a kid actor is just kind of separating 'this is my professional life' and 'this is my kid life.' That was always the hard part for me.

- Even if I had a tuxedo I wouldn't wear it to school.
- I got so tired of everybody talking about 'Stranger Things,' I think I developed a mental block against watching it.
- I understood why films were made, and if they made a lot of money, they were successful. All of these things I knew. As a ten-year-old boy, I didn't really think a lot about finances or celebrity. I always viewed films as kind of what I imagined a summer camp to be like.
- The idea of a film staying in theaters for a year is something of a fantasy today.
- Carloads of tourists would photograph the family mailbox, and there was weird mail, death threats.
