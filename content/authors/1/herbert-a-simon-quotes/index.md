quotes = ['''I started off thinking that maybe the social sciences ought to have the kinds of mathematics that the natural sciences had. That works a little bit in economics because they talk about costs, prices and quantities of goods.''' ,'''A wealth of information creates a poverty of attention.''' ,'''In arguing that machines think, we are in the same fix as Darwin when he argued that man shares common ancestors with monkeys, or Galileo when he argued that the Earth spins on its axis.''' ,'''One of the first rules of science is if somebody delivers a secret weapon to you, you better use it.''' ,'''What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention, and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of information sources that might consume it.''' ,'''When computers came along, I felt for the first time that I had the proper tools for the kind of theoretical work I wanted to do. So I moved over to that, and that got me into psychology.''' ,'''Engineering, medicine, business, architecture and painting are concerned not with the necessary but with the contingent - not with how things are but with how they might be - in short, with design.''' ,'''The classical theory of omniscient rationality is strikingly simple and beautiful.''' ,'''The density of settlement of economists over the whole empire of economic science is very uneven, with a few areas of modest size holding the bulk of the population.''' ,'''The social sciences, I thought, needed the same kind of rigor and the same mathematical underpinnings that had made the 'hard' sciences so brilliantly successful.''' ,'''I tried to develop some theories that took account of the uncertainty in the world and the complexity in the world.''' ,'''No one has characterized market mechanisms better than Friedrich von Hayek.''' ,'''In the computer field, the moment of truth is a running program; all else is prophecy.''' ,'''Among my European ancestors were piano builders, goldsmiths, and vintners but, to the best of my knowledge, no professionals of any kind.''' ,'''Technology may create a condition, but the questions are what do we do about ourselves. We better understand ourselves pretty clearly and we better find ways to like ourselves.''' ,'''My research career has been devoted to understanding human decision-making and problem-solving processes. The pursuit of this goal has led me into the fields of political science, economics, cognitive psychology, computer science and philosophy of science, among others.''' ,'''I was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on June 15, 1916. My father, an electrical engineer, had come to the United States in 1903 after earning his engineering diploma at the Technische Hochschule of Darmstadt, Germany.''' ,'''Everyone designs who devises courses of action aimed at changing existing situations into preferred ones.''' ,'''There are no morals about technology at all. Technology expands our ways of thinking about things, expands our ways of doing things. If we're bad people we use technology for bad purposes and if we're good people we use it for good purposes.''' ,'''I don't care how big and fast computers are, they're not as big and fast as the world.''' ,'''My home nurtured in me an early attachment to books and other things of the intellect, to music, and to the out of doors.''' ,'''The proper study of mankind is the science of design.''' ,'''I realized that you could formulate theories about human and social phenomena in language and pictures and whatever you wanted on the computer, and you didn't have to go through this straitjacket, adding a lot of numbers.''' ,'''Like Humpty Dumpty, we can make words mean anything we want them to mean.''' ,'''The world is vast, beautiful, and fascinating, even awe-inspiring - but impersonal. It demands nothing of me, and allows me to demand nothing of it.''' ,'''Learning is any change in a system that produces a more or less permanent change in its capacity for adapting to its environment.''' ,'''By a combination of formal training and self study, the latter continuing systematically well into the 1940s, I was able to gain a broad base of knowledge in economics and political science, together with reasonable skills in advanced mathematics, symbolic logic, and mathematical statistics.''' ,'''All correct reasoning is a grand system of tautologies, but only God can make direct use of that fact.''' ,'''Anything that gives us new knowledge gives us an opportunity to be more rational.''' ,'''Human beings, viewed as behaving systems, are quite simple. The apparent complexity of our behavior over time is largely a reflection of the complexity of the environment in which we find ourselves.''' ,'''The choices we make lead up to actual experiences. It is one thing to decide to climb a mountain. It is quite another to be on top of it.''' ,'''Forget about Nobel prizes; they aren't really very important.''' ,'''Most of us really aren't horribly unique. There are 6 billion of us. Put 'em all in one room and very few would stand out as individuals. So maybe we ought to think of worth in terms of our ability to get along as a part of nature, rather than being the lords over nature.''' ,'''To deal with these problems - of world population and hunger, of peace, of energy and mineral resources, of environmental pollution, of poverty - we must broaden and deepen our knowledge of nature's laws, and we must broaden and deepen our understanding of the laws of human behavior.''' ,'''Maybe we ought to have a world in which things are divided between people kind of fairly.''' ,'''Whereas economic man maximises, selects the best alternative from among all those available to him, his cousin, administrative man, satisfices, looks for a course of action that is satisfactory or 'good enough'.''' ,'''The Nobel prizes memorialize Alfred Nobel's faith in the contribution that human thought, directed to science and art, can make to human welfare.''' ,'''Human knowledge has been changing from the word go and people in certain respects behave more rationally than they did when they didn't have it. They spend less time doing rain dances and more time seeding clouds.''' ,'''I think those who object to my characterizing man as simple want somehow to retain a deep mystery at his core.''' ,'''You can love two or more women at once... but you cannot be loyal to more than one.''' ,'''Time and again, we have found the 'idle' truths arrived at through the process of inquiry to be of the greatest moment for practical human affairs.''' ,'''Viewed as a geometric figure, the ant's path is irregular, complex, and hard to describe.''' ,'''I like to think that since I was about 19, I have studied human decision-making and problem-solving.''' ,'''The engineer, and more generally the designer, is concerned with how things ought to be - how they ought to be in order to attain goals, and to function.''' ,'''What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients.''' ,'''One finds limits by pushing them.''' ,]
