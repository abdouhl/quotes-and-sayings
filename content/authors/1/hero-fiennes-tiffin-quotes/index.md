quotes = ['''There are lots of professions where your social following is key now. But chasing followers is strange to me. I'd rather focus on the work.''' ,'''I never actually got noticed on the street for 'Harry Potter.' I did it at such a young age, when I was going through puberty and changing up my hair and how I looked.''' ,'''I've always wanted to demonstrate a variety of different roles when I act and do different projects and not ever do one of the same.''' ,'''I feel like I don't have much of a preference. With TV, it's just a longer process, so you need to be more sure that you really want to be involved in it for a longer time than you would be with film.''' ,'''I definitely devote so much more time to acting, but since it only takes a day or two to shoot and get pictures out - whereas for acting, you do an audition, or loads, and you might not get any of them - so I did the modeling stuff because, obviously, if I have the opportunity, I'm going to take it.''' ,'''If you're good, you'll get work.

Anytime I do see them, they always check up on it and make sure everything's okay and let me know that they're there for me.''' ,'''I'd love to be involved in the process of adapting a book to a script, but that's simply not my job.''' ,'''Modeling stuff is cool - obviously you get to travel and wear cool clothes, take cool pictures, meet cool people - but for me, acting is a lot more creatively fulfilling, so I've always put it first.''' ,'''In the small amount of modeling work I've done, I'm always told that I never smile.''' ,]
