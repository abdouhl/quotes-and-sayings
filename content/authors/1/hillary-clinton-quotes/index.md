One of them will be successful.''' ,'''I'm too old to be a yuppie.''' ,'''I don't think about a legacy; I think about my life, because I've had quite an unpredictable life.''' ,'''You can look at what I did in the Senate. I did introduce legislation to rein in compensation. I looked at ways that the shareholders would have more control over what was going on in that arena. And specifically said to Wall Street, that what they were doing in the mortgage market was bringing our country down.''' ,'''Individual consciences are fine but individual consciences have to be made manifest.''' ,'''I believe climate change is real and that we can save our planet while creating millions of good-paying clean energy jobs.''' ,'''I happen to have given lots of free speeches.''' ,'''And we'll build a path to citizenship for millions of immigrants who are already contributing to our economy!''' ,'''When an army unit returns from service in Iraq or Afghanistan, it barely gets a breather before it begins training for its next deployment.''' ,'''Every marriage is a mystery to me, even the one I'm in.

Bush is very popular in Sub-Saharan Africa. Why?

I think it starts with where we are in the country at this time, with what Americans are thinking, feeling and hoping, and it proceeds from there. And it is always about the future.''' ,'''Democracy is still a radical idea in a world where we often confuse images with realities, words with actions.''' ,'''I learned to be far more skeptical of what I'm told by presidents, no matter who the presidents are, and also to be much more cautious, always, in any action or vote that could lead to the use of American military power and most particularly what we call 'boots on the ground.'''' ,'''I believe America thrives when the middle class thrives.''' ,'''I'll get involved in philanthropy.''' ,'''I represented Wall Street, as a senator from New York, and I went to Wall Street in December of 2007 - before the big crash that we had - I basically said, 'Cut it out!

From my first day in office to my last, especially in places that for too long have been left out and left behind.''' ,'''I don't have any comment on who the people of Russia choose to be their leaders.''' ,'''This is what we call smart power. Using every possible tool and partner to advance peace and security. Leaving no one on the sidelines. Showing respect even for one's enemies. Trying to understand, in so far as psychologically possible, empathize with their perspective and point of view. Helping to define the problems, determine the solutions.''' ,'''Now, look, I - I like to look at evidence. I plead to that. I think evidence is important when you're making decisions that affect other people's lives.''' ,'''When I traveled as secretary of state, I was deluged with thick briefing books full of information about the politics, economy, and culture of each destination, so those took up most of my reading time.''' ,'''This is a moment in history where it is almost hard to catch your breath.''' ,'''I think I'm chronically exhausted.''' ,'''It should never be a crime to be gay.''' ,'''Showing up is not all of life - but it counts for a lot.''' ,'''At the end of the day, you know, love does not happen between two perfect people as much as we would wish.''' ,'''I get it that some people just don't know what to make of me.''' ,'''Going out and playing football or baseball with the boys, when I was a tomboy, was a great way to learn about winning and losing, and most girls didn't have that experience.''' ,'''Both the American people and nations that censor the internet should understand that our government is committed to helping promote internet freedom.''' ,'''I feel very blessed to have a partner in life who supports me, who is enthusiastic about what I want to do, who has been a great father, and who will be a fabulous grandfather.''' ,'''I love New York.''' ,'''Probably my worst quality is that I get very passionate about what I think is right.''' ,'''Egypt is a large, complex, very important country.''' ,'''I don't think I've read any of the books that have been written about me.''' ,'''I've had extraordinary good luck with my health, other than a broken elbow.''' ,'''Wealthy women have rights in every country. And poor women don't.''' ,'''There are 4 billion cell phones in use today. Many of them are in the hands of market vendors, rickshaw drivers, and others who've historically lacked access to education and opportunity. Information networks have become a great leveler, and we should use them together to help lift people out of poverty and give them a freedom from want.''' ,'''I have to tell you, as your Secretary of State, I went to 112 countries, and when people hear those words, they hear America. So don't let anyone tell you that our country is weak. We're not. Don't let anyone tell you we don't have what it takes. We do.''' ,'''We can't go to people who have lost their job at GM and say, 'Oh, by the way, we are going to pay money to build a road here or inoculate children there,' unless we can demonstrate that it is in America's interest.

I know it. Every woman I know knows it, whether you're in the media as a woman, or you're in the professions or business or politics.''' ,'''I mean, honestly, we have to be clear that the life for many Afghan women is not that much different than it was a hundred years ago, 200 years ago. The country has lived with so much violence and conflict that many people, men and women, just want it to be over.''' ,'''A psychologist once told me that for a boy being in the middle of a conflict between two women is the worst possible situation.

Will we stay true to that motto?''' ,'''I'm in charge of the State Department's 60,000-plus people all over the world, 275 posts.''' ,'''I really get up every day and try to deal with the problems that are in front of me, and I don't really worry about history. That will work itself out over time.''' ,'''I've never understood the division between so-called realists and so-called idealists.''' ,'''I think it's fair to say that diplomacy today requires much more of that if you're the United States of America than it did 10, 20, 30, 40 years ago.''' ,'''All of us have to recognize that we owe our children more than we have been giving them.''' ,'''The importance of building relationships among colleagues, of trying to create coalitions behind the issues that you are championing, was not something I ever had much insight into until I was elected and started serving in the Senate.''' ,'''Good grief, we're getting offended by everything these days! People can't say anything without offending somebody.''' ,'''The United States strongly condemns the illegal disclosure of classified information. It puts people's lives in danger, threatens our national security, and undermines our efforts to work with other countries to solve shared problems.''' ,'''I try to read for pleasure whenever I can - it's a great way just to shut it off for a while so your brain doesn't get fried.''' ,'''We have to knock down the barriers erected by greed, special interests, powerful forces.''' ,'''Gay rights are human rights.''' ,'''We'll hold out our hand; they have to unclench their fist.''' ,'''The worst thing that can happen in a democracy - as well as in an individual's life - is to become cynical about the future and lose hope.''' ,'''My father was a small-businessman, and if he didn't get up and go to work, there would be no business.''' ,'''If you get so unequal that people believe they don't have a chance, that the field isn't level for them and their children, that puts democracy at risk.''' ,'''My biggest, you know, regret is what happened in Benghazi. It was a terrible tragedy losing four Americans - two diplomats and, now it's public so I can say, two CIA operatives.''' ,'''When my hair was shorter, I used to get it done every couple of days... but I got tired of that.''' ,'''No nation can meet the world's challenges alone.''' ,'''I don't think we should be about the business of denying voters in Michigan and Florida the right to be heard.''' ,'''The American people are tired of liars and people who pretend to be something they're not.''' ,'''It's true that America can't solve every problem, but I don't know of any major problem in the world that can be solved without us.''' ,'''I've always been intrigued by the Senate, and admired many of the people who have served there.''' ,'''I want to work with my husband and my daughter on our mutual foundation interests.''' ,'''I am someone who hopes for the best and prepares for the worst.''' ,'''If I want to knock a story off the front page, I just change my hairstyle.''' ,'''One day after laying a wreath at the tomb of Martin Luther King Jr., President Bush appoints a federal judge who has built his career around dismantling Dr. King's legacy.''' ,'''Putin is playing the long game. He has a strategic plan in mind: the Eurasian Union, which would be in competition to Europe.''' ,'''I respect the Congress's oversight responsibility.''' ,'''I have been working or attending school full time since I was 13.''' ,'''The truth is, through all these years of public service, the 'service' part has always come easier to me than the 'public' part.''' ,'''I believe that eventually, one of the next big issues that will have to be addressed globally is the role of state-owned enterprises. Because there is a disadvantage that's built in.''' ,'''There is nothing fast or easy about diplomacy. I have no illusions about that.''' ,'''The family I'm from, well, no one had their name on big buildings. My family were builders of a different kind. Builders in the way most American families are. They used whatever tools they had - whatever God gave them - and whatever life in America provided - and built better lives and better futures for their kids.''' ,'''I helped to restore America's leadership.''' ,'''I am neither frustrated nor planning anything other than being the best Secretary of State I could be.''' ,'''Remember, the IDF, the Israeli Defense Forces, have a working relationship with the Palestinian Authority security forces, which have been incredibly professional.''' ,'''You know, my view is that we have a big world out there.''' ,'''It is past time for women to take their rightful place, side by side with men, in the rooms where the fates of peoples, where their children's and grandchildren's fates, are decided.''' ,'''There is no part of the world that is irrelevant to the United States anymore.''' ,'''And I will repeat today what I have said throughout this campaign. I will not raise taxes on the middle class. I will give you tax relief to help ease these burdens.''' ,'''People can judge me for what I've done. And I think when somebody's out in the public eye, that's what they do. So I'm fully comfortable with who I am, what I stand for, and what I've always stood for.''' ,'''Don't let anybody tell you it's corporations and businesses create jobs. You know that old theory, 'trickle-down economics.' That has been tried, that has failed. It has failed rather spectacularly.''' ,'''I am shocked at how much time I spend in the White House. I mean, you know, for people on the outside, the idea of going to the White House for a meeting must seem like the most important, serious, even glamorous kind of thing to do.''' ,'''Children today will grow up taking for granted that an African-American or a woman can, yes, become the president of the United States.''' ,'''I have a lot of stamina and I have a lot of resilience.''' ,'''To me you cannot be fully human, fully civilised, unless you recognise humanity in everyone.''' ,'''When women participate in peace-making and peace-keeping, we are all safer and more secure.''' ,'''A historic investment in jobs, debt-free college, profit sharing, making those at the top pay their fair share, putting families first in a modern economy and a democracy where working people's voices are actually heard. That is what we are fighting for in this election.''' ,'''Countries that will not tax their elite who expect us to come in and help them serve their people are just not going to get the kind of help from us that historically they may have.''' ,'''Now, I don't think President Obama and Vice President Biden get the credit they deserve for saving us from the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes. Our economy is so much stronger than when they took office.''' ,'''If you can't compete fairly, honestly, effectively, no government should intervene. Now, some governments do. They prop up failing industries.''' ,'''I certainly don't read coverage of me, I read what else is going on that I need to know about to do my job.''' ,'''I am not going to comment on what I did or did not say back in the late '90s.''' ,'''Women are the largest untapped reservoir of talent in the world.''' ,'''I wish I had some stock in a scrunchie company.''' ,'''You cannot have development in today's world without partnering with the private sector.''' ,'''Several people have told me that one of the most meaningful events they could attend would be something at the White House with their children.''' ,'''Sometimes, in public life, people ask inappropriate, off-the-wall kinds of questions, don't they?''' ,'''I fought all my life for women to make their own choices, in their personal and professional lives. I made mine.''' ,'''Many of you are well enough off that the tax cuts may have helped you. We're saying that for America to get back on track, we're probably going to cut that short and not give it to you. We're going to take things away from you on behalf of the common good.''' ,'''I'm not going to have some reporters pawing through our papers. We are the president.''' ,'''India has reduced its dependence on Iranian oil. I know their refineries have stopped asking for orders to purchase Iranian oil.''' ,'''I can't stand the kind of paralysis that some people fall into because they're not happy with the choices they've made.''' ,'''The most important questions for anybody thinking of running for president are not 'Will you run and can you win?' There is, 'What is your vision for America? And can you lead us there?'''' ,'''In almost every profession - whether it's law or journalism, finance or medicine or academia or running a small business - people rely on confidential communications to do their jobs. We count on the space of trust that confidentiality provides. When someone breaches that trust, we are all worse off for it.''' ,'''I think that we have to be constantly asking ourselves, 'How do we calculate the risk?' And sometimes we don't calculate it correctly; we either overstate it or understate it.''' ,'''There is no formula that I'm aware of for being a successful or fulfilled woman today.''' ,'''I was in civil society long before I was ever in politics or my husband was ever even elected president.''' ,'''My favorite short stories are by Alice Munro, especially her collections 'Carried Away' and 'Runaway.'''' ,'''On some campuses, change is effected through nonviolent or even violent means.''' ,'''When it comes to the Middle East, this is always a very difficult issue for any American president.''' ,'''I'm somebody who gets up every day and says, 'What am I going to do today, and how am I going to do it?' I think it moves me toward some outcome I'm hoping for and also has some, you know, some joy attached to it.''' ,'''There are some people in politics and in the press who can't be confused by the facts. They just will not live in an evidence-based world. And that's regrettable.''' ,'''I suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas.''' ,'''The challenge is to practice politics as the art of making what appears to be impossible, possible.''' ,'''When I was younger and women first started to get in public positions, in my case the law, we went through a period where we wore those little ribbon ties, little bows. We tried to figure out what was our appropriate dress.''' ,'''One of my goals upon becoming Secretary of State was to take diplomacy out of capitals, out of government offices, into the media, into the streets of countries.''' ,'''In the aftermath of September 11, and as the 9/11 Commission report so aptly demonstrates, it is clear that our intelligence system is not working the way that it should.''' ,'''I want to make a difference.''' ,'''You know no one will ever accuse me as having the same policies as George W. Bush.''' ,'''A nuclear-weapons armed Iran is not in anyone's human-rights interests. That is a direct threat to the lives and the livelihoods and the stability not only of the region but beyond.''' ,'''You cannot have maternal health without reproductive health.

That's part of living and coming to terms with who you are as a person.''' ,'''I sometimes think that I didn't leave the Republican Party, as much as it left me.''' ,'''I like live audiences, with real people - virtual reality is no substitute.''' ,'''As I speak to you today, government censors somewhere are working furiously to erase my words from the records of history. But history itself has already condemned these tactics.''' ,'''I want to teach. I want to speak. I want to travel.''' ,'''I have won elections and I have lost elections.''' ,'''The nuclear arsenal that Pakistan has, I believe is secure. I think the government and the military have taken adequate steps to protect that.''' ,'''Part of diplomacy is to open different definitions of self-interest.''' ,'''I mean, I'm a big believer in talking to people when you can and trying to solve problems when you can.''' ,'''With respect to Iraq, I did favour the continuity of American forces to work with the new Maliki government. They had enormous needs for intelligence, for training on everything from airplanes to more sophisticated ground equipment and the like.''' ,'''I am repeating the facts and the facts are I did not send nor did I receive material marked classified.''' ,'''Every president, if you watch what they look like when they come into office, you can see their hair turn white because it's such a hard job.''' ,'''Now, I have always believed that women are not victims; we are agents of change, we are drivers of progress, we are makers of peace - all we need is a fighting chance.''' ,'''I meet with people all day long.''' ,'''When I negotiated the ceasefire in Gaza with President Morsi, he was, you know, very involved.''' ,'''I think I'm very hardheaded.''' ,'''You feel sometimes when you hear analysts and knowledgeable people talking about Iran that they fear so much about the survival of the regime, because deep down it's not a legitimate regime, it doesn't represent the will of the people, it's kind of morphed into kind of a military theocracy.''' ,'''I take vitamins.''' ,'''Americans deserve to feel secure in their own lives, in their own middle-class aspirations, before you go to them and say, 'We're going to have to enforce navigable sea lanes in the South China Sea.'''' ,'''If a country doesn't recognize minority rights and human rights, including women's rights, you will not have the kind of stability and prosperity that is possible.''' ,'''I used to sit on the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue and wonder why the Senate was always going into recess, until in my first year I realized how intense the pressure was.''' ,'''I've spent so many years commuting, I kind of prefer a home office.''' ,'''We don't have enough support for maternal leave and the kinds of things that some of the European countries do. So we still make it hard on women to go into the work force and feel that they can be good at work but then doing the most important job, which is raising your children in a responsible and positive way.''' ,'''Everybody feels they have been trespassed upon, and nearly everybody has trespassed on somebody else, maybe not intentionally.''' ,'''Whether a woman's running for office or she's supporting her husband who's running for office and she gets criticised for wearing open-toed shoes or for the colour of her coat, there's just a lot of history that you bear if you are a woman who puts herself out in the political arena.''' ,'''There is a hunger for the United States to be present again.''' ,'''I feel like I have had the most amazing life in my public service.''' ,'''Well, I will be a president for Democrats, Republicans and independents, for the struggling, the striving, the successful, for all those who vote for me and for those who don't.

Just as much water as I can possibly drink.''' ,'''My two secrets to staying healthy: wash your hands all the time. And, if you can't, use Purell or one of the sanitizers. And the other is hot peppers. I eat a lot of hot peppers. I for some reason started doing that in 1992, and I swear by it.''' ,'''You have to test your ideas in a public forum.''' ,'''Well, I think both Russia and China have a very strong aversion to interference in internal affairs.''' ,'''When does life start? When does it end? Who makes these decisions?...

Bush and the White House then after 9/11, and I served with President Obama. I disagree with all three of those presidents on certain things.''' ,'''It became clear to me that simply caring is not enough. To drive real progress, you have to change both hearts and laws.

I did very well with it in Ohio.''' ,'''You know, just to be grossly generalistic, you could put half of Trump's supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables.
