Now I'm going to his house. It's surreal.''' ,'''What we had on was BBC Asian Network and Bollywood sound-tracks - they were my reference points. But of course, where I grew up, I was one of two Indian guys in my school, and I didn't really have anyone else to share that with.''' ,''''Blackbird' is a really beautiful song, and I actually recently started trying to learn it, and it's beautiful.''' ,'''One thing that I struggled with was not corpsing when you're being thrown stuff that's absolutely hilarious by the other actors.''' ,'''I was sometimes a bit lonely as a teenager. There was a cultural disconnect.''' ,'''When I was 14, I bought myself a cheap electric guitar and tried to teach myself.''' ,'''I keep a notebook of ideas, and sometimes ideas form in your head that you just have to write down, or you'll forget them.''' ,'''When it comes to period stuff, I think it's great to see South-Asian actors get their foot in the door there, because it's nice to tell period stories and tell it in a way that reflects the world now.''' ,'''Where do I fit in? That's something I think about as an actor, especially as an actor from a minority community.''' ,'''Sometimes on a soap, it can become about all this other stuff - the party circuit, reality shows - but I gravitated towards people who kept it all about the work.''' ,'''I think an office is just a microcosm of life and the different kinds of people that you will come across and interactions there, and I think if you all sit in a room together, then it gets a bit more intense and fun for people to watch, maybe.''' ,'''I personally am going to look for stuff that interests me and either has very little to do or has the right thing to do with my ethnicity.''' ,'''When I was on 'EastEnders,' I still had a paper route until I was 21 and left home.''' ,'''My mom's favorite song ever is 'Imagine' because it came out around when she arrived in England.''' ,'''The Beatles kind of pervade everything. They're always kind of part of everyone's lives.''' ,'''In my essay for 'The Good Immigrant,' I write about how concerns about race and immigration crept up on me a bit because of how I grew up and my background - I was quite fortunate, really; I never got the rough end of the stick with a lot of that kind of stuff.''' ,'''I'm probably one of the few people who can say that I've played an empty Wembley Stadium.''' ,'''For the last few years, I've enjoyed writing my own stuff since studying creative writing at school, and as I've grown up, I've realised how much I enjoy escaping into a world that I've created myself. So I've kept that up as a hobby.''' ,'''I think sometimes you can think up a story, but it's because you're comfortable doing that, but when you're an actor, one of the things that you have to do is take yourself out of your comfort zone.''' ,]
