quotes = ['''Most of the time, I can't listen to the song after the video's done. Sometimes I'll hear a song that I've worked on at a restaurant or on the radio, and I'll have this visceral physical reaction.''' ,'''In the case of, like, Childish Gambino, he is someone who is a writer by trade, so he is very meticulous about how he writes his ideas. I don't do this with a lot of artist, but he would give me a treatment that he wants to do, and I'll go off that; then I'll give him feedback and pitch him my ideas.''' ,'''Pilots are tricky because there are so many things you have to accomplish.''' ,'''A TV show has to be a certain length and, you know, you have expectations from the viewers. You know, you want to see the characters again, or you want to see certain dynamics between the characters or certain kinds of storylines. And you kind of figure out how to best fit what you want to say into that format.''' ,'''I just got a Filmstruck account so I can watch all of those Criterion movies streaming. I've been nerding out about that.''' ,'''I've loved music all my life.''' ,'''I used to be terrified of heights as a kid.''' ,''''Guava Island' is the end result of four incredible weeks spent in Cuba with some of the most inspiring creative talents I've ever met.''' ,'''A lot of people who make films in my generation have the vocabulary of all the films they've seen before.''' ,'''Part of the fun is finding out how elastic that box is and, you know, test the limits of what TV shows can do or what a music video can do.''' ,'''I think music videos in particular and film in general - it's really good at communicating tone and feeling.''' ,'''The weird thing about having an alligator on set is that you can't be in the direct line of sight, or they might start charging at you.''' ,'''Regularly in music videos, I'll write the pitch and convince the artists that this is a good idea, and then I'm having to make concessions to meet in the middle.''' ,'''I've always preferred being behind the camera.''' ,'''If I were FX, I wouldn't have hired me.''' ,'''I usually work in music videos, where we shoot, like, 10 to 12 setups and 60 shots or something.''' ,'''The most difficult thing about music videos is that a lot of young filmmakers come into the medium, and they have so many different ideas, but they need to understand what the musician wants.''' ,'''FX is a network; that's their whole model, letting creators make the thing they want to make and then marketing it really well.''' ,'''I just want to do things on my own terms as much as possible.''' ,'''I did a short film with Donald Glover for one of his Childish Gambino projects, and Flying Lotus was an actor in it.''' ,'''TV is generally an unfriendly environment for directors because you're expected to come in and tell a story in the voice of the show that already exists and just fill in the blanks and then submit it back.''' ,'''I've never been robbed in person, but I've gotten my car broken into a couple of times.''' ,'''I like absurdist aesthetics. There's something about dream logic that's really fascinating, how it interweaves with narrative.''' ,'''I'll listen to a song so much that ideas start to form out of daydreaming. It's as if I'm reverse-scoring the track and building visuals around a specific beat or riff that's grabbed me.''' ,'''I'm an immigrant, and I think being an outsider in your home is something that I really relate to.''' ,'''Two things - one is obvious: always keep making. The second thing, with regard to music videos specifically - the music video industry can be a place that takes advantage of young freelancers and filmmakers. Make sure you're making stuff that you're proud of and you can get behind.''' ,'''For me, I don't have a grand vision planned or an end goal. I'm just exploring what's given to me at any given moment.''' ,'''It might sound naive, but for me, you know, for me, the important part is kind of making process. So I'm not super result oriented, and I just, like, kind of getting lost in the process of making something.''' ,'''Your understanding of culture can be very skewed sometimes, depending on what you're taking in!''' ,'''I grew up listening to hip hop and embracing black culture, probably because it was 'outsider art.'''' ,'''I like shooting locations just because too much control on the stage can be a bad thing.''' ,'''Once you go outside of Atlanta, there are still a lot of Klan rallies and whatnot. There are a lot of conflicting elements that are trying to solve itself in that city.''' ,'''I got into film school thinking I was going to make features, like every other film geek.''' ,'''Music videos were an outlet.

It felt like it was a lot of responsibility.''' ,'''In a lot of comedy shows, there's a safety net where you don't assume anything of real consequence will happen.''' ,'''I think a season of 'Atlanta' bounces back between classic sitcom structure and genre movies.''' ,'''When we were making 'Teddy Perkins,' we were playing with a lot of horror tropes and things you might've seen in movies before, but we get the ability to subvert expectations or get a comedic element out of a horror moment.''' ,'''Whether it's a TV show or a music video, the seed of the idea is what's driving my decisions, not the format or the outcome.''' ,'''In Japan, animation is a big part of your media diet. I moved out to Los Angeles at 9, and when I got homesick, I would watch anime.''' ,'''I thought there was a way of marrying what I wanted to do with filmmaking with pop videos, which I found out through a couple projects just wasn't possible. That's not saying anything about the artist. If you're making an Usher video, you're making an Usher video, not a film with an Usher song in it.''' ,'''I like stories where it feels like you're only seeing a small window of a bigger world.''' ,''''Twin Peaks' was my gateway for David Lynch.''' ,'''Some people draw a line between music videos and short films, looking down on music videos as a format, but there's so much potential in music videos.''' ,'''A lot of my personality and my affinity for certain pieces of pop culture and art all stem from a sort of Japanese aesthetic and way of thinking.''' ,'''That feeling of wavering between reality and supernatural has always been really interesting to me.''' ,'''It's something that I've always been attracted to, that idea of letting everything happen in a single frame.''' ,'''As an Asian guy, I would love to see a big blockbuster with Asian lead characters.''' ,''''Atlanta' is Wild West-y - every corner of the city is trying to get by under its own rules.

They just start to become surreal, little by little. That exact moment when you're about to realize that this might be a dream is my favorite thing.''' ,'''Whenever you're making something, you're hoping that it connects with somebody in some big way, but I'd have to be crazy to expect that.''' ,'''I'm a firm believer in the idea that once we make a thing and release it, my turn to talk is done. Ideally, you're saying everything you want to say in the product you're making, and you don't have to add commentary to it afterwards.''' ,'''I'm one of those people who keep a dream journal.''' ,''''Atlanta' changes genres a lot per episode.''' ,'''I love David Lynch movies, and I like Haruki Murakami books.''' ,'''Even if an episode is self-contained, the preceding episodes always affect how the audience takes it in.''' ,]
