- I'm very lucky, as I've never ever felt any pressure from any producer to lose weight, whereas a lot of actresses have.
- You'll always end up filling out a character. It might be with aspects of yourself.
- 'The Borgias' is quite good because it does stick quite steadfastly to historical fact, so a lot of people who are interested in the historical element will love watching it, but they were also a ridiculously dramatic family.

- As much as I'd love to be a successful actor, the thought of being recognised in the street is petrifying.
- I enjoy flitting around between hair colours. I find it fascinating when people think I'm naturally blonde, as I've only been blonde for about two seconds. People pay more attention to you as a blonde; it's also easier for people to assume you're a ditsy young actress. Of course, I am a ditsy young actress - well, maybe not ditsy.

- Jack Thorne writes so well for messed-up teenage girls.
- I don't really have any strategy for my career.
- I've got a massive actor girl crush on Carey Mulligan, so I'd love to be buddies with her. She just oozes this joyful, natural innocence and always brings a nice emotional depth to her character.
- I auditioned for a musical, and I can't sing. It was a kid's film musical, not a stage show, so I thought I could get away with it.
- I'd like to continue acting as long as I enjoy it.
- Long scenes of emotion are quite difficult - you've got to build up to them and make sure you're in the right emotional space.
- I was so tiny when my parents split up that I can't remember them ever being together. That was never an issue, as I guess I never went through the trauma of them splitting up.
