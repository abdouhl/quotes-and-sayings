quotes = ['''I think, the young people in the U.K., it's a vicious cycle of not feeling empowered to do anything within their community.''' ,'''I always thought when I left medicine it would just be a one-year timeout and I'd go back, but that's now turned into many more.''' ,'''It's almost an impossible task to sum up all the things my parents have taught me over the years. Whether it was how to tie my shoelaces or encouragement in whatever career choice I wanted to pursue, they have both always been there to support me.''' ,'''I trained very hard to get into medicine, so I won't say I'll never go back to it.''' ,'''Spending time in different areas of a business and making time to understand how everyone fits together is incredibly beneficial.''' ,'''I'm not a big cryer.''' ,'''I always knew I wanted to be a doctor. I saw a lot of my friends having a hard time figuring out what they wanted to do, so I'm glad I had a purpose and goal to focus on. I liked the discipline and the sense of structure.''' ,'''Dad was always working in the living room. There was no distinction between work and life - it was the same thing.''' ,'''I'm an Apple-mad person. The iPad is now such a big part of my life.''' ,'''I have been lucky to meet some incredible people who do not possess what you would traditionally class as power, but through their charisma, passion, and strength of character, they are able to achieve things that 'richer or more powerful people' could only dream of.''' ,'''I don't think there will ever come a time that I can't learn from my parents, but there's something wonderful about getting to the age where you can role-reverse and share exciting and interesting things that you have learnt, too - even better when it's a shared passion.''' ,'''Yes, my parents brought us up like anybody else. We didn't get any more presents than other people.''' ,'''I was really lucky because from a very young age, I wanted to be a doctor. So I kinda knew I had that goal for my whole life.''' ,'''We'd have Mick Jagger round for tea one morning or Janet Jackson wandering in, but I wouldn't have been aware of it. I didn't have a clue who anyone was. They were just dad's friends popping in.''' ,'''All businesses should have an element of social enterprise, and all social enterprises should not ignore the most important lessons from successful commercial businesses.''' ,'''Just imagine how different the world could be if we all spoke to everyone with respect and kindness.''' ,'''I like to be busy every day.''' ,'''I want to make sure that when I walk down the aisle, I can see all my best friends, and I want to see their faces smiling back at me and not any random people.''' ,'''Most families like to spend time bonding over meals out, picnics in the country, maybe weekend camping trips - we take things to the extreme!''' ,'''Financial reward is important, but it shouldn't be your end goal - you'll reach your dreams much sooner if you focus your efforts on more important things.''' ,'''The Olympics was something amazing for the U.K. in bringing people together and giving the population hope.''' ,'''When I brought my medical school friends home, Dad used to tell us that we didn't know anything about the world. He started giving me impromptu quizzes about history and current events. I quite liked that.''' ,'''Our community system is completely broken down, and you need to build that back up again and make people feel that they can make a change in life and not just sit around playing video games or on their iPhones - that they can get out there and make a difference.''' ,'''When I was younger, I went with a friend of mine to Nairobi for 3 months and helped teach in an orphanage's school. It was a great experience and made me truly understand that giving back - by giving time, not just money - was so rewarding.''' ,'''My mom is seriously down to earth.''' ,'''Opportunities come in all shapes and sizes but, more importantly, make way for us to make good decisions that have a roll-on effect for others.''' ,'''We've grown up watching Dad setting and breaking records - my brother Sam was born when Dad was halfway across the Atlantic, going after a record.''' ,'''The first We Day celebration I attended was in Vancouver, and it was the most incredible experience - there is nothing more invigorating than a buzzing room of young people who are excited to change the world.''' ,'''I'd be bored just going to parties and getting my picture taken.''' ,'''From a young age, watching my father embark on daring, and often dangerous, adventures in the name of Virgin almost become the norm. I'm not saying it became any less nerve-wracking waiting for his safe return - but, over time, it encouraged a new way of thinking for myself and my brother Sam.''' ,'''I'd be a really boring person to have cameras around all day.''' ,'''I'm usually quite good at learning things, but I just don't find the business stuff that interesting, so it makes it harder to get my head around.''' ,'''I don't really enjoy finance and accounting.''' ,'''Businesses should encourage all their staff to come up with ideas, not be afraid to make suggestions, and then to act on those suggestions. There is nothing worse than going to a job every day were you feel like you are not making a difference to either the place you work or the world you live in.''' ,'''The men in my family are the big criers.''' ,'''Our parents are the most invaluable teachers we have, and no matter how alien it might seem to ask them to enter your 'work' world, you might just be surprised what comes out of it.''' ,'''We learned not to let the fear of failure stop us from attempting to fulfil our dreams - whether that dream involved a change in career, attempting to set world records, or helping young people.''' ,]
