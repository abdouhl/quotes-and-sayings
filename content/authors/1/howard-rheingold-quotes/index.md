It will be between the know-hows and the non-know-hows.''' ,'''We like technology because we don't have to talk to anybody.''' ,'''Inexpensive phones and pay-as-you go services are already spreading mobile phone technology to many parts of that world that never had a wired infrastructure.''' ,'''When designers replaced the command line interface with the graphical user interface, billions of people who are not programmers could make use of computer technology.''' ,'''Any disease support community is a place of deep bonds and empathy, and there are thousands if not tens of thousands of them.''' ,'''Schoolchildren are not taught how to distinguish accurate information from inaccurate information online - surely there are ways to design web-browsers to help with this task and ways to teach young people how to use the powerful online tools available to them.''' ,'''As for Twitter, I've found that you have to learn how to make it add value rather than subtract hours from one's day. Certainly, it affords narcissism and distraction.''' ,'''People's behavior will change with technology. I know very few young people who can't type out a text message on their phone with one thumb, for instance.''' ,'''Democracy is not just voting for your leaders; it's really premised upon ordinary citizens understanding the issues.''' ,'''Some digital natives are extraordinarily savvy.''' ,'''You can't assume any place you go is private because the means of surveillance are becoming so affordable and so invisible.''' ,'''Its not a global village, but we're in a highly interconnected globe.''' ,'''It used to be that if your automobile broke, the teenager down the street with the wrench could fix it. Now you have to have sophisticated equipment that can deal with microchips. We're entering a world in which the complexity of the devices and the system of interconnecting devices is beyond our capability to easily understand.''' ,'''One thing we didn't know in 1996 is that it's very, very difficult, if not impossible, to sustain a culture with online advertising.''' ,'''There is an elementary level of trust that is necessary for community.

The other is location awareness, so that devices we carry around know where we are. When you combine those two, you get a lot of possibilities.''' ,'''Communicating online goes back to the Defense Department's Arpanet which started in 1969.

And it was the administers of these empires who began hiring people to keep track of the wheat and sheep and wine that was owed and the taxes that was owed on them by making marks; marks on clay in that time.''' ,'''The Orwellian vision was about state-sponsored surveillance.
