quotes = ['''Managers are obsessed with the game. It's very, very difficult, if not impossible, to live a balanced lifestyle.''' ,'''You can go to the pictures or read a book, but football constantly comes back into your mind. It's not a job, it's a life. It takes up your time, thoughts and energy and it can damage relationships with those around you.''' ,'''I am a firm believer that if you score one goal the other team have to score two to win.''' ,'''The chairmen of the largest companies in the world can cancel an appointment or move a board meeting; a manager cannot change the date of a game. In the combined 42 years that Sir Alex Ferguson and Arsene Wenger have managed in English football, I can only remember one occasion when Sir Alex did not attend a Manchester United game.''' ,'''If they hadn't scored, we would've won.''' ,'''Gary Speed was honourable, trustworthy and a joy to manage.
