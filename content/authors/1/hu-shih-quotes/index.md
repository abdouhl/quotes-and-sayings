Our first great philosopher was a founder of naturalism; and our second great philosopher was an agnostic.''' ,'''On the basis of biological, sociological, and historical knowledge, we should recognize that the individual self is subject to death or decay, but the sum total of individual achievement, for better or worse, lives on in the immortality of The Larger.''' ,'''But I wish to point out that it is entirely wrong to say that the Chinese are not religious.''' ,'''The Jesuits had learned that a Christian mission to China could never succeed if it were not in a position to show and convince the Chinese intelligentsia of the superiority of the European culture.''' ,'''Confucius was a humanist and an agnostic.''' ,'''On July 26, 1916, I announced to all my friends in America that from now on I resolved to write no more poems in the classical language, and to begin my experiments in writing poetry in the so-called vulgar tongue of the people.''' ,'''It is only through contact and comparison that the relative value or worthlessness of the various cultural elements can be clearly and critically seen and understood.''' ,'''What is sacred among one people may be ridiculous in another; and what is despised or rejected by one cultural group, may in a different environment become the cornerstone for a great edifice of strange grandeur and beauty.''' ,'''Historically, there had been many periods of Chinese Renaissance.''' ,'''It is true that the Chinese are not so religious as the Hindus, or even as the Japanese; and they are certainly not so religious as the Christian missionaries desire them to be.''' ,'''In such diffused changes of culture two factors are necessary: contact and understanding.''' ,'''India Conquered and dominated China culturally for 20 centuries without ever having to send a single soldier across her border.''' ,'''Life and human society are the chief concern of Confucianism and, through it, the chief concern of the Chinese people.''' ,]
