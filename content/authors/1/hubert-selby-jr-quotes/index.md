- One of the things I have become aware of through the years is how much I love the people I write about.
- I have rituals for cleaning out resentments, disappointments, heartbreak, depression and for work. One of the things I do is go over old stuff if I have been unable to write for a while.
- I guess it could be said that the inspiration for 'Requiem for a Dream' is watching the American dream not only destroy so many lives in the U.S., but infect the rest of the world with its obsession with getting more, ignoring the deadly effect that has on the planet.
- There are a lot of people in this country who really like my writing. And a lot of writers respect me. But the so-called establishment? They hate me.
- I've always felt alienated. I realized that I've been terrified my entire life. So I can identify that fear which drives so many of the people that I write about.
- My writing is inspired by just about everything, yet I am unaware of so much of the process.
