quotes = ['''America has a critical place to play in the end of extreme poverty.''' ,'''History shows that all protest movements rely on symbols - boycotts, strikes, sit-ins, flags, songs. Symbolic action on whatever scale - from the Montgomery Bus Boycott to wearing a simple wristband - is designed to disrupt our everyday complacency and force people to think.''' ,'''The Global Poverty Project's mission is to stand up for the world's poorest people. We fight for the full funding of Millennium Development Goals and advocate meaningful change to government and corporate policies that block progress and entrench injustice.''' ,'''Global poverty is the product of reversible policy failures overseen by politicians, past and present.
