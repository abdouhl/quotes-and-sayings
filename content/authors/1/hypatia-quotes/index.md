quotes = ['''Fables should be taught as fables, myths as myths, and miracles as poetic fantasies. To teach superstitions as truths is a most terrible thing. The child mind accepts and believes them, and only through great pain and perhaps tragedy can he be in after years relieved of them.''' ,'''Life is an unfoldment, and the further we travel the more truth we can comprehend. To understand the things that are at our door is the best preparation for understanding those that lie beyond.''' ,'''All formal dogmatic religions are fallacious and must never be accepted by self-respecting persons as final.''' ,'''Reserve your right to think, for even to think wrongly is better than not to think at all.''' ,'''In fact men will fight for a superstition quite as quickly as for a living truth - often more so, since a superstition is so intangible you cannot get at it to refute it, but truth is a point of view, and so is changeable.''' ,]
