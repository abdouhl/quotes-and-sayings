- Pakistan is a free country, so according to me, in a free country, it's every right of the citizen to live the way they wish.
- I want to give my followers a positive message. I want to give those girls a positive message who have been forcefully married, who continue to sacrifice. I want to be an example for those people. That's my aim.
- There was a time my parents never listened to me. They wouldn't have forced me into marriage had they heard me out. But now, they support me.
- My work is entertainment, and I look at what entertains people, whether it's a selfie video or a music video.
- I did a job. I completed my Matric and my Bachelors. I did a marketing job. I worked as a bus hostess. I did a lot of jobs; I struggled a lot. I got out from there. The first thing I did when I got out of Darul Aman was my Matric. Then I did my Bachelors privately; I kept doing it.
- I have already applied to the Home Ministry for security. So far, I have got nothing. For security, I am staying underground.
- At least international media can see how I am trying to change the typical orthodox mindset of people who don't want to come out of their shells of false beliefs and old practices.
- I don't know how many girls have felt support through my persona. I'm a girl power. So many girls tell me I'm a girl power, and yes, I am.
- I have no interest that I go to India or go to Hollywood or Bollywood. I'm not interested. I am a social media sensation. This is what I like.
- I am facing threats. But I believe that death is preordained - when you are meant to die, you will die.
- It's time to bring a change because the world is changing. Let's open our minds and live in present.
- My aim is to change the social norms of Pakistan; women here look up to me. I started very early, worked on myself, and the effect is for all to see.
- It was about 2012, 2013. I started from zero. Small fashion shows, small photoshoots. I've seen a lot. I've seen a lot of things up close. I married my sister off; I gave jahez for her wedding. I tried to keep relations going with my family. I bought a house for them in Multan. My parents are settled in Multan; my house is there.
- I want to create a platform for those people who want to come to this field. These people will face hurdles and problems that don't allow them to show their talent. So I want to make a platform that they can easily access, and then, at least, they won't be a victim of these problems.
- Media is not supporting me. They're saying that I want to marry Imran Khan, but I'm already married. This is wrong. What about my self-worth? My identity? I am a social media sensation. I am a fashion icon.
- Nothing is good in this society. This patriarchal society is bad.
- It was my wish since I was a child to become something, to be able to stand on my own two feet, to do something for myself.
- I've fought with everyone . And now I have become so headstrong that I only do what I want.
- I tried it, but frankly, I don't know how to twerk.
- Many said I am not a Baloch and I have nothing to do with the community; in general, the feeling is that I am doing everything to bring shame to Pakistan. But I will not stop.
- I am not hungry for roles on TV or in films. I am happy being a social media sensation.
- What do you think will happen in a forced marriage? With an uneducated man, an animal. What would I say, that I am already married? Why would I say it? I never accepted him as my husband in my heart or mind. How I spent a year and a half with him, only I know. And I only did it because of the child.
- Love me or hate me, both are in my favour. If you love me, I will always be in your heart, and if you hate me, I will be in your mind.
- I was 17 when I was forced into marriage. I had no hand in it, and I didn't even enjoy being with the man. Also, I wanted to study, but no one listened to me. I wanted to move forward in life, it wasn't a happy situation. Because of some family problems, I had to stick around.
- Please don't compare me with Taher Shah. He is a joker, while I am an artiste - I am a model and an actress. Taher Shah comes, makes people laugh, and goes away. I work with a lot of honesty.
