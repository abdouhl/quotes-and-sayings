- I wanted to be a painter, somewhere between Abstract Expressionism and Pop.
- I'm not sure how to describe my style. A lot of my work is dark and looks a bit sad, which is strange because I'm such a smiley, over-the-top positive guy who wears gold shoes most days.
- I want to tell you what it was really like to think death is imminent, but I can't. It's a taste in your mouth. And an emptiness.
- Your belief system saturates the space around you.
- Make your work deeper and better than those before you, and eventually someone will notice. If you don't think the work is better than what you've seen, then go back until it is.
- Men are separated by so many petty things.
- I don't want to do stories that don't have a heart. I'm just not going to be satisfied with stories where I can't be passionate about the subject, where I can't make a difference.
- A visual understanding of great composition and how to use a camera and expensive lenses can be learned, but drive and a real hunger for making photos and telling stories... I don't think that part can be learned. You either have that inside, or you don't.
- War is the greatest failure of mankind.
- War is death. If we are to engage in war, then we should have to stare it straight in the face and call it by its rightful name.
