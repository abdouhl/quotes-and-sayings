- I have a wonderful English-language dialogue coach. All the time I have to speak English, he is with me. It is a double effort, because you have to say the words correctly and then act them.
- In Mexico, there are good filmmakers, but they didn't always have the opportunity to show their work. But since 'Amores Perros,' many of these filmmakers had the opportunity to show their films, and they have a newfound energy for cinema.
