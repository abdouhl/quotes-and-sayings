- It is so inspiring when you come across a woman who is very strong and dedicated and is amazing at what they do. That's how I feel about Meryl Streep. You watch her, and you can't help but notice all of that about her. She's so influential.
- I don't really go to fashion parties; they're not my scene.
- I dress like a tomboy.
- I think modelling was like the university of life, really. You get to travel but you get thrown into this adult world, which is kind of quite scary.
- I never knew modelling was what I wanted to do. I was just meandering through life having fun, having a laugh with my friends.
- I don't have that many friends.
- Well, I suppose I've never really had a lifestyle that needs upkeep. I don't get cabs; I'm on the Tube with my Oyster card.
- I want to play positive role models - women who mean something to other women.
- The fact is I'm choosy, but mainly about a man's character. He has to be interesting, funny and clever. I don't even mind if he's not very good-looking.
- A lot of stuff written about me is rubbish. I don't know where they get it from, sometimes.
- My mum used to always dress me and my sister in matching Laura Ashley dresses. And I'd be like, 'Mum, I just wanna wear my Doc Martens!'
- I'd like a relationship that was like two tree trunks side by side, strong but independent.

- I don't really see myself as a big supermodel.
- When you're young, you say it how it is, and even your views are, like, 'This is totally the truth', 'cos you don't know any difference, so there's a real confidence in your way of thinking.
- For modelling, you have to be such a strong person in a way - or seen to be a strong person, do you know what I mean? But in acting you have to get in touch with all the vulnerability that you carry.
- I don't think a name defines the core of who you are.
- I know I'm no Whitney Houston.
- I love 'Breathless,' and 'Paris, Texas,' and 'Badlands.' I was obsessed with those films in my teens. I remember watching 'Badlands' and being amazed that there were these scenes in which nobody said anything and the silence told the whole story.
- I don't expect that because I was successful in one field that I will then get a ride of passage into another.
- Modelling is only about the look. In acting, it's the feel that matters.
- Not just in modeling, but in society, there's so much pressure about what a woman should be, and, of course, it's just so unobtainable. You can never become that thing, because it's such a projection.
- I've always got on with lads, more than I have with girls.
- When I first started modelling, as I was walking down the catwalk I just thought, 'Please don't fall over, please don't fall over, please don't fall over!'
- I've never had formal drama-school training; I've just picked things up as I've gone along.
- I'm not the new anything; I'm just Agyness.
- If you have a connection to someone, it doesn't matter what their exterior is.
