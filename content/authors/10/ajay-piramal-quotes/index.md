Does it mean that we are looking out to monetise the investment? That is not correct. But if we get an offer that we cannot refuse, as I say, then it is not that we are not, that we will still hold on to the investment.''' ,'''Don't hoard your wealth. Instead, live the life you want with the wealth you have been blessed with, but also make it beneficial for the good of the larger community.''' ,'''It is very clear for us; we will do whatever is in the best interest of Shriram shareholders.''' ,'''You cannot have the financial system crippled because of lack of decision making and lack of quality people.''' ,'''The Internet can bring us much closer to the developed world.''' ,'''Many people say that in a liberalised world there is little for the government to do, but the fact is that there is much for the government to do in fewer areas.

Integrity is also critical to leadership, so I believe there must always be alignment between what you think, say, and do.''' ,'''Innovation means taking risks, and that is where the private sector can play a role.''' ,'''I have always said that you have to fail. If you do not fail, it means you have never taken enough risks.''' ,'''Normally, Indian companies follow the trend set by companies abroad.

This was also not a consideration when we decided to invest in Shriram Group.''' ,'''Textile mills are not a very high-margin business and have fixed overheads, so it was challenging. But I think it is only in challenges that you get opportunities.''' ,'''Life looked bleak when I became chairman of the group at the age of 29.
