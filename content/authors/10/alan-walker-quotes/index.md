- I actually admire the Indian artiste 'Lost Stories.' He made a remix of my song 'Faded.' That is really good and cool because it actually represented Indian music. I just loved the song; it so unique.
- Later on, when I signed with Sony, we wanted to re-release 'Fade' as 'Faded' with a brand new mix and with vocals by Iselin Solheim. I think Iselin was the first person who sung demo vocals for 'Faded.' And it worked out great! The way I got in touch with Iselin was through a guy that I work with in the studio.
- I like anything that is melodic, and I'm a very big fan of movie soundtracks, so my favorite artists/producers would be Steve Jablonsky, Hans Zimmer, K-391, Ahrix, KSHMR, and many, many more.
- I chose 'Time' by Hans Zimmer because it's very melodic, and the way it progresses throughout the track is very unique. I am personally a very big fan of piano melodies, and to me, 'Time' is just perfect.
- My journey began when I found out about YouTube on how do you make music, and from that, people started explaining me how I had to do it.
- Lensko is a friend of mine with a great talent! The way he progresses his tracks is so unique, just the way he puts everything together is so different from what I usually hear nowadays in the EDM-world.
- There are always going to be haters.
- Graphic design is a hobby that I started with back in 2010-2011, which I am still doing today. And because of that, I was able to design my own stuff and designed my own logo.
- I keep my face covered during concerts. That's just something that is part of me, an artist, and I think it's a cool concept and look. It is really inspired by my love for video games, especially with the videogame 'Watchdog' that I love.
- 'Nova' was one of the tracks that inspired me to create 'Fade,' which later became 'Faded'. It has a beautiful melody, and the way it progresses throughout the whole track is just amazing!
- I had no interest in music. But now, music means everything to me. I have no words to explain how beautiful music is. It is where you can create everything, like beautiful songs to sad songs to almost anything.
- I want to enjoy not getting recognised while it lasts. But the mask is a symbol of unity. Anyone can be a Walker.
