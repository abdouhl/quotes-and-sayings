- Drag queens are extremely innovative and, I mean, we will persist through plague, famine, war or pandemic. We will prevail.
- I was like, 18 and it was in West Virginia because I was allowed to get into the clubs in West Virginia, not Pennsylvania where I was growing up. And we went in and there was a drag queen on stage and she was huge and beautiful, but she was lip syncing to a song. I was legitimately stunned.

So we're lucky it is just a lighthearted Christmas tune.
- It was horrible having to watch myself on TV. I think I would have had a much better time if I didn't take it so seriously.
- Pittsburgh's definitely the city where I learned how to be on a stage, hold a microphone, and interact with an audience. It's where I got my chops as an entertainer and as a performer, so I'm grateful to the queer community there because they are active and vocal and they care about each other.
- I like to take whatever work opportunities I can. I like to work with as many people as I can. I like to show up on time, and I like to have a good time.
