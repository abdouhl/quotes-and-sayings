quotes = ['''I don't really feel an allegiance to any of the countries I have lived in, even though I feel like part of them, and part of them is in me.''' ,'''On a personal level, I don't exactly thrive on the idea of being known as the guy who goes topless - because I also took my shirt off on 'American Horror Story: Coven' - but I think in 'The Last Kingdom,' it's mainly done in the right way.''' ,'''I used to feel I was more French than anything, but I don't feel that way anymore. I really don't feel like I belong to a specific country, and it is so difficult for people to understand that.''' ,'''I loved Bernard Cornwell's books.''' ,'''As a child, it was really hard because I'd be thrown into a new school and have to make new friends, or I'd sit in class for months without speaking the language, but as I got older, I welcomed the possibility of discovering new cultures and languages.''' ,'''It's normal when there's a new show on the air to say this is the new 'Game of Thrones' or this is the new 'Vikings,' because we need to put things in boxes.''' ,'''I have a lot of cousins that I'm very close to.''' ,'''No amount of success is worth it to me if I can't share it with someone I love.''' ,'''I found that the nicer and more helpful I was to people I worked with, whether I was 'somebody' or 'nobody' on set, the more fun I had.''' ,'''There's never enough time to shoot battle scenes or fight scenes. It always feels rushed. Anytime horses are involved, it eats up time like crazy.''' ,'''I did have an imaginary girlfriend.''' ,'''The funny thing about acting is, there's no 'right' way to make it. Some people need to work their butts off, and some don't. They're just naturals. I wasn't a natural. I sucked.''' ,'''We know they took their look very seriously - tweezers and combs were found in Viking graves. The warriors would file their teeth down to make them pointy, use kohl to make their eyes look darker, and red pigment on their teeth to make them look bloody.''' ,'''Who wants to watch a series without humour?''' ,'''I have a large family with lots of little kids.''' ,'''If 'Game Of Thrones' hadn't been made, I don't think 'The Last Kingdom' would have been, but this is more grounded in real life.''' ,'''I had a lot of older friends when I was a kid, from sort of all walks of life, and that's still the way it is.''' ,''''The Last Kingdom''s got its roots in history, and it's a lot grittier. It doesn't have the 'Game of Thrones' gloss.''' ,'''My mom was a history teacher when I was a kid, so I hated history out of rebellion.''' ,'''I was in love with a girl in my class when I was in primary school, and she obviously thought I was a freak, so that wasn't working out. And the the guys in my class, every two weeks they'd say, 'Hey, we spoke to her, and she really likes you now. You should go and ask her again.' And then I'd go and ask her again.''' ,'''I grew up a little bit in Germany and then in Switzerland, then in France, the United States and in England, and so it is weird.''' ,'''I have done martial arts my whole life, so it comes easily, but I have never done proper sword fighting.''' ,'''I believe that my greatest strength is a deep-rooted, unshakeable trust to never let myself give up.''' ,'''I always stretch after working out or training and then again before going to sleep. It keeps the muscles healthy and useful, reduces risk of injuries, and is a great way to wind down.''' ,'''Every actor strives to be in the moment, and when you're on a horse, you constantly have to communicate with it and assert your authority.''' ,'''There are definitely advantages to not looking like a Viking in real life.''' ,'''People who are creating history don't realize they're creating it at the time it's happening.''' ,'''I love generally being out in nature. It is just so amazing.''' ,]
