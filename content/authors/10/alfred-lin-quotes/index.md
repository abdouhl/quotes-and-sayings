quotes = ['''I think if companies start reinventing themselves and focus on the customer experience more, they will win out in the end.''' ,'''I wanted to be a venture capitalist and join Sequoia Capital. They've financed and helped built some really special and enormously successful companies, including Google, Yahoo, Paypal, YouTube, Cisco, Oracle, Apple, and also Zappos.''' ,'''It's harder than ever to build an enduring company. As soon as a product strikes a nerve with customers, competitors emerge globally because the costs to start are so low.''' ,'''It would be great if companies could just magically know what I'm looking for on their website or what I'm coming to the website for.''' ,'''Businesses are not just local or even national anymore - good ideas are immediately global. So the market opportunities are much larger than we've ever imagined or seen.''' ,'''As an immigrant, my wish is that we fix immigration. At Sequoia, we've backed a number of exceptional founders that were born abroad but started their careers in the Valley.
