- Well, I'm always working on my comic strip and trying to, you know, keep cranking that out.
- But mostly, it's a book about my relationship with my father.
- Sometimes I wish the writing and drawing were more integrated.
- I'm pretty illiterate when it comes to comics history.
- Watching everyone root through their psyche, it just delights me. Especially R. Crumb's stuff.
- Autobiographical comics, I love them. I love them.
- For some reason writing and drawing are very separate processes for me.
- Writing this book feels like a completely different activity from writing my comic strip because it's about real life. I feel like I'm using a part of my brain that's been dormant until now.
- Yeah, I read Judy Blume. My mother didn't like that, but I read it anyhow.
- Partly I resented being perceived as weak because I was a girl.
- That's all true, but there was something else going on for me as a kid, something about my gender identity that I haven't figured out yet. And that's one of the things I'm hoping to dissect and investigate in this memoir project.
- I get a lot of mail from men who really identify with Stuart, you know, Sparrow's boyfriend. I love that. Even though I used to say I wanted men to read the strip even though there weren't any men in it, so they'd be forced to identify with the women.
- Even drawing gray hair at all is difficult to render in black and white.
- And partly, the worst thing you could do in my family was need something from someone. So physical strength represented an avenue of self-sufficiency to me.
- Mostly it was Mad magazine. And I did read a lot of - I had a subscription when I was little, but I also had access to some old collections, the little paperbacks of the really good stuff.
- I never really read superhero stuff as a kid.
- The satiric ethos of Mad was a much bigger childhood influence.
- One of them is already having some menopausal symptoms. I'm working on that. I'm giving them all little lines under the eyes, trying to sort of make them age gracefully.
- I don't know, maybe it's because I was raised Catholic. Confession has always held a great appeal for me.
- I hope that I can get people to read it without having to change it. Especially now that the strip has more different kinds of characters. It's really not all lesbians any more.
- It's a hard thing to age a character because you can't really suddenly give someone gray hair.
- My mother is, my father certainly was. They were kind of the local intelligentsia in the town where I grew up.
- I just met someone who read Gone With the Wind 62 times for exactly that same reason. She couldn't bear that it wasn't real. She wanted to live in it.
- It's definitely part of it, that the men were having fun and doing the interesting things but also, I don't know, I'm just thinking more about gender and how maybe in some way I am more of a boy than a girl.
- People really want to think that these things really happened. I don't know why that important, but I know that when I finish reading a novel or something, I want to know how much of that really happened to this author.
- When I grew up, I studied karate for years. I got pretty strong, but eventually I had to acknowledge that I really didn't like fighting at all, so I quit.
- But I read comic books. I read things like Richie Rich and Little Lulu.
- Nancy Drew was always changing her outfits. I despised girls' clothing, I couldn't wait to get home from school and get out of it. The last thing I wanted to read was minute descriptions of Nancy's frocks.
- I started to get bored with that stuff about only drawing men and I've taken it out of the slideshow.
- I probably read Harriet the Spy about 70,000 times.
- I just have this sort of entrepreneurial spirit and I work really hard at promoting myself.
- I love Jules Feiffer. I didn't discover him until I was a little older.
- When I was growing up in the 1960s, there was starting to be more books geared towards young adults.
