But I think, like everyone does as they grow older and probably wiser, I can look back at my earlier life - my history, my mistakes, the joy I felt as a young woman traveling the world - with some objectivity and even some humor.''' ,'''My faith in human decency was sorely tested at times during my captivity; however, after my release, I am humbly reminded that mankind is inherently good by the tremendous efforts and support of fellow Canadians.''' ,'''Being in the dark, there's a real weight to it. It's heavy.''' ,'''I don't only long for the thrill of being in the middle of a war, I must understand it; I must make other people understand.''' ,'''I used my captors' names every chance I had.

I want to excel. I want to speak articulately about the politics of the Middle East and its religion.''' ,'''Forgiving is not an easy thing to do.''' ,'''Every day I have many choices to make about who I want to be.''' ,'''What happened to me in Somalia doesn't define me.''' ,'''I think it's the human spirit inside of all of us that has an enormous capacity to survive.''' ,'''It's difficult to put into words what freedom feels like.

That's a lot of work, but to me it's worthwhile.''' ,'''Women in Somalia face almost unimaginable oppression.''' ,'''I have watched lives change. I have seen women gain confidence.''' ,'''My confidence came from the way I grew up, and I'm grateful for it.''' ,'''It was a slow understanding that my kidnappers really are a product of their environment.''' ,'''Somalia is an important story in the world, and it needed to be told.''' ,'''War dehumanizes everyone.''' ,'''The same men who are placing all these outrageous restrictions on women's freedoms in southern Somalia - that type of mentality - that's what I had to deal with in captivity.''' ,'''With awareness come responsibility and choice.''' ,'''Maintaining my dignity is so important for me.''' ,'''Many, including the Canadian and U.S. governments, try to provide family support while also maintaining a hard line about further fuelling terrorism and hostage-taking through ransom payments ...
