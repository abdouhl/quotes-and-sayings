- I share different relationships with all directors. I share a beautiful working relationship with Anurag Kashyap. Sriram Raghavan is such an inspiration and I have always wanted to work with them. I gel really well with filmmakers like these.
- The amount of exposure you get in India as a musician in Bollywood is so much better than what one gets independently.
- To play on top of a bus is something we've never done before - we did play on the Red Bull Tour Bus once in Bangalore last year, but it's always a one of a kind of experience to jump on the bus and sing.
- Ultimately it's just music - whether I'm catering to the Bollywood audience or the indie audience. I just approach every type of music the way I am, and how my personality is.
- I'm getting to compose music for diverse language films from all over the country.
- The pressure is only from the producers and the labels. No composer, no singer would ever want to sing a remix.
- I was listening to radio and it plays only Bollywood. This is something I hate about radio stations. There's so much other beautiful music out there.
- Bollywood is such a space where you get to work with so many genres. Genres being pushed isn't the way of looking at it. In fact, I think Indie needs to be given a lot more focus or recognition.

- Yes, because as composers we are looking for textured voices, and often the singers we find are not trained to perform in a studio environment. So we need technology to doctor their voices to suit the format.

- I am always in my space and it's a happy space. It gets stressful at times, but that's a part and parcel of our job.
- When I am composing in a studio, I cannot gauge what the audience feels. Sometimes, good songs don't get the recognition because the films fail. But when you are performing live, the reaction is immediate.
- Once you connect to a film, things flow naturally. And there are times where you don't connect with a film. In these situations, you just have to see through it. We are professionals and just have to give our best at the given circumstances.
- Ever since I started, I think Bollywood has gone through a lot of changes. Film producers now want to experiment with their movie's music and that's why you see many of them working with independent musicians.
- I'm a huge fan of Chennai - the culture, the musicians, the audience... Language is not a barrier. It is all about the emotion in the music.
- I love listening a lot and I listen to all sorts of songs, old and new. But the real inspiration has to come from within.

- I sign up whatever live shows I get simply because every gig is a chance to reach out directly to the audience. When it comes to gigs, I try mixing personal picks with what the audience demands.
- I enjoy what I do. The only burden is the deadlines. Plus, composing background scores is a thankless job; it is not perceived as a significant thing.
- For creators, especially for me as a composer, I am sure for singers also, it is sad. It is not exciting that we have to create something that someone else has already done before.

- Lyrics is the face of any song. The combination of composition, lyrics and singing is what makes a song a song.

- I do sometimes go back to my old songs. Some I feel very proud of. They make me wonder, 'How did I do this?'
- But a lot of people think I am very expensive and I charge a lot of money, which is not the case. I am open to all kinds of experimentation and work. So, people should just approach without hesitating or thinking about money!
- The only place where any artist feels liberated is doing independent music. I have had great experience making music for The Dewarists and Coke Studio. No actor, producer or label is telling me what to do with my music. I'm the boss. It is my life, my expression.
- When I look back, I remember how being a part of Bollywood was never the plan.
- My mother sang. But back in the day, it was looked down upon if the lady of the house wanted to sing in public. So, she couldn't pursue her musical aspirations.
- Most films don't have a budget for a background score, but it is the toughest job to do. We work like donkeys. And usually we get only around a month to do a score.
- I am a very ordinary singer who doesn't even do riyaz.
- I don't have any background in the industry, nobody in my family or friends. So entering into the industry and dealing with the concept of being a Bollywood music composer was daunting initially.
