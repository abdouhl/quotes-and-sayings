quotes = ['''Closing one's eyes is not a recipe for peace. It is a simple way to embolden aggressive personalities.''' ,'''If someone is undertaking aggressive military activities in Ukraine and Syria, if someone is bolstering his military presence near his neighbors... then we have an unequivocal answer regarding who wants to start a new Cold War. Certainly, it is not Poland or the NATO alliance.''' ,'''I am the president of Poland, and I will never accept Poles being insulted or humiliated or facts being distorted that hurt our dignity.''' ,'''There is a threat of Russian energy domination, especially when Russia mentions that it's going to build more pipelines - Nord Stream III, Nord Stream IV.''' ,'''What it depends on is someone's upbringing and the traditions and that is how you decide if you are Jewish or not.''' ,'''Our country vanished from the map of Europe after the attack of the Soviet Union against Poland.

Experts point out that our supplies run for another 200 years, and it would be hard not to use them.''' ,'''I'm not going to argue with scientists how much human activity affects natural environment, including climate.''' ,'''Both Poland and Canada should be advocates of long-'lasting, peaceful solutions in eastern Ukraine, based on unconditional respect of international law.''' ,'''It is not possible for any institutions to interfere in the way parents raise their children.''' ,'''Regardless of whether they voted for me or not, I would like Poles to say after those five years that I really tried to be the president of all Poles, that I tried to answer their needs, that I was such a person.''' ,'''There are Jews who were born in Poland before World War II and survived the Holocaust, who think Poland and the Poles deserve an apology.''' ,'''It is not in Poland's interest that the U.K. leaves the European Union. We think it would lead to a big crisis and even a collapse if the U.K. left.''' ,'''A lot of young Poles, very well educated ones, are living in Britain. They are working hard. Of course they are building their own prosperity, but they are also contributing to the economic prosperity of the United Kingdom and surely I can say - and this is underpinned by the economic data - they bring in more than they take away.''' ,'''Family is the future, security is the future, work is the future, investment is the future, dignity is the future.''' ,'''No one from abroad can dictate to us whether Poles are allowed to defend themselves against slandering.''' ,'''If you ask the Polish people, I believe that a vast majority of them would say they are pleased with E.U. membership, but also a majority consider very highly the sovereignty and independence of Poland - they are very attached to Polish tradition.''' ,'''Without the reform of the justice system, there is no possibility of building a just state.''' ,'''Poland is an attractive country, and first and foremost it's got a very important strategic location in Europe.''' ,'''We are still faced, even in Europe, with the return of imperialist tendencies, attempts to change borders by force, assaults on other states, taking their land, enslaving citizens.''' ,'''I'm hugely delighted with the presence of U.S. Armed Forces in the Polish territory.''' ,'''I want significant parts of Nato infrastructure, important for the alliance, to be placed in the central Europe.''' ,'''I think that as president of Poland, I can speak about the suffering.''' ,'''Distorting the history of World War II, denying the crimes of genocide and the Holocaust as well as an instrumental use of Auschwitz to attain any given goal is tantamount to desecration of the memory of the victims whose ashes are scattered here.''' ,'''I'm sorry to say this, but Putin is spreading lies.

Nobody knows, so to talk about how to recognize if someone is Jewish is ridiculous.''' ,'''We do not agree with policies that would lead to attempts at easing sanctions or lifting them and returning to business as usual with Russia.

Vaccination against coronavirus should absolutely not be mandatory.''' ,'''We continue to advocate and demand that the territorial integrity of both Ukraine and Georgia be preserved...
