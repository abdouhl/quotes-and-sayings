quotes = ['''I wouldn't want to make the same record over and over again or look the same or be the same. I think that's just human life in general, though.''' ,'''For us, all we care about is maintaining what we do as a band.''' ,'''We've won both the best and worst band in so many major magazines - we just get written off so much, but we don't care.''' ,'''I just don't really think about death.''' ,'''Lyrically, the most important thing for me is, how can I tell a cohesive story?''' ,'''The older I get, the more interest I have in writing other kinds of music.''' ,'''My biggest love has always been the music Black Veil Brides make, but that doesn't mean I don't listen to or enjoy other things.''' ,'''I came from a town of about 2,000 people with one stop light, and I was told that nothing I ever wanted to do, I would succeed in.''' ,'''We're not trying to shock people with our image.''' ,'''We made 'Wretched and Divine,' and as much as I love it, it's a pretty sparkly record - it's a record that could be done as a play because it's very theatrical with no grit.''' ,'''More than anything, I write about what I know. The experiences that I've had in my life and that we've all had collectively, that's what we draw from.''' ,'''I see the merit in religion, and I see the need for faith and hope and sometimes people who are more snide look at people who are religious, particularly people in rock bands, and they'll say, 'Oh that's dumb, you believe in whatever,' but I think everybody believes in something.''' ,'''My whole life, I've loved '80s synth and goth rock like The Sisters of Mercy and Depeche Mode.''' ,'''The story of my life publicly has been told through 'Alternative Press.' Former employees, people who have worked there - my friend Ryan Downey, who wrote for 'AP' for a long time - I've been able to have really great articles written about me and talk openly about things in my life.''' ,'''One of the things that always disappointed me as a kid, growing up, was when you could tell the singer had a fancy for something different and turned the band into something else.''' ,'''If you nominate us for something, we're going to win.''' ,'''I know what it's like to be an outcast in society. I know what it's like to want to find strength, and more importantly, I know what it's like to find that internal strength and rise out of the pain of being just sort of a weirdo.''' ,'''I go to a lot of self-help groups in the day, and then I can sleep pretty well at night.''' ,'''Growing up, I went to the Warped Tour a lot, and I got to see bands like Rancid and AFI and Dropkick Murphys and these bands that meant so much to me when I was a kid - all in succession on these stages, so to get to play that same stage that I watched those bands play is a huge thing for me.''' ,'''We're not here to make the ignorant people happy. We're here to write our music for those people that are interested in good rock n' roll music.''' ,'''If they can look past the fact that I happen to wear mascara on stage - which, by the way, is a ridiculous thing that people have a stigma about - then we promise a good rock show.''' ,'''Our music is never going to stop someone from bullying someone else. But you should be your own person.''' ,'''There is no reason why a guitar player makes the guitar-playing faces. It doesn't help you play guitar. You've not improved your skills. It's because you're up onstage, and the natural inclination is to put on a show. The rock guy faces are just as much of a front or a show as us wearing crazy makeup. It's just a different scale.''' ,'''I like both antireligious and traditional Catholic imagery.''' ,'''I will say one thing: Mick Mars is one of the greatest songwriters I've ever met in my life and had the pleasure to work with.''' ,'''I'm not religious, but I understand the need for faith and hope.''' ,'''I had Batman stuff all over my house growing up.''' ,'''Whether I'm trying to or not, I have this inherent feeling that music is uplifting; it makes you feel victorious, and that makes you feel like you can take on the world.''' ,'''I don't know what metalcore is. I know what rock n' roll is... It's not rocket science.''' ,'''I'm not against making new fans, but I'm not going to go out of my way to pander to someone and try to make them like me; that's not who we are. It's not as if we're fighting to find an audience - we have our audience, and anybody else is definitely welcome.''' ,'''A band like Avenged Sevenfold I've praised quite a bit publicly, because it's a band that has moved into that arena-size thing for a hard rock band.''' ,'''When I was a kid, it was so important to listen only to bands nobody had ever heard of. I missed out on so much interesting music because of my need to listen to a psychobilly band that only two people knew about... Because I thought I was cool.''' ,'''I have a super supportive family.''' ,'''I think, on any given day, somebody could help out a homeless person and cuss out somebody that cut them off in traffic, and I think that everybody has that inside them: it's just how you live that balance - so I think everybody is 'Wretched and Divine.'''' ,'''I think Heaven and afterlife is for the living; it's for the people that continue on and remember that person, and if you've done something that is substantial in your life then you can leave a legacy and do something positive.''' ,'''I was homeless for almost a year and a half, just living in my car or bouncing around peoples' houses, going to 7-Eleven at the end of the day and asking them for the taquitos that they were going to throw out because I hadn't eaten in two days.''' ,'''I knew that my love for the Sisters of Mercy, Lords of the New Church and that kind of stuff, was never going to lend itself well to a direct interpretation in Black Veil Brides.''' ,'''To be honest, I've always been really interested in the role of the host, whether it's our kind of Billy Crystal-style traditional awards show host or when you have someone like Louis C.K. or a more edgy stand-up comedian do their take on a hosting role.''' ,'''Always be yourself and rebel against what people tell you should be and be whatever you want to.''' ,'''For someone like me, music is all I've ever thought about - playing big shows, and then, when you take something that is based around your music and put it in a completely different medium, it's a really interesting and cool emotion to watch.''' ,'''I never anticipated seeing 40.''' ,'''There is nothing more, I guess, cannibalistic than the metal or the hard rock scene, it seems.''' ,'''Even if you don't like what I do, and you don't like my band, you might have a fan that likes both of us, and why would you wanna alienate them?''' ,'''The Misfits skull was my second tattoo, and the Danzig was my third.''' ,'''For us, we are interested in doing what's cool for us and what's cool for the audience. That's it.''' ,'''Every Christmas, all I ever wanted was Playskool instruments. It was my entire life. And then by the time I was 6 or 7 years old, it became, 'Now I'm going to force my entire family to watch me perform all these rock songs.'''' ,'''It seems like a gross waste of time to continue our career predicated on the idea that we're going to divide opinion. What's more important is just doing something that you love.''' ,'''I don't really have any interest in allowing other people's kind of idiotic, unnecessary, either bigotry or hatred or whatever derision they have for me, I don't allow for it to really bother me, because I don't need it.''' ,'''There's no place for Depeche Mode and the Sisters of Mercy in the music I make with my band. If I was a fan, I wouldn't want to hear that on a Black Veil Brides record. It was important for me and for the integrity of the band not to tarnish it.''' ,'''That's what makes me insufferable to be around, is that most of my life I have assumed that everyone wants to see me perform and do things all the time.''' ,'''How do we make a record that's true to the vibe of the band but still maintain the pace of moving forward and doing something fresh?''' ,'''The image of the band has always been something that's evolved or changed with every record cycle that we've done. I think, in a lot of respects, that's because we were so interested in having a visual representation for the music that we were making.''' ,'''I don't want to paint myself as some villain - I was never a bad guy doing horrible things, but I got too caught up in wanting a very specific thing to happen to the band. Ultimately, I had to find the ability in myself to get over that and stop being so stringent and learn to laugh a little bit more.''' ,'''It's really important for us as a band, that when someone is giving us grief on stage, to show our fans how important it is that they stand up for themselves and that they feel confident in themselves.''' ,'''We're entertainers. We're theatrical.''' ,'''I was a little chubby kid that no girls ever talked to. I had little chance of becoming an internationally known rock star. Music was my escape and my belief system.''' ,'''Being a singer, I can easily break facial extremities, but breaking my nose in Luxembourg was extremely painful.''' ,'''Coming out of 'Wretched and Divine,' I was still wanting to explore the more theatrical elements of songwriting. That led to Andy Black.''' ,'''All I ever wanted to do was be in a band.''' ,'''On Warped Tour in Boise, Idaho, I broke my tooth on the mic. I took a pretty significant chunk out of my tooth and had to have it sanded down. It wasn't the most painful injury, but it was the most unexpected one.''' ,'''The only real inspiration or muse that I have is just the life that I live.''' ,'''We never made attempts to say we were anybody's role model or the be-all-end-all of what people should look up to. We have always just been very open about the fact that we have difficulties and we are messed-up people, just as our fans are.''' ,'''Nobody is convinced that Johnny Depp goes to Walmart dressed as Sweeney Todd, but everyone expects us to.''' ,'''Rock stars aren't crapped out of the sky.''' ,'''I've always been a big fan of utopian, future, new-world stories - 'V For Vendetta,' comic books, graphic novels.''' ,'''I don't do anything unless I think about it six months in advance.''' ,'''I don't think I necessarily am prepared to write about anybody else's life but mine.''' ,'''I'm real pleased and humbled by the support that the fans show.''' ,'''I left high school very early. I was 17. So I guess it wasn't that early, but I did not get a high school education.''' ,'''As you get older, you realize you're not that cool. You also realize the people you called posers are just people like you.''' ,'''We know that listening to Black Veil Brides, wearing Black Veil Bride shirts, or being in Black Veil Brides isn't always the most popular thing in the world.''' ,'''My job as the host of a rock awards show is not to be as divisive as possible, but certainly you want to be able to interject your jokes and how you feel about stuff.''' ,'''The older I got, I started to realize more it's not necessarily that any of us are inherently bad or good; you just kind of carve your own way, and you are your experiences and your surroundings and what you grow up in.''' ,'''I was this little kid writing songs. I look back at having that dream, and it's weird. Being able to do it and live out your dream on any scale is amazing. I don't take any of it for granted at all.''' ,'''Our shows have always been sort of an all-generations thing, people from 6 to 60.''' ,'''The pen and the written word hold a great deal of power.''' ,'''Being able to be one of the headline bands on Warped Tour was a dream I had since I was in middle school.''' ,'''You can't deny a band whose fans will literally do anything to see them win the awards. We're very appreciative to the fan base. That mutual feeling of appreciation is something that really helps.''' ,'''As far as being onstage, commanding presence, I've always looked up to people like Axl Rose and Freddie Mercury and Paul Stanley - the rock gods. I've always wanted to be able to achieve that level of commanding nature onstage and really leading people at a show.''' ,'''It's not easy to be the weird kid or the rebel.''' ,'''We want people to know they shouldn't feel like social pariahs just because they want to dress differently or listen to rock n' roll.''' ,'''I have no goal to have artistic credibility.''' ,'''The devotion of the BVB Army, with its very big online presence, is amazing. We've been fortunate from the very beginning. It was something that was really able to spur on our career.''' ,'''In terms of stage presence for me, I'm influenced by a myriad of things. A lot of punk performers, people like Dave Vanian from The Damned and Davey Havok from AFI was a huge influence on me when I was younger.''' ,'''We truly believe with hard work, dedication and perseverance, we can become the best at what we do. No one wants to become mediocre.''' ,'''When I walk around on the street and someone comes up to me, I have just as many full-grown men with large beards in Slipknot shirts saying he likes my band as much as I do girls with bright pink hair.''' ,'''There was never a time when I wasn't making guitars out of cardboard or dressing up like the Misfits.''' ,'''I am a clinical zombie.''' ,'''If what you're writing is genuine, regardless of whether it sounds cliche or people wouldn't necessarily think it's the most brilliant metaphor in the world, it's always important to be genuine with what you're writing; at least, that's how I feel.''' ,'''Kiss will always be Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley to me.''' ,]
