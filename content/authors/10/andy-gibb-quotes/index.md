- There is nothing to compare with the instantaneous feedback a singer gets from the people sitting in front of him. That is where it all comes together - all the rehearsing and working to get everything just exactly right.
- I grew up in a show business family, so we've always had a great sense of balance, being so close to my parents.
- I respect the people who buy my records and come to my concerts. It's only fair that I always try to give them the very best that's in me. After all, I need them more than they need me.
- Before, I was terrified on stage. I only play guitar during the acoustic songs. After a while, you can elicit certain responses from the crowd, like Elvis.
- Songs don't just come out of the air. They take time, but it's good fun, too. Maurice gave me encouragement.
- I've been working at performing for five years now. I've been working in Australia and Spain and England. When I was only 15 or 16, 1 was performing in bars; I could have had legal problems, but it's also the only way to get to know what music is all about.
- Even my older brothers' early success 10 years ago didn't change me since there was such an age difference.
- I have to take time occasionally to get away from the pressures of this business. If I don't, I think I would get stale, and that would show in my music.
- I'll have to get people to write songs for me right now until my own writing comes around.
- I grew up in a show business family, so we've always had a great sense of balance, being so close to my parents. I've always known what is and isn't reality.
- Girls are always running through my mind. They don't dare walk.
- I have been to hell and back. I had a very, very bad nervous breakdown.
- In 1973 we moved to the British Isle of Man, and I put my first band together for one year, named Melody Fair.
- Victoria was just as much in love with me as I was with her. We could not bear to be apart for a single second. We were like two lovers shipwrecked on a desert island. There was no world outside our love.
