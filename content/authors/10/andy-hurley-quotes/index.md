- The only actual solution is the eventual collapse and demise of civilization... I think it needs to happen, but no one, not even me, really wants it to happen.
- I definitely stayed away from Twitter. I didn't want to be geotagged or anything.
- Patrick and Joe were so young when we started the band. As slow as it was, with all the touring and crappy clubs we played, we still never had time to stop and reflect. When we took a break, it finally gave us time to reflect and grow up.
- I suppose people do sometimes not understand the seeming disparity between my onstage personality and my public personality in the press. But I feel that I am definitely a louder, more outspoken person with those I am close to.
- My calendar was empty. Touring the way we did and having a schedule like we did institutionalizes you in a way where you don't know anything else. I think I went through the darkest depression I've ever felt in my life.
- If we did end tomorrow, I would be so stoked and proud of everything I've done and how I lived my life. I feel like I've had enough experiences for multiple lives.
- One thing that's always been important to me is to try and build a tool kit, drumming-wise, that was diverse and wide-ranging in terms of what I played.
- I never really feel old. Young 'til I die, minus some Internet-speak misunderstandings.
- My whole thing is I'm not into civilization as a whole.
- I would never slam my iPhone, and I never punched a metal door frame for any time.
- Ultimately, I am an employee of a corporation, and that's weird and does contradict some of the things I believe in. But at the same time, I have to make a living.
- Music is the first thing I didn't give up.
- Being the drummer of Fall Out Boy, and any other project I've ever done, is most importantly about playing for the music. Staying out of the way when it's needed and playing more when it makes sense.
