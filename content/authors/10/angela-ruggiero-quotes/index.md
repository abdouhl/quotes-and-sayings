- It's not about, 'Let me play as long as I can so I don't have to grow up.' It's about, 'Let me play as long as I enjoy it,' and when it's time to step away, I can step away gracefully even if I'm still good enough to keep playing, because I'm ready for that next phase.
- It feels right. But it's emotional. Saying goodbye to anything you've done that long is hard.
- That's the awesome part. Little girls now have a chance to look up and see women playing soccer, basketball, softball and now hockey - and know they can win a gold medal, too.
- There were no women's players I knew of. I didn't even know women's hockey existed.
- In a way, by being fully committed to the Olympic movement globally, I'm better able to promote women's hockey and talk about women's hockey and put a face to women's hockey, to all the IOC members.
- The Women's Sports Foundation holds a unique position in developing opportunities for girls and women of all abilities to be active whether recreationally or competitively, and I'm excited to help lead the organization to impact even more lives.

- I still love hockey. It's just I'm at a different stage of my life and I think I'm just ready to grow in other ways outside of just being a hockey player.
- I'm not playing for lack of options. But this is such a fleeting thing. When I'm done, I'm never, ever going to be able to come back to it. I know Vancouver is my last go.
- I find that I've tried to become a better hockey player every year and not just hold on. At the same time, I've also made it a point to increase or grow in some other area of my life. If I were just playing hockey, I would probably be done with the sport.
- I'm in the perfect position. It's a sports position and a political position where I can help better the lives of athletes around the world.
- I feel honored and privileged to have represented the USA program over the past 16 years. USA Hockey will always be a part of me and I will cherish the experiences and memories with this team.
- I wish I could play the whole game and come back tomorrow.
- Right now, I'm standing behind the glass, and I guess that's a metaphor for how my life will be going forward.
- But inside of me I knew that the Olympics were still there. I was still young enough. I knew that once I transitioned out of hockey, it would be really hard to go back.
- I'm able to give a voice to the athletes around the world - use my degree for something other than the power play.
- I look at myself, and how much I've gotten just because I play a sport well.
- The more I've done work with the IOC the more I've come to realize I'm really excited about this, the work that I'm doing and the impact that I can have if I'm fully committed to it.
- As a veteran, you're a little more poised on that mental side. But athletically, I didn't really think I could get better.
- I'm getting more towards that point where I'm ready to kind of pass the torch on and see the next generation succeed behind me.
