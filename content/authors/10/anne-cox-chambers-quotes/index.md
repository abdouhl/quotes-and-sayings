- Bill Milliken is a big hero of mine.
- When my sister and I came along, my father's political life was completely over. He ran for president the year I was born. So that was the end of it. He had been congressman first, then governor, before all that. So when we came along, he was running the Dayton newspaper.
- I just am a Democrat. I could never, never be a Republican.
