quotes = ['''You're isolated as a writer, so I always envied people who could get up early and drive to work and fit into society.''' ,'''My father never liked me or my sister, and he never liked our mother either, after an initial infatuation, and in fact, he never liked anyone at all after an hour or two, no, no one except a stooge.''' ,'''The difference between 'lighght' and another type of poem with more words is that it doesn't have a reading process. Even a five-word poem has a beginning, middle, and end. A one-word poem doesn't. You can see it all at once. It's instant.''' ,'''As I grow older, the idea takes increasing hold in me that we've misunderstood our own delicacy and diversity as human beings.''' ,'''I have friends who died being successful bohemians. Today, I see people my age who are gifted but who insisted on staying in this group, and it's beaten them so bad. They have to spend so much time on ego maintenance, they can't get any work done.
