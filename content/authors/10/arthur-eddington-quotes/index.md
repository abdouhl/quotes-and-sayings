One thing at least is certain, light has weight. One thing is certain and the rest debate. Light rays, when near the Sun, do not go straight.''' ,'''Who will observe the observers?''' ,'''We often think that when we have completed our study of one we know all about two, because 'two' is 'one and one.' We forget that we still have to make a study of 'and.'''' ,'''It is sound judgment to hope that in the not too distant future we shall be competent to understand so simple a thing as a star.''' ,'''We used to think that if we knew one, we knew two, because one and one are two. We are finding that we must learn a great deal more about 'and'.''' ,'''Shuffling is the only thing which Nature cannot undo.''' ,'''We have found a strange footprint on the shores of the unknown.''' ,'''It is even possible that laws which have not their origin in the mind may be irrational, and we can never succeed in formulating them.''' ,'''Proof is an idol before whom the pure mathematician tortures himself.''' ,'''We have found that where science has progressed the farthest, the mind has but regained from nature that which the mind put into nature.''' ,]
