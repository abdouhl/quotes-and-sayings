- I know I'm going to be the next big hip-hop artist. I just want to save hip-hop... that's my job.
- You going to call me arrogant for believing in myself? Come on! It's a competitive sport. Rappin' is the closest thing to boxing. Jay-Z said that. You gotta fight every day.
- Whatever woman I love... I gotta love her. She might be a hood rat, but she's gotta have respect for my mother.
- Especially today, with the Internet, you have people who have best friends that they never met, with Facebook and Twitter and stuff. If you're really friends, it doesn't matter if I'm on the other side of the world. We'll still be friends and find a way to connect.
- I work better under pressure.
- I've been writing way before 'X Factor,' and I've been doing shows before 'X Factor.' And everything I did on this show was me being me. Same way I acted in the show is the same way I act now as an artist.

- I like to keep certain stuff to myself just because I feel like technology is taking over people's lives.
- I'm from Brooklyn, New York. I'm a hip-hop artist. That's just that. You're going to have to accept me or just not be a fan, I guess.

- When I say that I'm not dancing, people get it confused, like I'm not going to do anything outside of rap. It's not that. When I leave this earth, I want to be remembered as an M.C. But I'm definitely going to touch a lot of other genres, not just rapping.
- No, I ain't a star - I'm just a kid from Brooklyn, living his dream.

- I wasn't the cool kid in school, but I wasn't the lame one. I knew I wasn't cool, so I called myself lame, and that's what made me cool in front of the cool kids.
- I was 15 when I read the script for 'Earth to Echo.' I thought it was amazing, and I couldn't think of turning it down. It's awesome for a kid from Brooklyn to have an opportunity to be on the big screen. And I had a great experience learning what the movie business is like. So, I'm glad I did it.
- I want people to know that I'm not just another kid M.C. I'm actually a fan of good music and hip-hop.
- I know, if I would have won 'X-Factor' and if I would have continued in that lane, I would have spiraled out of control. Performing on there was good, but it wasn't me. It was me compromising for the judges, just different people around.
- I breathe music... The acting is a job, but music is life. You need a job to live.
- I plan to release just as much music as I can. Movies, I should be working on a cartoon, reality show, everything. Everything I could do, like a clothing line, like a lot of things are in the works. I plan on just performing everywhere. I'm gonna be worldwide!
- It's always been fun for me to play somebody else. I did drama class when I was younger. It kind of just happened. I never said, 'I want to act.' I just auditioned for the role, I got it. I was blessed with this opportunity to be in 'Earth to Echo.' It's fun for me; it's cool to do.
- I don't want music to be a job for me; I want it to be something I'm doing for fun. As long it's not a job, then you're straight.
- Don't let people see when you're mad - just smile and laugh.
- If it's a good movie, it's a good movie. I don't care about the genres.
- If I'm extra happy or excited, it'll take me an hour or two to write a song. Or, if I'm really sad or something, it will take me about a day. But I have a specific way of writing: I just listen to the beat. I think about what I'm going to write over the beat.
- The cats that are doing they thing, you have to search to really find them, to find rappers that can actually rap and speak messages in the music. That's not a good thing at all.
- I'm thinking of the kids of the next generation and the music that they need to hear. Before, I was just rapping to rap. Now, I'm rapping to change the world.
- When you think positively, you attract positive people. If I'm on a mission to be successful, and I'm positive all the time, then more positive people will come around me, and we'll help each other. If you're negative, you'll find yourself surrounded by negative people.
- I want to go to Jamaica, actually. My whole family's from there, so I'd like to go there.
- I started in '07, and I remember, at that point, nobody was trying to hear from me because I was a young rapper. I'd be saying stuff better than some of what the hottest rappers were saying back then, but nobody was trying to hear from me.
- My mom convinced me to audition for 'The X Factor.' And I just said, 'O.K., let me see what it's about. $5 million? Might as well try.' I tried out, and it worked out. I got through top seven out of 200,000, so I'm proud.
- People aren't taking their time with the music no more. There's less quality in the records.
