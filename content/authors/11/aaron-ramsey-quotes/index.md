Extra effort in training makes all the difference.''' ,'''I've always been able to get into the box, but in the past, I'd been very rash in my finishing; I wasn't clear with what I was doing in the final third. When it came to shooting, I was very rushed. I wasn't hitting the ball cleanly.''' ,'''Winning just makes you more determined to go on and do more.''' ,'''When I was in school with my friends and stuff, you always used to put yourself in the situation of footballers of the time and pretend to be them.''' ,'''I think a top-class midfielder needs to be able to tackle, get up and down the pitch, pass, create opportunities, and score goals. That's why I try to do everything; that's what I judge my game on.''' ,'''I live for football, and my real passion is just to go out there and express myself and show everybody what I'm capable of doing. It's what I've always known since I was a kid.''' ,'''I'm a very motivated guy.''' ,'''You have to give 100 percent in the Champions League, as you're up against the biggest teams.''' ,'''There's always pressure on Arsenal to go out and win games and win trophies.''' ,'''As a kid, I was always pretending to score the goal in the FA Cup final, and I managed to live my dream.''' ,'''When you're playing, it's important to focus 100 per cent on what you're doing.''' ,'''Arsene Wenger gives youngsters opportunities, and if he thinks that you're good enough, he'll play you.''' ,'''I like to be involved as much as I can in the game, and in the middle, you're definitely the heartbeat of the team. When you're on the right, you can go minutes without seeing the ball, and that's a long time when you're out on the pitch.''' ,]
