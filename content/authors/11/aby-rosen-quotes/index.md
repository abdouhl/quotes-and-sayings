- I understand entertaining. You want people to walk out saying, 'I spent a night with interesting people.'
- I could go out to five parties a day if I wanted to. I don't. I have attachments to my wife and kids - and about 20 pieces of art.
- I enjoy the burger joint the same way I enjoy fancy meals.
- I like '50s and '60s American art. I have 85 or 90 Warhols.
- New York as an industry is the best city for real estate. You're in a very transparent market. If you need to liquidate, you make three phone calls and you could sell something, even in the worst market. It is also less forgiving; if you make a mistake you can lose money.
- If you give a party, you better give it right.
- I spend time with people who are movers and shakers, and others who are just friends I really care for. Some of them are rich, some of them are poor. I couldn't care less. I'm not a snob.
