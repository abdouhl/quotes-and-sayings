- The best comics enlist you to take accountability for who you are, whether you like it or not.
- As a reader, when the writer gets sentimental, you drift, because there's something fishy going on there. You recognize a moment that's largely about the writer and the writer's own need to believe in something that might not in fact exist. As a reader, you think, 'Where did the story go? Where did the person I'm reading about go?'
- There's one thing I know for sure: When I'm most opinionated, my writing sucks.
- It shouldn't be a matter of who deserves help or not, but of whether we want to be a country that allows its neediest to continue to need. Condemnation of individuals and their choices mutes all these other really important logistical questions about funding and budget and politics.
- My dad taught me that language was a powerful tool.
- It's hard for me to understand how poverty can be invisible to so many people, since I see it everywhere. Readers sometimes think this world is so different; on the one hand, they feel connected to the people I'm writing about, and on the other hand, they're saying their lives are a world away.
- I like to say, 'You get as much story as you can take.' But you have to effectively render it.
- Serious loss brings you into one of the world's silent fraternities.
- A big part of reporting is just being present. You have to show up ten days in a row to get the one telling detail.
- What one reads in the newspaper and what one sees on the street are absolutely not the same.
- I think you end up on the lucky side, or you don't.
- Adrian Leon LeBlanc, my dad and my namesake, his keen joy in observing people and the world is the reason I became a journalist.
- My earnestness at the injustices I witnessed when I was writing 'Random Family' may have been my gravest reportorial offense during the early years of reporting. When I discuss the book with students, they often ask me how I could 'stand by' in the face of so much suffering; the egregiousness wasn't my powerlessness but my surprise.
- Illness transforms the things you most fear into the things you crave and would hold onto if you could.
- Satisfaction isn't a state that comes easily to me.
