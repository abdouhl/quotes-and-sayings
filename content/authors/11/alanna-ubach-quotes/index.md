- I love to work.
- My mother was born in Sinaloa, and she moved to Los Angeles when she was three years old. My father was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and moved here when he was 19. They met at the Palladium in Hollywood, and they've been together from that moment on.
- Being an actor is lot like being a dancer: you always have to go back to the bar and either work or take classes. Otherwise, you'll get rusty.
- I was so naive when I began acting, professionally.
- Oh, I like to take classes every chance that I get. If I'm not working after about four or five months, I'll jump back into a class.
- I met my best friend in a sandbox when I was three, and he would grow up to be gay and loved to dress in my clothing any chance he got.
- My favorite part of my appearance is my height. I'm five foot one and I feel feminine being small.
- You really have to be a morning person if you want to be a teacher.
- It was a lot of fun being a child actress. It suited me. I don't think it suits everybody, but I was in it because I had a passion, not because my parents wanted me to make money. If other kids want to do it, and they really like acting, go for it.
- Unfortunately, we are a society that does look down on divorce when, ironically, there are more single divorced people in the world right now. So, the fact of the matter is that it's a reality, and more people should obviously embrace wanting to change, wanting to move on from a relationship that just no longer works for them.
- Yes, I was actually an acting teacher for a while.
- I think that people should never be ashamed of wanting to move on with their lives and move on from their partners. I have a lot of girlfriends who were married in their early 20s and are now divorced because they basically grew apart - they evolved into another person in their 30s.
- I'm a night owl.
- When I get a role, I try to delve as deeply as possible into the character.
- I act with my gut instincts.
- I picked up the Puerto Rican accent from my father, and my sister picked up my mother's very clear, concise, and slow Mexican-Spanish. So, when she does speak, she speaks with diction. She pronounces every word.
- Oh, 'Sports Night' was tough because 'Sports Night' was... Well, you know, it's like Mamet. It's Sorkin. And I didn't realize that you had to immediately be off of the other actors' last line in their dialogue.
- I've always wanted to act since I was little.
- That's always the actor's worst nightmare: that what they're working on is going to be the last thing they'll ever work on. No lie. So I was very excited to land 'Girlfriends' Guide' immediately.
- I've never had plastic surgery, but if they made a new invention for making people taller, I'd be the first to have the surgery.
- If a woman is comfortable with herself, I think that's what radiates. I think the moment you start questioning your body and looks is when you get into trouble.
- I've always wanted to act and I can't think of anything else I'd want to do, honestly.
- My role in 'Legally Blonde' was really rewarding, because I had so much fun working on the movie. I've had really rewarding experiences on tiny low budget films that you'll never see but where I had a cool time creating characters as well. I love almost all of the characters I've played.
