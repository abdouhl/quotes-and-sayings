- In Chicago, anything that you're doing, the community gives it value. Every little improv show, every scrappy reading, and every lead on a Goodman mainstage. It's all a promising opportunity for a young actor.
- It really wasn't about picking Chicago. I feel like Chicago picked me.
- I have fallen in love with Chicago. The community here is loving, supportive, and welcoming.
- I actually started working in Chicago while I was still a student; I did the Chicago premiere of 'The History Boys' at the end of my junior year. I had come to Chicago for Northwestern University. I didn't quite know about the theater community, and what I did know was mostly the improv.
- I've spent so much of life thinking of my body as my enemy.
- When you're starting out, say yes to everything you can.
