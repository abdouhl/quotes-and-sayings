- As an adult (after college) and as an artist I thought about what was real, what sustained me - it was Christian Science. I was using that when I didn't know it. Saying yes to the Light and your better instinct.
- Television studios bet the farm on reality shows, where they didn't need any actors and movie studios had no plans for any quality movies that required the presence of me.
- I am not getting any younger and am taking a new approach to life.
- I just had a full body cleanse. And am eating right and exercising a lot.
- Even when I was saying I was Agnostic and trying to figure out my thoughts, I felt God was allowing me to do that.
- I have always done what I wanted to do.
- Does my character hate Bree? Well, let's just put it this way. Bree hasn't seen the last of me. I gave that drunk gal a ride home a few episodes ago and she turned on me!
- And I communed with many different faiths and even when I wanted to be rebellious I never did not believe in Him. I never believed the people who said God was destructive or punishing.
- You very seldom see a picture where you watch the process of falling in love.
- Everyone has the impulse to be elite.
- I think people need to understand that with plays and with cinema, when you hear about it, call and get a ticket then or go and see it then. It's especially with the play, which I can do because it's a limited run.
- I can't say too much about it because I don't know a lot. We're not told what's in store for our characters until we turn up to shoot the episode. But it's fair to say that Betty and her son bring a brand new mystery to the street and they will be around all season.
- After 9/11 and the impending actors' strike of a few years ago, roles dried up for everyone.
- When you feel a connection, a gut connection, a heart connection, it's a very special thing. What's familiar to everyone is watching people falling in love; it doesn't happen on screen that often. People fall in lust, then they're suddenly together.
- I rather go to see a good play than be in one.
