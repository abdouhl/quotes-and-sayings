- I mean, I like to think of myself as being strong and independent, but I definitely wasn't like that at 14.
- I like to take a character and develop it.
- I mean, God, I'm so lucky right now with the opportunities that I've had. There's nothing to worry about.
- I don't think I'll ever be comfortable with the idea of being famous.
- I still get really nervous, though, before each performance. It kind of hits about 15 minutes before we go onstage - sometimes I don't even want to go on. But once I'm onstage I'm fine.
- My private life... Nobody should care. I think it's weird.
- I think everybody faces challenges in their lives. I've definitely been through it - not to the extreme that Astrid did. I try to keep some kind of identity and strength.
- I did musicals from about age 10 to 18.
- I've always loved acting with adults versus like the whole High School feel.
- You know what? It's a great conversation starter, right? You meet friends that way. Sometimes it's a good thing. And then other times, I guess, the person is just a little too... then you kind of like want to back away. It depends on the person, you know?
- I'd like to play characters who are older - I don't want to be playing 14-year-olds too much longer.
- But, you know, it really depends on the character. Age doesn't really matter.
- I'm 24. I think when I was 18, 19, I had a problem with it because I wanted to look older and more womanly. I look in the mirror and I don't feel or look 14 to myself, regardless of what other people think. I'm fine with it and it really doesn't matter what age I'm playing.
- I don't know... I don't want people to know everything about me.
- For Astrid, no matter what challenges they go through, they are going to face each other. It's hard for a daughter to accept that her mother is that selfish and that terrible.
- My dad's an architect and my mom owned a French bakery for twelve years.
- But you're not necessarily ever going to be handed a script where you can say: it's all done and perfect.
- Obviously you don't want to be anonymous, but you don't want everyone to know your life.
- I just want to act. I just want to do the work.
