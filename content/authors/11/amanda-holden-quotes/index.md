I absolutely won't give up.''' ,'''My family are my priority but I've always had a strong work ethic and I like to be busy.''' ,'''It is going to take a very brave man to love me.''' ,'''I'm in the lucky position financially where I don't have to do things I don't want to do.''' ,'''I am an optimist.

She thought they were just like her pets at home.''' ,'''I want to be buried with a mobile phone, just in case I'm not dead.''' ,'''People have been able to see that as cheeky and as flirty as I am, I am not the dreadful slapper that the press used to portray me as. But it will probably all turn around and people will hate me again in a couple of years.''' ,'''My dream is to have a gay son.''' ,'''I was a prefect at school, I never had a tattoo, got a detention or pierced my ears more than once.''' ,]
