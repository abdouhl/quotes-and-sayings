- It so depends on each script, because you can say... I always thought I wouldn't have wanted to do something that was kind of like as big and commercial as 'The Dark is Rising,' but I really liked the script. I thought it was really clever.
- I want to stay below the radar and make good films. I have to be careful; I don't want my life to change. I really don't want to be a movie star.
- In film, I don't think I'd try directing. Maybe one day, but I'd certainly want to go to film school or something before I tried to do something like that. That would be quite scary.
- I am definitely a west London girl.
- It's so English to hate L.A. I'd like to say I love it, but I don't. It's such a weird place. If it were my choice, I wouldn't spend a day there. Everything shuts at 11. And everyone thinks they're so crazy and wild and liberal, and they're not!
- I really like writing music. That's kind of like my little hobby. I like that because sometimes you don't really have any control when you're an actor, over what you're doing next, and everything is kind of decided by other people. You're always waiting to hear from people.
- It would be good to see what the Queen gets up to at Buckingham Palace. I bet she spends her whole time watching 'Coronation Street.'
- The wrap party for the 'Lorna Doone' TV series was pretty special. We went to about four clubs, then four people's houses, and I got home at midday the next day. I'd been wearing ridiculous green shoes all night, and the dye had smudged all over my legs.
- The views from Waterloo Bridge are amazing - you can see so much of London.
- Being the hot girl... you wouldn't want that. It's overrated. Being sexy is actually really boring to me. I'd rather be... I'd rather be interesting.
- There's no buying a greasy breakfast in L.A. - it's all organic juices.
