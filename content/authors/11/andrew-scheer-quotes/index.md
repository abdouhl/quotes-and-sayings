quotes = ['''Justin Trudeau tries to say that Canada is back. I say the Liberals are back - back to ignoring the rules and abusing the privileges of power.''' ,'''It's conservative policies that create the conditions for prosperity, and we'll all benefit thanks to that.''' ,'''We have to stay away from the personal attacks. I think it turns off a lot of Canadians.''' ,'''I was probably that obnoxious kid in first-year university who would try to win a political debate by just, you know, being belligerent.''' ,'''I think there's a fine line between confidence and arrogance.''' ,'''I'm a big believer in freedom and people's rights to express themselves and not have government interfere in that type of thing.''' ,'''Obviously, what we had under the original NAFTA was very good. Canada prospered greatly from it.''' ,'''More and more Canadians are seeing through Liberal deceptions.''' ,'''We've seen the government give out subsidies to companies, those companies turn around and use it for executive bonuses.''' ,'''We would never accept a prime minister saying, 'Well, maybe I'll intervene and use a trade issue as a link to an independent investigation into criminal activity.'''' ,'''To think that a Catholic bishop must answer to a civil authority over matters of faith is abominable. It is abhorrent to me, to other Catholics, and to every member of every faith community.''' ,'''Some people say I smile too much.''' ,'''I do believe that the U.K. over the years has given up a tremendous amount of sovereignty. The bureaucratic nature of the E.U., the different levels of government, the fact that court decisions in the U.K. can be appealed to a higher level of court in Europe, those are all things I don't think Canadians would ever accept for ourselves.''' ,'''I like to think I'm a nice guy.''' ,'''Whether it's Liberal or Conservative - any time someone has a perspective on what their experience has been as prime minister of the country, it's always interesting.''' ,'''Justin Trudeau had a message of asking Canadians to have trust in our immigration system.

I've been out any time there is major events. So I've always had an open door policy with the chiefs and individuals on- and off-reserve.''' ,'''We know that the government in China has been involved in cyber attacks before. I look at our partners around the world, our traditional allies, our NATO partners who are making the same assessment. We share so much with them and rely on their technology, their expertise and interoperability in many aspects of our own armed forces.''' ,'''Every country in history that has gone down dark paths, where governments take on too much control and really intervene and take away those freedoms, often start with an attack on the freedom to disagree.''' ,'''Individuals who have demonstrated serious violent behaviour or have been involved in gang activity have forfeited the right to ever be trusted to own a firearm.''' ,'''Are we better off if we displace jobs and investments to other countries and global emissions go up? I say no. Let's bring that production here and have less emissions globally because we can make things more efficiently and cleaner.''' ,'''We have to recognize is that the best way to improve the quality of life for First Nations and Indigenous Canadians is through economic development and activity.''' ,'''I believe in it so passionately because anywhere you look in the world, where governments become too big or become authoritarian, speech and expression is one of the first fundamental freedoms to go.''' ,'''Part of what the carbon tax does is make Canada less competitive.''' ,'''When I was younger, I remember families like mine who had to deal with the disastrous policies of the 1970s.''' ,'''My job is to make sure our caucus and our movement is united. That means not bringing up divisive issues that would divide even our own party.''' ,'''The difference between Justin Trudeau and myself is I have had real world experience.

I want to be part of the solution-identifying process, talking about, 'What are the practical things that we can achieve that the Conservatives can offer?'''' ,'''If a factory closes down here and pops up in China where they don't have access to clean technology, clean energy, then the world is not better off.''' ,'''As a firearms owner myself, I'm very sympathetic to the concerns that people like me face every day.''' ,'''The Conservative party believes Canada is stronger for being able to welcome people from all over the world.''' ,'''Conservatives need to show Canadians our positive vision and why Conservatives believe what we believe.''' ,'''Canadians didn't vote for a carbon tax. Justin Trudeau campaigned, promised that he wouldn't create a carbon tax.''' ,'''I'm proud to say that we are the party of Canada's first prime minister, the father of our federation, and the visionary who made this land possible.''' ,'''We've made tremendous successes in clean energy. We should be proud of what we've accomplished.''' ,'''Conservatives want to see every Canadian prosper.''' ,'''People should not have to worry about violence in their own neighbourhoods, but sadly, that is a reality that more and more Canadians face.''' ,'''No matter what the issue is, conservative principles are always better for people than big-government, liberal principles.''' ,'''Caucus unity always needs to be foremost in the mind of the leader.

There's no reason why Justin Trudeau should be helping him.''' ,'''Nobody believes that Justin Trudeau is trying to save taxpayers' money.''' ,'''A single tax return for Quebecers will eliminate unnecessary paperwork for families and businesses.''' ,'''Conservatives have to be more than just Liberals who are good at math.''' ,'''A leader's job is to find common ground.''' ,'''I think it's a disgrace that we're allowing extreme voices in this country to erase our proud heritage.''' ,'''We don't always win when we are united, but we always lose when we are divided.''' ,'''The government of China has admitted that they've been involved in cyber infiltrations around the world and in governments.''' ,'''Let's make sure that when companies make investments to reduce emissions that they're rewarded for that and encouraged to do more.''' ,'''The Conservatives win when we have a positive message, an aspirational message.''' ,'''While millionaire Liberals like Justin Trudeau may want higher gas prices, hardworking Canadian families definitely do not.''' ,'''I will withhold federal funding from universities that shut down debate and can't stand different points of view.''' ,'''I have a very inquisitive mind, and I like to know.

We saw during the softwood lumber negotiations that he failed to get an extension while President Obama was still in office.''' ,'''I don't think that if Justin Trudeau came back from the NAFTA negotiations with a new clause - 'Oh, by the way, there's going to be a new legislature that Americans will send members to that will pass laws that will bind Canada' - I don't believe Canada would ever go for that.''' ,'''I believe very firmly that we can get to balanced budgets without raising taxes and without cutting transfers to the provinces or to individuals.''' ,'''I've always been very passionate about issues.

I reject that.''' ,'''The pain and hardship the Trudeau Liberals are causing Canadians is just temporary.''' ,'''I'm not terribly science-y. I couldn't tell you what's the binomial equation or how many atoms in a mole.''' ,'''I view Indigenous Canadians as an integral part of our society, proud of their contribution to Canadian history, great deal of respect for all they did pre-Confederation, the way that they have been partners in building this society we have, and I'm very proud to represent a dozen First Nations communities in my own riding.''' ,'''We have to be very realistic as a party as to what we're promising Canadians going into the 2019 election.''' ,'''Look - 'sunny ways' don't pay the bills. You have to have opportunities.''' ,'''We've shown Canadians that, when we have a strong message and when we stick to our principles, Conservatives can win anywhere.''' ,'''The Conservative party under my leadership will continue to be an inclusive, welcoming party that welcomes not only immigrants but also refugees and ensures that Canada plays its role in welcoming people from difficult situations.''' ,'''I will not introduce legislation to reopen divisive issues or to reopen issues that have already been settled by previous governments.''' ,'''I've got five kids.

I'm talking about the real Liberal Party: the tax-hiking, rule-breaking, perk-loving, deficit-spending, debt-mounting, virtue-signalling Liberals Canadians have come to know and despise.''' ,'''Our position is that we believe that Canada has to have a comprehensive plan to significantly reduce global emissions.''' ,'''The Conservative Party must be a party for all of its members.''' ,'''We have a variety of views in our party, a variety of views in our caucus.''' ,'''When it comes to Senate reform, in general, I've always been a believer in an elected Senate and would hope to achieve aspects of Senate reform.''' ,'''I think it's a disgrace that some would allow extreme voices in this country to erase our proud heritage.''' ,]
