quotes = ['''I've been at Amazon for almost 20 years at this point, so I've obviously drunk the Kool-Aid.''' ,'''Netflix, despite the fact that they compete very aggressively with Prime Video on the Amazon side, they run everything on top of AWS and have for several years - same with Disney, Warner, Fox, HBO and Turner, they all run on AWS.''' ,'''I took my last final exam at HBS, the first Friday of May in 1997, and I started Amazon next Monday. No, I didn't know what my job was going to be, or what my title was going to be.''' ,'''We'd realized in the first ten years we'd built an infrastructure competence deep in the stack - reliable, scalable cost effective data centers to grow the Amazon retail biz the way we needed to. But we'd built Amazon so quickly that a number of the pieces of the platform had become entangled.''' ,'''For us, employee safety is priority number one for us in our fulfillment centers.''' ,'''Invention requires two things: One, the ability to try a lot of experiments, and two, not having to live with the collateral damage of failed experiments.''' ,'''We always had a lot of optimism for this game, New World.' Customers really liked it; it tested really well.''' ,'''At Amazon, we are very careful about what big strategic bets we place, but the ones we make, we keep iterating until we find something that we think has resonance with customers.''' ,'''The company has been clear from the start that we try to serve customers long-term, and long-term investors are going to be more excited about Amazon than short-term investors.''' ,'''You just can't learn certain lessons until you get to different elbows of the curve in scale. With a business that most estimate is several times the size of the next nine providers combined, we've learned certain lessons that you just can't learn until you get to that level of scale.''' ,'''We don't think of HQ1 being Seattle any longer. We really think of it as Puget Sound.''' ,'''If you're going to invest in something over a long period of time, that you believe is important and can change the company, you have to be strategically patient and tactically impatient.''' ,'''What's different is with every successive year, as we launch a thousand plus features and services, we just have the capabilities to make it easier for the rest of the market to use us.''' ,'''What I did know from having started businesses before Amazon, as well as from my time at Amazon, was that when you are trying to do something new, it's really a waste of energy to spend a lot of cycles wondering whether it's going to be a success or not.''' ,'''It's easy to play it safe, but the reality is that if you want to keep changing the world for customers, which we all want to do, you have to make bets and you have to be willing to fail.''' ,'''Customers or employees are free to shoot me email. I may not respond to every single one because sometimes the numbers are voluminous, but I read them all.''' ,'''The vast majority of companies will not own their own data centers in the fullness of time. All that computing is moving to the cloud. This space is going to be a high-volume, relatively low-margin business.''' ,'''You have to know what your customers think about your product and where you sit, relatively speaking. You have to know what's working and what's not working.''' ,'''I think at the end of the day with any technology, whether you're talking about facial recognition technology or anything else, the people that use the technology have to be responsible for it, and if they use it irresponsibly, they have to be held accountable.''' ,'''You have to know what competitors are doing in your space.''' ,'''We have a large number of people working in AI. If you look around homes and the workplace, there are all these sensors in many devices. This is what people commonly call the Internet of Things.''' ,'''If you know anything about what a lot of the senior leaders at Amazon do in their free time, they spend a lot of time on civil liberties. It's something that's very important to me and I think a lot of my peers.''' ,'''In the case of games, we have a belief that that could end up being the largest category in entertainment over a long period of time. Just look at what's happening in games and how social they've become.''' ,'''When you have a sitting president who's willing to publicly show his disdain for a company and the leader of a company, it's very difficult for government agencies including the DOD to make an objective decision without fear of reprisal.''' ,'''You have got to be maniacal and relentless - relentless and tenacious about getting to the truth.''' ,'''A lot of times in intense moments, you tend to play conservatively because you're just trying to avoid losing, as opposed to trying to win.''' ,'''I mean it's easy to have a website. It's inexpensive to do so, and most of the small businesses have that, but to get access to hundreds of millions of customers is hard.''' ,'''I think that always our focus is gonna be the customers.''' ,'''I think if you have a large group of people like we do - we have 1.2 million employees - it's almost like a small country.''' ,'''You can't just go careening toward your idea without checking in with customers and people who might use it and making sure you're on to something.''' ,'''We're talking about the national security of our country and modernizing their technology platforms and the foundation on which all those applications are going to be used to protect our country. You have to make sure these decisions are made truly objectively.''' ,'''We've led the way in the $15 minimum wage.''' ,'''You know, Amazon as a whole has become - has been successful, and across a few different business segments, but simply because the company's been successful, in a few different business segments, doesn't mean it's somehow too big.''' ,'''Our leadership principles often have tension in them. And I think that's actually a good thing and it makes sense.''' ,'''People ask us a lot about the notion of spinning AWS off. We have no plans to do so. I will never say never, but there's no compelling reason. Amazon has been so generous and gracious in aggressively funding AWS that there's no reason to do it.''' ,'''There are certain jobs where you can just as easily, in some cases more effectively, work remotely. If you take an engineer, for example, when they get into the mode of coding, being on their own where they're not distracted or interrupted is very helpful.''' ,'''When you look at whether a company is a monopoly or not, the first thing you look at is what kind of market segment share they have.''' ,'''If you do any thorough, apples-to-apples, objective comparison of AWS versus Microsoft, you don't come out deciding that they're comparable platforms.''' ,'''I think our relationship with Seattle has had ups and downs frankly.''' ,'''For me, it was valuable just to be able to watch how Jeff operated every day, as well as his leaders and his direct reports.''' ,'''I think you need a leadership team that is absolutely ravenous to get at the truth.''' ,'''A lot of companies really will only pursue businesses that are adjacent or look like an extension of their current business - which by the way is a completely rational strategy.''' ,'''In the past we've tried to hire people in locations where we have critical mass, because we thought it was better for people's career development and easier for them to collaborate. We realized if you have somebody in a particular location who is willing to work the hours to be able to collaborate, you can do it very efficiently.''' ,'''You have to challenge people, often people who know a lot more about a subject than you do.''' ,'''At Amazon, with new initiatives, we don't look at something and say, 'Okay, it needs to hit this certain metric.' Because it's impossible to know whether somebody's going to respond to something really new and innovative.''' ,'''I think it's scary for consumer confidence and for confidence in U.S. businesses and potential credit ratings if we don't make sure that we raise that debt ceiling.''' ,'''Even when we go back to having meetings in person, we will continue to incorporate a lot of the things we learned in virtual meetings to make sure we get the right engagement from all of our remote teammates.''' ,'''A lot of competitors of various Amazon businesses use AWS. We don't view that as a problem. We very consciously want any company, competitor or not, to use our infrastructure to build their business.''' ,'''I think that there are a number of older-guard technology companies who either genuinely believe or are hoping people will believe that companies aren't going to move to the cloud that quickly or that a very large amount of workloads will remain on-premises forever.

But we also had a mental image of a college kid in his dorm room having the same access, the same scalability and same infrastructure costs as the largest businesses in the world.''' ,'''I would say that things like the head tax in Seattle I think are super dangerous for cities to implement. What company is going to want to start - or move to or grow in - a city that penalizes them for hiring full-time employees?''' ,'''When you have a new idea that hasn't been done before, you need that conviction, that blind faith that it could work.''' ,'''Most meetings largely take place in one physical location, and then people plug in remotely. But they are a little bit off to the side; they can't participate in the meeting as fully as you like.''' ,'''If something is going to happen, whether you want it to happen or not, it is going to happen.

You couldn't probably responsibly plan for a pandemic or the amount of capacity that's needed.''' ,'''AWS moves fast, listens to customers, and creates value on top of our already successful cloud-computing infrastructure. We're consistently thinking two to five years forward.''' ,'''It's incredible how passionate people are about having the tools to control their own destiny.''' ,'''You can imagine all the things that people want in machine learning and artificial intelligence area that we're working on, that we'll continue to work on in the future.''' ,'''We've had the facial recognition technology out for use for over two-and-a-half years now, and in those two-and-a-half years, we've never had any reported misuse of law enforcement using the facial recognition technology.''' ,'''There is insatiable demand for AWS cloud services.''' ,'''Before, companies and startups had to lay up all this capital for data centers and servers, and take your scarce resource, which in most companies is engineers, and have them work on the undifferentiated heavy lifting of infrastructure. What the cloud has done is completely flipped that model on its head so that you only pay for what you consume.''' ,'''We started to consider what became Amazon Web Services between 2000 and 2003.''' ,'''We have a lot of people in Seattle, but we also have a lot of people in Bellevue and it is where most of our growth will end up being.''' ,'''If you're flying everyone Business and First Class to meet customers, it's a pretty substantial expense, and none of that benefits customers.''' ,'''We're much more focused on the long term than most companies.''' ,'''You have to have the courage to pull the company up and force them to change and move.''' ,'''Jeff is an incredibly unusual leader who is unbelievably talented and I learned a massive amount.''' ,'''Simply because Amazon decides to pursue a market segment doesn't mean the customers are going to spend their money there, and so it means that we have to do an amazing job in providing a great customer experience that customers want.''' ,'''In our business, you have to be able to have access to capital.''' ,'''It's like a kid opening gifts on Christmas. The people who come to re:Invent are really excited about what the cloud is letting them do.''' ,'''There is no compression algorithm for experience.''' ,'''These are serious problems in all of our major cities: homelessness, education, there are are a number of them. And they require hard thinking and innovative solutions. But I think cities are so better off working with the business community towards joint solutions, rather than trying to tax them.''' ,'''When you experience great voice apps, it makes tapping on an app so circa 2005.''' ,'''We don't think at all about how the AWS business complements the Amazon business from a financial overview perspective.''' ,'''It's not a surprise to us that every large technology company is trying to build an offering like AWS' because it's such a good value proposition for customers.''' ,'''You have to be willing to have failures along the way.''' ,'''During the pandemic in our fulfillment centers, we had a system and a process around people being able to request short and long term leave and the process just didn't scale.''' ,'''Everybody at the company has the freedom - and really, the expectation - to critically look at how it can be better and then invent ways to make it better.''' ,'''Tennis was a particularly interesting growing-up experience. It's actually a difficult way of growing up because it's such an individual sport. It taught me a lot of life lessons that have been helpful later in my life.''' ,'''My suspicion is that a lot of these office buildings will start to evolve from being optimized for individual offices or cube space to being hot offices where you decide which day you're going to come in and then you reserve a desk.''' ,'''If you believe developers will build applications from scratch using web services as primitive building blocks, then the operating system becomes the Internet.''' ,'''In the early 2000s, we were finding at Amazon that software development projects were taking us longer than we thought they should. We decided to build a set of infrastructure services to allow our retail business to move more quickly.''' ,'''Some businesses take off in the first year, and others take many years.''' ,'''Tennis is very much a meritocracy.
