- People know my story - how I started like they did and that I struggled with things, like being a working mom. They ask me things they wouldn't ask anyone else.
- My family owned a furniture/appliance store near Kingston, Jamaica. I worked there all summer but lived in a very structured environment the rest of the year at an all-girl Catholic boarding school.
- I learned that you can accomplish so much, no matter what the limitations may be. You just gotta believe to achieve.
- I just like interacting with people.
- I finish two books a week, mostly nonfiction.
- Honestly, being a store manager was the best job I ever had.
- You have to ask people for help. I wasn't good at that.
- I grew up in Kingston, Jamaica, as the youngest of four children and the only girl. My father died when I was only a year and a half. He was killed in a car accident when he was 26.
- I got a part-time job as a cashier at Home Depot in North Miami Beach on April 1, 1985. I didn't expect to be in retail all my life, but retail was ingrained in me from my grandmother. I enjoyed interacting with people, and I got opportunities.
- I just love to read, learn, and think through complex things.
- Ask people who have the job you want how they got it.
- My grandmother was divorced, and she had 10 children herself. She never finished high school. She started selling lace on the side of the road and then grew that into a multimillion-dollar business - a retail store selling mostly furniture and appliances.
