- That's very important when you're doing an ensemble piece, that you give it a variety of levels so it doesn't get too homogenous.
- I like meeting people from other walks of life and finding out about other worlds, and knowing that I'm fairly adept at one world and really stupid in many others.
- Often when you have less to work with, you do more.
- We all grow.
- The one good thing about dance is that if you are truly yourself, then it's all good.
- Bob was fascinating to watch. It was like being a student of Albert Einstein. This guy was really brilliant, and I got to watch and experience it.
- I learn from teaching. Having to break things down and explain them makes me a better dancer.
- I want people to know I'm a good actress.
- The only thing I don't have is enough time.
- One of the reasons I like to teach is that I like to pass things on. That's an unspoken law of show business.
- The whole gist of 'All That Jazz' is Faustian. It's about a man who sells his soul to show business - which Bob didn't do. He understood the dangers of glamour and falling into that kind of life.
- Bob's work gleaned from hoofing, from vaudeville, from ballet.
- I have a wonderful husband, sportswriter Peter Talbert.
- People always remark on how I'm not as tall as I look in film. I tell them about the time I saw Lassie on a studio lot, and she was this tiny scruffy dog. Film makes you larger than life.
- I'd announced when I was 13 that I wanted to go to New York instead of college - that was quite a disaster, but it gave my parents plenty of time to get conditioned that after finishing school I really was determined.
- I teach jazz dancing and I can be a guest teacher whenever I want.
- I'm happiest with my family and with working.
- You know, theater is either heaven or hell. There's no middle.
- I'm used to things not coming in the packages you expect.
- Bob taught me extraordinary discipline and love.
- 'Dancin' was exceptionally significant. I was in an original Broadway show and nominated for a Tony.
- I was up for parts in 'Charlie's Angels' and 'Three's Company,' but other people got them. At the time I was very disappointed because I knew the shows would be tremendous hits. But if I had done either I would not have done the following: 'Chorus Line,' 'Dancin',' 'Chicago,' 'Movie Movie,' 'All That Jazz' and 'Annie.'
- Students ask me what is the best advice you could give me? And I say, 'Your mother's right.'
- I wanted a way to pass on all the gifts, all the instruction that I've been given.
- There's a lot of heart to Bob's work that doesn't always get recognized because of all of the sensuality, dark statements and wit of his work.
- I think if you push to get to know somebody, it's not a natural evolution.
- Something can be said for quitting for a little while. You can get completely drained as a performer and creator. You have to fill back up.
- The reason why I believe faith is important for a person is that it teaches you to trust.
- I tend to be loyal to the people who have been loyal to me.
- You have no control over how tall you are or how long your legs are, but you do have control over how much you concentrate.
- Michael Bennett, Tommy Tune and Agnes de Mille fought to be director-choreographers. They were just not going to do it any other way because the choreographer is so often at the bottom of the creative totem pole when you put a show together. So with that power you get a more direct point-of-view and that helps something called style.
- The hope is that in rediscovering 'Chicago,' audiences will rediscover what theater was. It was sophisticated, complicated, adult.
- I wanted to have children.
- I had a small speaking part in 'Coco.' Katharine Hepburn said to me, 'You can act.' Wasn't that nice?
- It's hard to dance after a certain age. All those athletic things - like looking up at my kneecaps - they're just not there anymore.
- I remember telling my dad, 'I'm working 14- to 16-hour days and I don't care. I can't wait to get back to work.'
- People think I'm accident-prone when they see me on crutches, but I do eight shows a week.
- Bob was very influenced by Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill. That huge type of creativity which takes nothing and makes it into something very wrenching.
- Fosse would say that it's important to trust silence. He very much liked the use of the tacit, or silent, count, where nothing is happening. He also liked percussion. His is a world of angular movement and mystery, quiet, semi-taciturn and percussive.
- Dance saves lives.
- The joy is in the work. The travel is the dues you pay.
- When you get too much, too quickly, too easily, you don't learn to fight.
- Ingenue parts are plentiful. And once you get old, they'll start hiring you again for character parts. But the middle years are tough.
- Once Bob commits to something, it's almost like a child. He doesn't want anybody else to take care of it, even if it might be to his detriment.
- Every great dancer has so much to offer.
- You can always work around this, that or the other, but if everybody's in there because they love it and they just want to do it the best they can, that's an ideal situation that you don't always get.
- Creativity is not a mysterious thing, it's a historical thing.
- You have to have tunnel vision as a dancer to get to where you're going. But once you get there, you have to save yourself by spreading your horizons. It's the paradox of this profession. The very thing that makes you very good will destroy you.
- Acting, like wine, gets better as time goes on. Singing gets better after a certain age. The dancer peaks at 35 or 40.
- One of the things that made Bob so unique and wonderful is that he had a genuine style, like Balanchine, like de Mille.
- Herb was a great husband.
- People forget that the same man who did 'Star 80' and 'All that Jazz' also did 'Pardon Me Miss But I've Never Been Kissed.'
- It's a good idea to have your career intact and then have children.
- I think it's hard to live without some sort of faith.
- Mr Fosse was obviously influenced by Brecht and Weill, as well as Bergman and Fellini, and you could see the influence of vaudeville and African American hoofing - and Fred Astaire, too.
- You can't stand still in one spot, no matter how good it is. You have to do something new, keep trying. That's everything.
- I would love to be proud of my life, to look back and say, I did a good job, that I strive for quality.
- One of the good things about accomplishing something is that it helps your self-image of yourself.
- Broadway is so defeating for the most part that it doesn't encourage people to be as tenacious as they should be.
- I loved 'Cabaret.' I loved what it had to say and the whole style and brilliance of the book. It was my first time performing Fred Ebb and John Kander's work. They took risks. Even when their shows are fun and funny, they are about very serious issues.
- The Fosse technique really does have to have a delicacy and an elegance to it.
- In sixth grade my teacher said that we had to do a talent show. You could sing or recite a poem... I went a wrote a little sketch for myself called 'Our Big World' about how many ways you could use a scarf.
- If you can't trust, it's harder to love and if you can't love it's harder to be happy.
- I came to New York with $500. That was a lot of money because my allowance was 50 cents.
- I love doing concert choreography because everything is about your vision, come heck or high water. Of course, you also take the blame for everything, but it's wonderful to be able to make up dance for dance's sake.
- In theatre or in ballet, the ballerina always passes on what they know. It's a hands-on craft. You can't really learn the soul and the pathos of it if you just see a video. It has to be taught by someone who is in the know.
- When I did 'Goodtime Charley' that helped a great deal, but 'Dancin' was such a huge hit. It catapulted me in to being a consistent principal to count on.
- Once a star... No matter what, there's something there, they give you something that's special.
- Dance is such a wonderful, universal expression, even if the bugle beads are wrong.
- All great directors - however, they do it - make you want to be good. I hope I do it. It's like being a parent, a psychiatrist, a disciplinarian and a friend.
- I ripped both hamstrings.
- Bob was beloved by people, very intelligent people, for their entire lives, and he had tremendous loyalty from everyone. I know he has a reputation for being abusive, but he's not.
- You get to a certain point in your life and you think you can do it all. And then you do do it all, and then you have to top yourself.
- To tell you the truth, I see any revolution as basically a penmanship exercise. It all loops around and winds up where you started.
- Chorus Line' opened things up a bit. Any show that's successful does that. But 'Chorus Line' was about dancers.
- Working with people who have a lot of heart is just the best. You can hire it, but you cannot teach it. It's either there or it's not.
- When you're a teenager, you don't want to look different. So being very tall can set you apart, not being able to see very well can set you apart... and you just want to fit in. We all do.
- I always had my feet in two places when I was doing amateur dance in Seattle.
- You can't force kids on people.
- I like to stretch myself, and playing a dance-hall hostess is quite a stretch, but I feel comfortable with it.
- It was sad to leave 'Pippin' because it was a kind of inspirational turning point in my life. But it was time to move on.
- For theater I am like a long-distance runner. For movies I am a sprinter! Same playing field, different approach.
- I put all my energy and thoughtful commitment to everything that I do. There is no other way!
- I would not correct dancers if I was performing, because I don't believe in performers correcting other performers.
- The odd thing about Bob is that even though he's known as really taking chances and being very sensual, he was also a very moral man.
- It's to your advantage to work your brain as well as your body. The rest is up to fate.
- Dancing is the personification of music, and music is an abstract expression of the human spirit. But still it's the act of communication, of making one feel. Otherwise it would just be gymnastics.
- If you're a woman and you're working, you're already set up for conflict.
- I announced at the dinner table when I was 11 that I wanted to be a ballet dancer. But my goal changed to musical theater after the choreographer Robert Joffrey saw me perform while I was on scholarship at the San Francisco Ballet School.
- To meet someone who you look up to like they are gods and goddesses, sometimes that person can disappoint you a bit.
- Show dancing stood very well on its own a long time ago with dancers like Bill Robinson and Marilyn Miller.
- Every step is basically a word, especially with musical theatre, because you're not doing it for dance's sake, you're promoting a story - and, more than that, a moral. You're propelling a story.
- I enjoy YouTube like everyone else.
- Pippin' was, I guess you can say, the break that everyone needs and you hope that you have the talent to back up the opportunity.
- I think of myself, basically, as a very practical person in black bugle beads.
- For 'Chicago,' the dancers need to demonstrate an affinity for the Fosse style. Sometimes dancers come in with brilliant technique, but if the Fosse style isn't easy for them, or it's awkward for them, they won't be right for this show.
- It's highly collaborative, musical theater, so everybody has got to somehow get along.
- The human spirit is the greatest thing on earth.
- It's all cyclical. Sometimes things just come in packs. At one point you had this collection of great choreographers where you would see eight bars and you would know definitely who did it.
- The guest artists pass on not only their experiences but also the pitfalls.
