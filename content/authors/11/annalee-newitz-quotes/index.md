quotes = ['''Once you've worked as a writer and editor in the world of social media for a decade, the way I have, you start to notice patterns.''' ,'''In the 1970s, as historians became enchanted with microhistories, economists were expanding the reach of their discipline. Nations, states and cities began to plan for the future by consulting with economists whose prognostications were shaped by investment cycles rather than historical ones.''' ,'''Watching 'Interstellar' is really like watching two movies slowly collide with each other.''' ,'''Max Brooks' novel 'World War Z' is one of the greatest zombie stories ever written, partly for reasons that make it basically unfilmable.''' ,'''Unlike economics, whose sole preoccupation in our finance-obsessed era is the near-term profit motive, history offers a way to place our tiny lifespans in a narrative that spans dozens of generations - perhaps even reaching into a future where capitalism is no longer our dominant form of economic organization.''' ,'''There can be problems with extended families, and it can get a little close for comfort. But for the younger generations, it's clear that this option is becoming almost as appealing as living alone.''' ,'''A group of scientists wanted to find the most effective mosquito repellents. So they tested 10 different substances, including campout standbys like DEET, as well as a random choice: Victoria's Secret perfume Bombshell. Turns out the perfume is almost as good as DEET.''' ,'''Economic systems rise and fall just like empires. That's the kind of perspective we need to take if we hope to prosper for centuries rather than for the next quarter.''' ,'''I think a lot of us responded intensely to 'True Detective' because it was so incredibly earnest. That's what made it heartbreaking and involving.''' ,'''To understand the future properly, it's crucial that we listen to geologists as often as we do computer scientists.''' ,'''The U.N.'s current projection is that humanity will number 9.3 billion individuals in 2050 and then hit 10.1 billion by 2100. Meanwhile, our energy resources are dwindling, and droughts threaten our food supplies.''' ,'''Back in the 1980s, you could learn how to add memory cards to your PC in a Radio Shack.''' ,'''The myth that young people should leave the nest at 18, never to return, started with iconic American Benjamin Franklin.''' ,'''Put simply, 'Interstellar' has a strong undercurrent of cheesiness.''' ,'''Turning a zombie pandemic into a generic disaster movie robs the zombies of their dirty, nasty edginess and robs the disaster of its epic scope.''' ,'''Whether 'Avatar' is racist is a matter for debate. Regardless of where you come down on that question, it's undeniable that the film - like alien apartheid flick 'District 9', released earlier this year - is emphatically a fantasy about race.''' ,'''There is evidence that we are headed into what would be the planet's sixth mass extinction. It's hard to know for sure if you're in one because a mass extinction is an event where over 75 percent of the species on the planet die out over a - usually about a million-year period. The fastest it might happen is in hundreds of thousands of years.''' ,'''The first time I saw 'Star Wars,' I got so excited that I threw up.''' ,'''You are ruled by change whether you like it or not, and io9's future path lies with joining a larger site that covers technology as well as science and science fiction.''' ,'''Reader was by far the most popular feed reader out there, and its user base had been in a steep decline for two years before Google decided to shut it down.''' ,'''When I was a policy analyst at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, I became obsessed with end user license agreements.''' ,'''At last we've seen the first installment of Joss Whedon's new web series, 'Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog,' and it's sweeter than we'd ever imagined.''' ,'''Using predictive models from engineering and public health, designers will plan safer, healthier cities that could allow us to survive natural disasters, pandemics, and even a radiation calamity that drives us underground.''' ,'''People who gentrify are usually new transplants to a city, changing it to suit their particular cultural needs and whims.''' ,''''Interstellar' is a thematic sequel to Christopher Nolan's last original film, 'Inception'. It drops us into a dark future full of otherworldly landscapes and time distortions.''' ,'''If outsider perspectives made 'Lord of the Rings' and 'Dark Knight' into fantastic franchises, imagine what would happen if you brought in the perspectives of women and people of color.''' ,'''A series of studies in the 1990s and 2000s revealed that as women gained more access to education, jobs, and birth control, they had fewer children. As a result, developed countries in western Europe, Japan, and the Americas were seeing zero or negative population growth.''' ,''''Avatar' imaginatively revisits the crime scene of white America's foundational act of genocide, in which entire native tribes and civilizations were wiped out by European immigrants to the American continent.''' ,'''To share a story is in part to take ownership of it, especially because you are often able to comment on a story that you are sharing on social media.''' ,'''Cities are not static objects to be feared or admired, but are instead a living process that residents are changing all the time.''' ,'''Technological change is both familiar and easy to observe.''' ,'''Critics have called alien epic 'Avatar' a version of 'Dances With Wolves' because it's about a white guy going native and becoming a great leader. But Avatar is just the latest scifi rehash of an old white guilt fantasy.''' ,'''When you consider that our technology has advanced from the first telephones to smart phones in roughly a century, it's easy to understand why it seems like tomorrow is arriving faster than it ever did.''' ,'''You've probably heard the stories about how io9 got its name.

And thus, RSS was born.''' ,'''Before the 21st century, stories became popular because people talked about them in other publications or shared magazine and newspaper clippings with friends.''' ,''''The Red' is the first book in a trilogy that gained a big following as a self-published e-book, and is now out in paper from Saga. It introduces us to reluctant hero Shelley, a former anti-war activist who chooses to join the military rather than serve jail time after being arrested at a protest.''' ,'''If we lose bees, we may be looking at losing apples and oranges. We may be looking at losing a great deal of other crops, as well, and other animals that depend on those crops.''' ,'''Science fiction is exciting because it promises to show the world and the universe from perspectives radically unlike what we've seen before.''' ,'''What can we expect from this latest crop of indie directors who have been sucked into the franchise factory? I'm especially curious about 'Star Wars,' which will feature an all-indie crew after J. J. Abrams finishes with 'Episode VII.'''' ,'''Suddenly, all the giant Hollywood franchises are being driven by alternative filmmakers.''' ,'''We're seeing a new 'Gilded Age,' where inheritance is a deciding factor in who becomes the wealthiest.''' ,'''Humans have continued to evolve quite a lot over the past ten thousand years, and certainly over 100 thousand.

So we are warming the planet up.''' ,'''Publishers often push women in a subtle way to focus on fantasy and paranormal writing.''' ,'''A hard-hitting investigative report that uncovers a nugget of genuine truth is the ultimate viral hit.''' ,'''In the 1920s and 30s, when Radio Shack was young, a much earlier generation of nerds swarmed into these tiny shops to talk excitedly about building radios and other transmission devices. You might say that Radio Shack helped define gadget culture for four generations, from radio whizzes up to smartphone dorks.''' ,'''Evolution, climate change, and the construction of the physical universe down to its atoms are processes that we measure in millions or billions of years.''' ,'''When I was a lecturer at UC Berkeley, I wrote a book about monsters.''' ,'''I am a big proponent of character arcs that show us how people change over time.''' ,'''As fears about the energy and environmental crises reach a fever pitch, we're all searching for solutions. And one possibility is that we could fix everything if we'd just shrink our population back down to about 2 billion people - which would put us roughly where we were at 80 years ago.''' ,'''When it comes to the population explosion, there are two questions on the table.

But then something changed, and we began making decisions based on economic principles rather than historical ones. The results were catastrophic.''' ,'''In many cities, it's become popular to hate 'gentrifiers,' rich people who move in and drive up housing prices - pushing everyone else out.''' ,'''I founded io9 back in 2008, and I watched it journey from the farthest reaches of space to its current home under this atmosphere bubble on Ceres.''' ,'''We can celebrate how far we've come from our sexist past when women and men are equally represented in the pages of science fiction anthologies.''' ,'''The novel 'World War Z' is told from the perspectives of so many people - speaking to the narrator - that there's no way a movie could capture all of them. Still, the idea of turning a zombie pandemic into a war story is fascinating and could have translated easily to film.''' ,'''io9 was the last standalone site that Gawker Media ever launched. It was born at a time when many of the company's other famous sites, from Consumerist and Wonkette to Fleshbot and Idolator, were being sold off or shuttered.''' ,'''We sometimes allow writers to publish their work without editing on io9.''' ,'''Evolutionary psychology has often been a field whose most prominent practitioners get embroiled in controversy - witness the 2010 case of Harvard professor Marc Hauser, whose graduate students came forward to say he'd been faking evidence for years.''' ,'''Cities might become biological entities, walls hung with curtains of algae that glow at night and sequester carbon, and floors made from tweaked cellular material that strengthens like bones as we walk on it.''' ,''''The Red' delivers intense action, leavened by a genuinely sympathetic portrait of soldiers caught up in battles they never chose.''' ,'''Your fragile mind can't have forgotten the terrifying technothriller series known 'Scorpion'. Because it features the worst hacking scenes ever broadcast in any medium.''' ,'''Women are being welcomed into science fiction, but it's through the back door.''' ,'''When I was a journalist at Wired, I convinced a doctor to implant an RFID tracking device in my arm.''' ,]
