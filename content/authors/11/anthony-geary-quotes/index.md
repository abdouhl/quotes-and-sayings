- I was a terrific liar as a child, and I believe my lies. So it's a natural step into acting.
- I usually get up not before 9. I have a huge library - I'm a big fan of Scandinavian crime fiction - so I'll usually take a book and go off to one of my favorite bistros for a cappuccino or espresso or maybe I'll have some lovely smoked salmon for breakfast.
- Usually, new producers and writers want to put their stamp on a show. They don't want to continue what's working. They want to reinvent the wheel. It's an ego thing.
- I worked with Dalton Trumbo, who served time for refusing to give up names of people that were accused of being Communists. I've always admired him.
- People say 'Why would you learn Dutch? Nobody speaks it. Why not French?' Even the Dutch say that to me! I say because I want to live here, I think it's only common courtesy that I speak the language.
- I've always said, I prefer the opera to the soap - those extreme characters and circumstances.
- In soaps, people come back from the dead all the time, to the point where death is just a bus stop.
- I have friends in France who are artists. I go to gallery openings and things like that.
- They do not air 'GH' in Holland, so I don't get recognized. But the Dutch are wonderfully unimpressed with celebrity, so even if the show did play over there it probably wouldn't affect things much. It's a wonderful life and I am so blessed.
