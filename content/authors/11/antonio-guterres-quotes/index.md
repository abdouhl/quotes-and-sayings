quotes = ['''The United Nations must focus on delivery rather than process and on people rather than bureaucracy.''' ,'''As a global community, we face a choice. Do we want migration to be a source of prosperity and international solidarity, or a byword for inhumanity and social friction?''' ,'''The future is unpredictable.''' ,'''I must say I have a personal love affair with India, with its civilisation, its culture.''' ,'''It's widely recognized that there is no peace without development and no development without peace; it is also true that there is no peace and sustainable development without respect for human rights.''' ,'''Our world faces many grave challenges: Widening conflicts and inequality. Extreme weather and deadly intolerance. Security threats - including nuclear weapons. We have the tools and wealth to overcome these challenges. All we need is the will.''' ,'''Nowhere in the world has the use of force alone resolved a conflict.''' ,'''The twenty-first century will be characterized by the mass movement of people being pushed and pulled within and beyond their borders by conflict, calamity, or opportunity.''' ,'''Climate change is moving faster than we are, but we don't give up because we know that climate action is the only path.''' ,'''The United Nations needs to be nimble, efficient, and effective.''' ,'''There is never a humanitarian solution for a humanitarian crisis. The solutions for the humanitarian crisis are always political ones.''' ,'''If resources become scarce, people tend to fight for them. This is increasing the number of people on the move and the number of people forced to move. They're not refugees, according to the legal definition, but they represent a major humanitarian and human rights challenge, as well as a major challenge for world politics.''' ,'''We live in a... chaotic world.''' ,'''I do believe that the international community cannot act based on a rivalries or things of that sort.''' ,'''Terrorist groups share an agenda of authoritarianism, misogyny, and intolerance. They are an affront to the common values encapsulated in the U.N.

Our oceans are a mess.''' ,'''One of the problems with the Security Council is that there are vetoes, and they do not allow us to do what might be justified from the point of view of sanctions.''' ,'''All Bangladeshi citizens, including minorities and women, must feel safe and confident in exercising their right to vote.''' ,'''When counterterrorist policies are used to suppress peaceful protests and legitimate opposition movements, shut down debate, target human rights defenders, or stigmatize minorities, they fail, and we all lose. Indeed, such responses may cause further resentment and instability and contribute to radicalization.''' ,'''Conflicts are multiplying - people are suffering. But we don't give up, because we know every man, woman, and child deserves a life of peace.''' ,'''We have to transcend our differences to transform our future.''' ,'''India is a country that has no direct interests in some areas of global conflict. It has very good relations with countries in conflict or countries facing difficult security situations, and I believe Indian diplomacy is very well received. India is a bridge-builder, an honest broker, and a messenger of peace.''' ,'''As we face the headwinds of our troubled and turbulent times, let us always be inspired by the legacy of Kofi Annan - and guided by the knowledge that he will continue speaking to us, urging us on toward the goals to which he dedicated his life and truly moved our world.''' ,'''When we see so many conflicts multiplying, the only way to allow the international community to be able to address those conflicts, the only way to allow the international community to act boldly, is with unity of the countries of the region, able to serve together and in the same universal principles.''' ,'''Terrorism is a persistent and evolving global menace.

Charter.''' ,'''Plastic waste is now found in the most remote areas of the planet. It kills marine life and is doing major harm to communities that depend on fishing and tourism.''' ,'''Denying the rights of women and girls is not only wrong in itself; it has a serious social and economic impact that holds us all back.''' ,'''Since the shock of former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan's death, I have been reflecting on what made him so special. To my mind, it is simply this: Kofi Annan was both one of a kind and one of us.''' ,'''It's true that globalization, with all its fantastic improvements in the world and the technological progress linked to it, has increased inequality at country level, especially inside countries. And there are people that were left behind - people, sectors, regions - that has created a sense of frustration in the rust belts of the world.''' ,'''I am totally committed to the cooperation between the African Union and the United Nations.''' ,'''World Migratory Bird Day is an opportunity to celebrate the great natural wonder of bird migration - but also a reminder that those patterns, and ecosystems worldwide, are threatened by climate change.''' ,'''Clearly, the response to terrorism and violent extremism must respect human rights and comply with international law.

There are no political reasons that justify it; there is no cause, no grievance that justifies it. And we will do everything possible to make sure that all countries of the world understand that.''' ,'''One of the most frustrating things is to see a country in which you had elections, the elections were a success, but then you have to say to people nothing can be improved in the next few months, even in the next few years, in infrastructure, in water, in sanitation, in health, in education, in jobs.''' ,'''When you look at human rights, look at gender, and the rights of girls for education in the world - that are crucial issues - some are saying 'Oh, these are western values.'

Diversity is a strength, not a weakness.''' ,'''The humanitarian aid system is built on a concept that when disaster strikes, outside agencies provide a temporary helping hand until people can take back control of their own lives. But across the world, we see millions of people caught in semi-permanent crises. As each year goes by, they are less and less likely to break free.''' ,'''A refugee in the traditional vision is someone who flees from country to another because of persecution or conflict.

During the 2011 refugee crises, it was obvious that people were fleeing Somalia and Libya - there was a lot of international attention. Statelessness goes undetected because stateless people are in legal limbo and are afraid to show up.''' ,'''Violence against women is fundamentally about power.''' ,'''Global coherence demands a permanent strategic cooperation culture at all levels.''' ,'''In a world where the latest app can sell for billions of dollars, there are plenty of ways to provide a minimum of humanity for those caught in conflict, who never had the opportunity to reach their potential in the first place.''' ,'''Negative gender stereotypes related to girls' education in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics begin as early as primary school and have the devastating effect of making them doubt their own potential.''' ,'''China can be a guarantor to North Korea that if they give up their nuclear capacity, the United States will not be in a position to harm them. And for the United States, China can also be a guarantor that if there is an agreement, that the agreement is effectively implemented by the North Koreans.''' ,'''When I was growing up reading history books as a young student, it seemed all wars had a winner.

Charter: peace, justice, respect, human rights, tolerance, and solidarity.''' ,'''When I look at the web, it's clear that the web is a fantastic instrument for all of us. It's clear that we have the dark web and the deep web and all the problems of cybersecurity, etc. And the question of regulation is a very complex question in relation to this.''' ,'''I am a multilateralist. I am deeply convinced that there is no other way to deal with global challenges than with global responses, and organised in a multilateral way.''' ,'''Preventing conflict means going back to basics - strengthening institutions and building resilient societies.''' ,'''Our world needs to move from managing crises to preventing them in the first place.
