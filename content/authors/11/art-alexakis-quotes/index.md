- I like older people; I think older people have a lot of flavor.
- Being a musician, especially at the major label where you work for so long, it becomes a cycle. Write a record, make a record, tour. It's just this cycle, and I don't think there's any life built into it with time to assimilate what's going on in front of you and what's going on in your head.

- Success to me is being able to do what I love, make a living at it and to support myself and the ones I love.

- About one or two songs per record is me doing a little bloodletting.
