- Your record is where you've been, but it's not necessarily where you are or where you're going. That just shows that I've had a tough road.
- Conor knows how to fight and he knows how to box. He has been boxing professional boxers for his whole life, he has had almost 50 amateur boxing fights.
- What Aldo is good at is the leg kicks, that's what oppened a lot of doors for him. He would land those leg kicks, and then the shot would come from there, but in terms of his hands, he doesn't have, I mean he has power, of course he does, but nowhere near the power that I have, I promise you that.

- The thing everybody thinks of when they think about Russia is how tough the people are. When they see a fighter continuously pulling out, that's something that they really don't like.

And I never got bullied in my life, even though I changed to five secondary schools in three different countries.
- Obviously UFC was one of those kind of dreams that we weren't sure if we were ever going to reach, so for us, the biggest belt was the Cage Contender belt.
- Being able to train nothing but boxing for a full year made me a much better boxer as I brought in professional boxers helped me make a lot of gains.

- For me it's my biggest sporting achievement being Conor McGregor's sparring partner.
- Artur Sowinksi is a fight that I want to put right for a long time - that win was stolen from me. His friend was the promoter, a Polish promoter at the time and he overturned it, but that's a win in my mind - it was a win that was stolen from me.

- To me, KSW is a huge promotion and it's on my list of one of the things I want to do as an MMA fighter. I think that goes for any European fighter.

- Honestly, I'm destroying people in sparring, but for some reason I haven't been able to show my full potential in the UFC.
- With the kind of power that I have - no one hits as hard as I do in the featherweight division.
- I'd be lying if I didn't tell you that money was a big factor in signing for Bare Knuckle - we're prize fighters, and our success is measured by the size of our purse.
- I have my reasons to fight every single guy on the UFC roster.
- Whenever someone has an unorthodox approach, different to what a standard boxer would look like, they write it off as being bad. They never seem to look at the normal approach to boxing and think that it might be slightly outdated.

- My attitude is that I just never give up. I've been choked out twice and had my arm broken in a fight but I've never tapped.
- I feel Alex White is exactly the type of guy I always talk about, with an undeserved, padded record. There's many, many of them in the UFC, because this is the easy way in.
- There is such a thing as building a fight, that's no problem, we're going into fight each other. That takes certain levels of intensity that you have to have. You're going in there to hurt the guy and he's going to do the same to you so that's understandable.
- This isn't a very manly thing to do, not showing up for a fight.
- The Irish and Russian communities are huge in New York, so this is truly one of the only places where I can fight in front of all of my fans.
- What do you call success in our sport? What determines success? Are you successful if you are 10-0 and no one is watching your fights? Is that success?

- Many MMA fighters have tried boxing before, even just sparring for a few rounds, but no boxer has done MMA rounds. There's just no way for them to do that.

- Whether it's in the UFC or elsewhere, you need to be winning in this sport.
- When you fight someone, it's different. It's a lot of conflict that you can have. Once you fought somebody, that's it. There's not much to it anymore. You went in there, you settled it like men, one on one, and that's it. After that, I don't think there's really a point to kind of carry it with you, any of that negativity.
- When you ask to go to some other country and fight their local best guy, and you know the judges are going to be his friend and the referee is going to be his coach, the head of commission guys is probably going to be his relative or something like that, and you're asked to do that for 100 Euros. Nobody wants to do that.
- It might seem that way, but getting hit with a bare knuckle is not as raw as getting hit with a bare knee, or getting kicked with a shin to your head, which I have been a few times. In that sense, it's nothing.
- I think against Cub I get it done. He comes in, he's very open, he throws wild shots, and he has never, I promise you, in his life felt power that I have.
- Guys don't want to take hard fights, they avoid any challenges, they take the easiest fights and then they get rewarded with a UFC contract. That's not right, that should never happen that way.
- If people are watching your fights and they care about what you do then that is success to me. As far as I'm concerned, I am one of the most successful fighters in the world.
- When you don't have to worry about the financial side, you can truly concentrate on the craft. You can truly concentrate on the fights you really want to have. You have that freedom and it's extremely important especially when you have a family and you have to provide.

- This is the fight game, sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.
- I honestly feel that Khabib is as big as he is in Russia because of Conor McGregor.
- I absolutely love the fight game.
- Get a boxer and get him wrestling for a minute or two - the arms get so heavy, filled with blood, they can't even hold them up any more, they can't box.
- I always seek the biggest challenge and MMA is the biggest challenge.
- I always seek the highest challenge, the biggest challenge.

- I want to be able to take fights on short notice.
- I'm a true fighter. No one will ever make me quit.
- There's a reason why MMA is only three five-minute rounds, or five fives when it's a title fight. MMA is so much more demanding on the body - the wrestling, the changing levels, all that takes a lot out of you. Boxing is a breeze for us after MMA.
- I said this before, for me I will always respect the fighter that shows up.
- Any of the shows I've ever fought on, they always want to have me back because I always have the fight of the night performance.
- Let's be honest here - 99 percent of MMA fans haven't got a clue what's going on. They don't understand the game enough to comment on any of that. They don't know how easy it is to have an impressive record. I could have 10 guys in my gym tomorrow, beat them all up, and there's 10 wins for my record. It is that easy. It is that easy to be 10-0.
- I truly love fighting, so how can there be pressure for me when I absolutely love it?
- I was not released by the UFC.
- I think there is a big difference between real people and Internet people. Real life people understand that this is a sport.
- They should bring up my record, and call it the fighter bible. The warrior bible. All those guys with padded records should read it everyday, and they should put my picture on their wall as the Jesus Christ of MMA.

- Boxers are absolute novices in the clinch.
- I always make sure that I'm good to do business with.
- Don't get me wrong, I'm very thankful for UFC.
- For me, when someone is able to beat me, that's the guy that I want to spar with.
- I pride myself on having the most exciting fights ever.
- I certainly will explore all avenues. K-1, boxing, all of them.
- When I was in the UFC I challenged some of the biggest guys in the world. When I was fighting in Europe I did the same.
- I've never been a big fan of jewellery or any of the shiny stuff, I just want to fight.
- I want to fight everyone. Weight makes no difference when it comes to who I want to fight.
- I want to be able to take fights across multiple sports and one of the main reasons is I really want the Tukhugov fight. I want to be able to accept that should that call come.
- I've said it before, me and Conor are very, very good friends, and he's certaintly helped me get into the UFC, you know, it is what it is, it makes no difference.
