- Supermarkets don't really sustain a community, and they completely remove people from the food chain.
- I'm a chef, I'm a cook, I was created by this industry, and I like to think I'm giving back. But I'm not giving back because I can make a scallop souffle, I'm giving back because I can make compost.
