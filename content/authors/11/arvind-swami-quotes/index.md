- My daughter criticizes me constructively. She gives me good and honest feedback.
- I was born and raised up in a small farm.
- I have plans of becoming a director soon. I just finished my script. I don't know when I'll direct the film. It is ready and has reached its third draft.
- I have nurtured my kids by myself. I am happy that I invested those 10 years in bringing up my kids.
- While dealing with kids, it's very important to talk to them about what they would like to do.
- I have done my fair share of good roles in unsuccessful films. There's no point in that.
- When I joined films, I was clueless about the industry and had no aspirations to be an actor.
- While bringing up my kids I had to strike a balance between being strict and being able to maintain my cool.
- Stardom doesn't appeal to me in anyway. Of course, I want people to like my work, but in my mind I've consciously created a line where I don't think of myself as a big star.
- For me, whatever I do, I believe, I must do it seriously and invest a lot of time to understand and learn.
- I don't expect people to know my name. I don't get offended if people don't know me.

- I'm in this profession because of Mani Ratnam. He was the one who brought me here. He taught me everything. And he inspired me to make a comeback.
- By nature, I am very curious. I don't think it's fair for anybody to keep your ideas bottled up out of fear. I take a lot of inputs from others. Whether I use them or not is a different issue.
- From 'Thani Oruvan', I've decided that I will work only in films where people accept me as a team member. I can't think of ideas that I feel will improve the film and just keep them to myself.
- I just want to be myself. I want to act in films and not expect any special treatment. I carry my own bags on sets, I don't have assistants around me.
- I now have the experience of life and all I've seen. I came in when I was in my twenties and I wasn't prepared to be an actor. Then there was my sabbatical, my accident and I was single-parenting my kids. Your mind expands, you become mature and you feel liberated. I don't care about being conventional. I want to be daring.
- I had no intention of being an actor in the first place. But it all started when I was 20, and by the time I was 28, it was stifling me.
- At 29, I quit films. A lot of things happened. I had personal issues, injured my spine, and felt paralysed for a while. I never thought of coming back. Personally, it was traumatic. I just took life as it came and dealt with it in a positive manner.
- I have a learning disability when it comes to languages, I envy actors like Prakash Raj and my kids who do it with such ease.
- I can't watch formulaic films and hence, won't write or make one such film.
