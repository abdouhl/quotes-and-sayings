quotes = ['''I've come through it and seen people in football that are sharks. They are ones to stay away from.''' ,'''As players, we have to concentrate with what happens on the pitch, not off it.''' ,'''I love playing football, and that's all I'm going to do.''' ,'''I am one of those players who has many scars up and down my legs from being kicked, but I know I have a job to do, and beating my opponent is my goal.''' ,'''I was at Watford and got a knock-back when I was 16 and didn't get a YTS contract. They said I could find another club or go in and train three times a week after school. I'd been there since I was 10, so I got my head down and proved them wrong. Within a year, they had signed me up, and I haven't looked back.''' ,'''I've played at a European Championship; to represent your country at a World Cup is every boy's dream, and for me, it would definitely be a dream come true.''' ,'''People saying I dive doesn't affect me at all. Not one bit.''' ,'''There are a lot of players competing for that wide attacking role, and if I'm brutally honest, if you aren't playing regularly, you can't get picked.

He always tells me but it just goes over my head.''' ,'''Everything that moved, I was kicking it. You can ask my mum and dad. A stone, a can, whatever.''' ,'''I follow tennis, and I actually went to Wimbledon during the summer, and it was nice to get a day off during pre-season to watch it. Basketball as well - I don't have a team; it's just a casual interest - especially when the play-offs come around and the intensity rises.''' ,'''I think age is just a number - if you are young enough, you are old enough - as long as you are good enough, age shouldn't come into it.''' ,'''I'm not one of those players who talks about things off the field. It's about what trophies and titles and cups you've won.''' ,'''We've got to rediscover the Manchester United way of playing, and I don't think many teams enjoy their nights at Old Trafford when we're on song.''' ,'''I've always had to fight. Throughout my life, it's been a fight to get to where I am now.''' ,'''I'm not a cheat. I'm not a diver.''' ,'''It's up to me to use my brain, be clever, find the pockets of space, and get on the ball.''' ,'''I've always said that when you pull on an England shirt, it's a proud moment, and it's an honour to play for and represent your country.''' ,'''It's just determination, working hard, and keeping my feet on the ground in training and keep on proving people wrong.''' ,'''I can play in six different positions where managers can trust me.

So I started using my brain to overcome those weaknesses and discovered football isn't just about size or power: it's about what's up there. That was the making of me.''' ,'''Once you look back on your career when it's over, you can say, 'This is what I achieved,' or, 'This is what I'm driving.'''' ,'''As you get older, you start to read the game more, and as your brain starts working more, and as you get a good footballing brain, your legs start slowing down!''' ,'''I was 11 years old and was racially abused on the pitch. It was obviously disappointing to hear it at such a young age.''' ,'''If I've gone to get a takeaway, and I get chips... I like to match up the chips in length. That is actually quite weird. Obviously, if I've got chips, I pick them out in twos. That's a weird thing as well.

Never say die.''' ,'''A lot's been said about me playing for three different managers.''' ,'''I've always said, when you join a club like United, it's a tough place to play at.

A lot of people will keep saying I'm a different person, especially when I go across those white lines. I think it's just the hunger and desire and passion I've got for the game.''' ,'''I'll relish playing at Wembley in a major cup final.
