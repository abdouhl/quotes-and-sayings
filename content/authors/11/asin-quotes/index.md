- 'Housefull' was an enjoyable film, and I thought it would be nice to be part of the franchise.

- Even before I entered the industry, my parents always told me never let success get to your head and failure to your heart.

- Apart from English, I speak my mother tongue Malayalam, as well as Tamil, Telugu, and a bit of Kannada and French.
- It feels great to see the kind of love people showered on me when I was shooting for 'London Dreams' in Chandigarh. It was overwhelming and touching. That was when I realised the kind of fan following I have.
- I am tired of starring in those films where I am being a part just for the sake of it.
- I am extremely passionate about reading and like to read about anything and everything under the sun.
- I act because I enjoy it. I give 200 per cent to it.

- No matter how much we deny it, the fact remains that we have a male-dominated society as well as industry.
- I have been accused of many crimes. A TV channel even put up a show called 'Sins of Asin!'
- I was always fond of books right since my childhood days. Even as a teenager, books were my company. Not that I did not have friends, but books kept my occupied most of the time.
- Salman is a paradox. He has this image of a moody actor who turns up late for shoots or doesn't turn up at all. And then there is this image of him as a kind-hearted, loving, and giving man. From my experience with him, I have to say that I have never seen the bad boy image at all.
- When you are new and working with senior artists, it is their responsibility to make you comfortable.
- I am happy that most of my films did good business and either set or broke records at the box office.

- I have no issues with any co-star of mine, male or female.
- I feel very happy that the society has matured and parents have opened up to their girls studying more and becoming working professionals and becoming bread winners for themselves.
- I think the interaction I had with Salman in 'London Dreams' kind of helped to have a comfortable relationship in 'Ready' because of the rapport created. He is always very supportive.
- I don't consider myself so big that I can't work with any other actress. I'm very easy-going.
- I will definitely be doing films down south if anything good comes along.
- I don't have to do films to pay my bills, nor am I insecure to think that out of sight is out of mind.
- Each film has its own fate, and you can't go through personal emotions based on the highs and lows of a film.
