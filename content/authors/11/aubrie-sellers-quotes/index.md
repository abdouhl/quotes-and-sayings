- Steve Earle had a mainstream career. Dwight Yoakam had a mainstream career. Willie Nelson did. But they always made good music, they always stuck to who they were. They weren't relying on radio like a lot of people are in Nashville.
- When I was thinking of video ideas for this song, I wanted it to reflect the energy of the music and express the big eye roll that 'Sit Here and Cry' is. I had a very specific visual vision for it, and when I saw Sam Siske's reel, I knew he was going to get it.
- When I'm writing, I'm focusing more on just the basic melody and the lyrics.
- A lot of the songs are very rock-oriented. My voice makes them country, and a lot of people think that is a strange combination... I think it creates something different and unique.
- My record's all electric, and that's why I call it 'garage country.'
- I always knew I was going to do something with music, but with my whole family being in the business, acting was something that was just mine. But when I was 20 or 21, I started writing songs and felt the itch to make a record.
- My favorite movies are from directors that have a vision, like Wes Anderson or Tim Burton.
- I've always been drawn to the real stuff and the stuff that feels authentic. And so when I'm writing songs, that's what I try to do.
- When I first started performing, I was a nervous wreck. Honestly, sometimes I felt like I was going to run off the stage.
- 'Elle' is such an iconic magazine, and the intersection of fashion and music has always been something that fascinates me.
- It is like therapy to write and have people connect with it. That's the kind of music I connect with most.
- Everyone in my family, they do music, and they love music; it's all about the music.
- I think that because I have so many different influences, and that shows in my music, that different people can connect with it.
- I was born in Nashville, but my whole family is from East Texas, so I consider myself a dual citizen.
- I didn't sign a record deal; I didn't do any of that. I made my record independently, and I went out and hit the road in a van.
- The drums are very trashy: it's all electric, it's very in your face, and it's not perfect. It's raw, and I think that's what 'garage' means.
- 'Sit Here and Cry' was one of the first songs I wrote with that overdramatic sarcastic dry sense of humor, which is why the energy of the song doesn't necessarily reflect the subject matter.
- So much of the music I love is polarizing. People might either hate it or love it, but they remember it because it was different. That means it was pushing buttons and not just following trends.
- I prefer to create friction. Because if you're not pushing buttons, you're just making something pleasant; it's probably been done before, and it's not making anyone feel anything.
- That's why I made my record before I had a label. I put it out independently - in a way, out of fear - because I didn't want anyone to change it.
- I love narrative videos, but sometimes I think they can limit a listener's experience of a song.
- I think my music is a little shocking to some people because my voice is very traditional-sounding, and my music is not.
- It's very important to me that every person takes away their own meaning from a song, and it's why I don't always love spelling out what a song is about for somebody.
- My voice is very country, and my songwriting is very country.
- Listening to 'Raising Sand' was one of those turning points in my life that really made something click in my brain.

- At this very early stage in my career, I want people to experience the music first and let it drive their imagination and their experiences.
- I had all these raw, gritty rock records that really inspired me sonically, and so I think everything I listen to when I started writing my own songs kind of came out naturally, and it created this new sound.
- I think what I've learned to focus on is my music, and that's why I made my record independently.
- Playing at the Opry, for me, it has such a history. It feels sort of like a coming-out party as a country artist. To know your heroes have played here is kind of crazy.
- I was always drawn to darker sounds, things with an edge and a little bit of grit, things that have a lot of emotion and a lot of drive.
- I grew up in the entertainment industry, and I think being around that gave me a different perspective on people and what's real and what's fake. I think about that a lot, and it comes out in my songs.
- I don't tend to write when I'm happy, which I think is pretty obvious.
- I tend to write from a personal place, and most of the time when I'm writing by myself, it's coming from something I've experienced.
- I want a long-lasting career. I want to build up a fan base that will come to my shows and love me no matter if I have a song on the radio or not.

- I just don't have a tolerance for people being fake, I don't think. Maybe especially when I think they have bad intentions.
- Sometimes I'll meet somebody, and they've looked me up online or whatever, and they've never heard me talk or met me. I think they expect me to be a lot darker than I am and maybe less - not less friendly - but I guess I'm drawn to that dark emotional music. Maybe they think I'm a little more brooding.
- Vocally, I sound like my mom. I don't think I can help it. That's just my natural voice.
- There's a new grievance every day to write about.
- To be honest, when you grow up in the music business, people heard me sing from a young age, and you get offered development deals and things like that.
