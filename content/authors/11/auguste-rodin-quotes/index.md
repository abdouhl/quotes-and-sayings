Every flower has a cordial word which nature directs towards him.''' ,'''Art is contemplation. It is the pleasure of the mind which searches into nature and which there divines the spirit of which nature herself is animated.''' ,'''To the artist there is never anything ugly in nature.''' ,'''There are unknown forces in nature; when we give ourselves wholly to her, without reserve, she lends them to us; she shows us these forms, which our watching eyes do not see, which our intelligence does not understand or suspect.''' ,'''Man's naked form belongs to no particular moment in history; it is eternal, and can be looked upon with joy by the people of all ages.''' ,'''I invent nothing, I rediscover.''' ,]
