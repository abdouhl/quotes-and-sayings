quotes = ['''Many are ambitious of saying grand things, that is, of being grandiloquent.''' ,'''It is a proof of our natural bias to evil, that gain is slower and harder than loss in all things good; but in all things bad getting is quicker and easier than getting rid of.''' ,'''Nothing is farther than earth from heaven; nothing is nearer than heaven to earth.''' ,'''Crimes sometimes shock us too much; vices almost always too little.''' ,'''It is with flowers as with moral qualities; the bright are sometimes poisonous; but, I believe, never the sweet.''' ,'''What a person praises is perhaps a surer standard, even than what he condemns, of his own character, information and abilities.''' ,'''Thought is the wind, knowledge the sail, and mankind the vessel.''' ,'''As to the pure all things are pure, even so to the impure all things are impure.''' ,'''There is no being eloquent for atheism. In that exhausted receiver the mind cannot use its wings, - the clearest proof that it is out of its element.''' ,'''Examples would indeed be excellent things were not people so modest that none will set, and so vain that none will follow them.''' ,'''Love, it has been said, flows downward.

Could we understand half what mothers say and do to their infants, we should be filled with a conceit of our own importance, which would render us insupportable through life.''' ,'''A mother should give her children a superabundance of enthusiasm; that after they have lost all they are sure to lose on mixing with the world, enough may still remain to prompt fated support them through great actions.''' ,'''Since the generality of persons act from impulse, much more than from principle, men are neither so good nor so bad as we are apt to think them.''' ,'''The intellect of the wise is like glass; it admits the light of heaven and reflects it.''' ,'''The virtue of paganism was strength; the virtue of Christianity is obedience.''' ,'''The power of faith will often shine forth the most when the character is naturally weak.''' ,'''Only when the voice of duty is silent, or when it has already spoken, may we allowably think of the consequences of a particular action.''' ,'''Happy the boy whose mother is tired of talking nonsense to him before he is old enough to know the sense of it.''' ,'''A man prone to suspect evil is mostly looking in his neighbor for what he sees in himself.''' ,'''To Adam Paradise was home. To the good among his descendants home is paradise.''' ,'''Some people carry their hearts in their heads; very many carry their heads in their hearts. The difficulty is to keep them apart, yet both actively working together.''' ,'''What hypocrites we seem to be whenever we talk of ourselves! Our words sound so humble, while our hearts are so proud.''' ,'''A statesman, we are told, should follow public opinion. Doubtless, as a coachman follows his horses; having firm hold on the reins and guiding them.''' ,'''Nothing good bursts forth all at once. The lightning may dart out of a black cloud; but the day sends his bright heralds before him, to prepare the world for his coming.''' ,]
