- Ninety-nine percent of the things that seem weird in my life can be answered with my religion. Paganism is mostly about nature-worship. It's about being in harmony with your environment and bringing the world of spirit and world of man together. It's about balance.
- I'm not a paranoid schizophrenic.
- My accent really comes out when I'm speaking in public or when I'm passionate about something.
- To circumscribe our freedom of thought because of the delicate sensibilities of suburban paper pushers is the most despicable type of totalitarian tyranny imaginable.
- I did sacrifice a goat. I know that's probably a quibble in the mind of most Americans.
- I have prophesied for years that I was born for a Great War; that if I did not witness the coming of the Second American Civil War, I would begin it myself.
- I totally understand I'm an eccentric person; I'm not going to claim to be a normal person.
- It has been said that I am not a 'real' Libertarian. A certain faction of the Party has come to believe that the writings of Ayn Rand and Milton Friedman are the holy texts of Libertarianism, and I disagree. I believe that the Libertarian movement is and should be more encompassing than the narrow-minded advocacy of economic anarchy.

- I don't think I'm the only person who sees a cataclysm coming, but I think I'm the only person saying it, and I think that scares people.
- I think it's disingenuous for people to talk in their living rooms about government collapsing, the possibility of total anarchy, but when someone says it in public, it's so terrifying they have to persecute that person.
