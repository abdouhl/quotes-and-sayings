- It's great when people recognise you as 'Karan Wahi' and not a character you have played.

- Usually, the interest in the personal lives of celebrities is mainly for gossip.
- Since I come from a television background, that has been my school of thought from the beginning, but what TV does to you is it drains you out because you are just working every day.
- I think Lara Dutta is a super talented beauty-with-brains kind of an actress.
- I try to remain under radar as much as I can. In our line of work, whatever we do makes news, and with social media, people comment on everything. When it comes to love, the day I get married, I will tell the world about my wife.
- I am really fond of accessorizing my car. If the world outside isn't too good looking, at least the car should be nice and comfortable from within.
- We live in a social media world where there are people who have perhaps done nothing big but are earning more than us, who are these people following them, making them stars? It is the audience.

- I have been doing a lot of web shows but with so many platforms around, you can't binge on all my work.
- I started driving when I was really young, at the age of 15-16. It just came naturally to me because I learnt it on my own by observing others. Of course, I was never allowed to drive until I was 18, but I would park my parents' car at every given opportunity.
- Why will I leave TV? For me, work is priority. The medium might change, but I, as an actor, don't.
- I'm an actor first then an anchor. Had I not been a popular actor, I'd have probably not got the opportunity to host a show. I enjoy the latter because it's me there and I rediscover a lot of things personally.
- The basic idea of making this film was that even if one person is touched by the thought in the film, then my job as a storyteller is done.

- I don't interact with people much. So some people find me arrogant but some find me very sweet.
- I am not saying I have a problem with it, I am very proud to start from TV, it has made me what I am today. But, to segregate people based on the platform they work on, and then talk about equal opportunities? We shouldn't be.
- I don't tell myself what to do and what not to. If I like a show, I do it.

- Most 25 year old guys have to work hard to impress the girls and have to do all the chasing. For me the roles are reversed. What more can a guy ask for? It's fun to be the centre of attention.
- A lot of actors overthink about the kind of roles they wanna do. I am open to kind of any kind of role.
- I love being famous.
- I have been blessed to have managed to make many good friends in the industry over the years. There are a few who are your best friends and you do have soul-friends too.

- Yes, cricket is still the number one choice for youngsters, but today, a child wouldn't hesitate to tell his parents that they want to be a boxer or anything.

- I know that being an actor, I'm a public figure and anything that I do will become news.
- Just because I am not seen on TV, people feel I am MIA.
- Viewers don't see more of anchors because we shoot only once a week and it's aired across three months; so, you always feel that a certain person is only anchoring. I've been acting for fifteen years and hosting for seven years, but I haven't done a soap, so a lot of people tend to think I'm not acting anymore.
- Before 'Hundred', my best work was 'Barcode', but if you didn't watch it, you will never know it.
- I am an actor, I get really happy when people find me good looking but I am the happiest when people comment on the work I did.
- I feel every project that I have done in my life, which is acting oriented, has been something that I believed in.
- In hindsight, most of us are also limited with our resources, one has to think about themselves too. So I put it out there that I'm open to collaborations on social media, for brands too, if they deposit money directly into the account of an NGO, I send them.
- Why call me inferior to another person just because of the platform we come from. I think the audience need to reflect on that aspect. If I work on TV, and on web as well, and even in films then why just call me a TV actor?
- What 'Hundred' has done for me, it has open up avenues where people find more things about me, other than my body or the way I look because coming from TV background, there is anyway a little less perspective given to the kind of talent we possess.
- Before a celeb or a star, I am an actor.
- Acting is acting, whether you do it on TV, film, web, theatre or ads. It depends on the person, time and situation, what the individual wants to choose.
- Though I love driving, I am not much of a long drive person. In Mumbai, we hardly have roads for long drives and the highways are mostly clogged up with traffic.
- I will say 'I love you' in the same way on any medium. We have this hierarchy in our heads between TV and films, and I know that for a fact because I have experienced it first-hand.

- I love driving and I love my car, so letting someone else drive my car is impossible. I drive myself everywhere.
- I love acting. Anchoring and dancing have come to me because of acting. I came here to be an actor. All others are just an extension of it.
- If you think you are young, then that is what you will be. I also feel that with age, comes maturity. But if you think that you are old, then that is what you will be.
- I believe that it is my responsibility to keep my personal life normal by not talking about it.
- It's not a big deal to send a film to the festivals, but yes, winning an award is huge. When you send a film at festivals, people talk about you and your work, and one gets great exposure.
- I don't believe in the word 'influencer', I don't believe I'll inspire people, because what might be right for me might not be from another perspective.
- Different mediums are giving a different kind of satisfaction. The reason I do television, if I do web for the same reason, I will not be able to sustain it, and vice versa.
- Sometimes, you have to reject a few, because of the maker, because of the money. But I try to play every role honestly, be it big or small, hero or villain.
