- People are realizing that podcasting is special.
- Yeah, I mean, I did regular stand-up for a long time. And I did - I stopped doing stand-up when I worked on 'Ellen,' which was for five years. So when I went back to it, I found that, like, regular stand-up didn't really do it for me anymore. It almost felt insincere, like I wasn't saying anything I actually really wanted to say.
- I think women believed for a long time that it was inappropriate for them to be interested in true crime. It made them judge themselves, or feel weird or ghoulish.
- We all feel anxious at times and acknowledging that only helps.
- I'm just a deeply jealous person. And I want blame everybody else for what I don't have.
- I think people are isolated and really lonely.
- Many of us were raised with the 'be a lady' thing, and all those kind of things that can be used against you and strip you out of opportunity and power.
- Sitcoms are bad in so many ways it's hard to say why. They can hype things as much as they want, but it's all crap, no matter how many TV Guide cover stories there are.
- When I was a kid we'd go and visit my grandmother, and my dad is one of eight so they'd all be sitting there updating everyone on the good things but also on the fact that so and so had cancer or had lost their job, and people would make jokes.
- It's very exciting to have a hit anything and it's also horrifying and a really high-pressure feeling sometimes. I feel like there's no end to the excitement and the freshness, because there's stuff happening every day. I think it's more like, within that whirlwind, how do you actually stay sane and keep your feet on the ground?
- I want to talk about the things that people don't think you're allowed to talk about.
- I think sometimes it's only by talking about what's really going on that you can make it less scary.
- I don't know the States.
- Writing about our mistakes turns the stupid stuff we've done and cringed over for years into a sort of do's-and-don'ts guide for others. Actually, more of a don'ts-and-don't guide.
- Any therapist can give you the expertise of their education, but we all know there's that person in our lives that's been like, 'Hey, one time I did this thing,' and that will stay with you for so much longer than the stuff that probably should, because it's from direct experience.
- Santa Barbara's gorgeous. It's just a perfect little getaway.
- I think there are lots of those moments when we meet people - listeners at a meet-and-greet - and they tell us that they've changed their major to forensic science, or criminal justice, or they've become a victim's advocate.
- We get some great gifts. Trophies, very funny things, one woman even made a diorama of us sitting recording the podcast.
- Two kids riding their bikes to an empty lot? It never ends well.
- I do love Turner Classic Movies, because I feel like I'm not wasting as much time. I'm almost educating myself if I watch that.
- There's nothing better than a personal story.
- True crime has always been popular.
- I turned down a job when I was broke to the point that I was about to go into foreclosure on my house, but I didn't want to work on the job because of the content of the show.
- Every true-crime thing you see goes in with that kind of ominous music and low lighting, so to be able to talk about these things but not have to feel somber about it and not feel guilty that you're not feeling somber about it - I think that's what appeals to me.
- I think most people's conversations are as light as they are dark. That's how life is.
- I had to host a comedy show the day after 9/11, and I really knocked it out of the park. But that was before the Internet really took off, so the only people that know are the people who were there.
- True crime is not for everybody.
- Life is as horrifyingly frightening as it is hilarious.
- I've done stand-up at airport Holiday Inns and that's where you feel like you're doing comedy for people that hate it.
- It's true, there are so many talented people who listen to our podcast. There are incredible crafters and artists.
- We're in no way crime journalists or professionals really.
- I've done bit parts on shows where I've been the fat girl or the punk rocker.
- I told my mom for years that I wanted to be a manicurist, and she'd always be like, 'But what if you went to college and you got a degree?' She'd try to explain how I could actually do a thing that would make me a ton of money, or that I didn't have to just pick the business that was closest to our house.
