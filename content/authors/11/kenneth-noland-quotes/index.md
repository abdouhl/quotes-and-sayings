- For me context is the key - from that comes the understanding of everything.
- Pollock was well known, certainly, but for all the wrong reasons. He was known as much for being wild and unconventional in his working methods as for being a great artist.
- The scene then as now was centered in New York. For the most part, I've kept a bit apart from that attractive and seductive city. I've done it by living in the country within commuting distance.
- I've also been willing to share any help that I could give to any other artist.
- In the '50s Morris Louis and I were not known, David Smith and Helen Frankenthaler were not much known.
- Because of this the representation I'm interested in is of those things only the eye can touch.
- Clem had made it known that Pollock was a great painter.
- With artists of my own generation there was at first no group identity - and never a clique.
- I met David Smith through my former wife, Cornelia, who'd studied with him.
- Usually I throw away what I don't get right the first time.
- I think of painting without subject matter as music without words.
- Context begins with other artists - seniors and mentors.
- As time goes on, I realize more and more that, beginning in the early 30's, David Smith began setting the precedent for what was to come later for many of us.
