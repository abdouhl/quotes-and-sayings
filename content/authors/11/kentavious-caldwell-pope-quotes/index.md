- I can only focus on what I can control.
- I'm very confident, in anything that I do.
- When I was in the second unit, it just took me time to find my rhythm just playing with a lot of new guys. But once I got in the starting lineup, it kind of just opened up a little bit.
- I see myself as what I'm worth.
- That's part of my game: just running the wing, defending.
- Really when I'm on the court, it's about me playing.
- If you've got a big man who scores the ball, you've got to defend, and if you've got a shooter, you've got to pick and choose who you're going to defend.

- I just got to be ready to knock down shots.
- I've been working hard to get playing time, just for whatever. I'm up for whatever I can earn.
- Showing teams I can do more than just shoot the ball, that's really going to help me out.
- Going to the rim, you either get fouled or get an easy two.
- I can't let my frustration get the best of me.

- I just wanted my dad to be a part of my life, wanted him to continue to be there.
- If you're open in certain spots, you just shoot the ball. It doesn't matter if you're good from that spot or not.
- When I get up, I usually have a missed call from either my sons or my wife. Every day we try to talk on FaceTime, try to talk after practice and stuff like that throughout the day. Try to stay in contact as much as possible.
- Most teams won't really focus on one player because they've got multiple players to defend and that will open up a lot of things for me.
- Like each and every year I got to think that way, anyway. I got to think about the next person trying to come in and take my job, so I got to continue to... work hard and prove myself.
- I don't mind staying home. I'm a homebody anyway, so I don't mind.
- No one gets beat by 61 and then come out and plays flat the next game.
- When I defend, it keeps me patient and lets my game come to me on the offensive end.
- He's a great shot-blocker. So once you go in there, you've got to either get into his body and get an and-one, or you've got to drive and kick. It's not all about trying to force the shot over a shot-blocker like Nerlens Noel. You've got to kick it.
- I like challenges.
- Nine times out of 10 I'd like to bet on myself.
- I like scary movies. I like the mystery that leaves you wanting to watch the next one.

- There's always room to improve, so I'm going to continue to improve on defense, offense, being consistent and continuing to play hard.

- My teammates are incredible. Just to be a part of this organization and this group, it's amazing with all the history behind the Lakers; I'm just glad to be a part of it.
- I can bring a lot. I play both sides of the ball. I defend. I have an offensive game. I rebound the ball. I get steals a lot.
- To know through my struggles, 'My coach still believes in me,' does a lot for your mindset.
- To play the game at this level, I've got to continue to get better. I've got to stay consistent, still work on my ballhandling and I've got to become a great defender.

- My teammates are part of my family as well.
- I'm a shooter and shooters shoot.
- You can learn a lot. You can learn how to win. You can learn how to be coached.
- Ballhandling - I made it a focus in all my workouts - working on my handles coming off screens with it, one or two-dribble pull-ups, making second moves, trying to mix it up and continuing to get better each day.
- The first year I kind of struggled to find where my shots was coming from, when to cut, where to be.
