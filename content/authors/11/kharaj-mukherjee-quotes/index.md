- I've dubbed for as many number of films as Uttam Kumar has acted in. However, dubbing artistes are never given a recognition and are expected to be conditioned to that too.
- In Partho's comedy, 'Ami Montri Holam,' I am a minister. This is basically a play and a great actor like Jahor Roy had essayed this role years back. I hope I can deliver five per cent of what he did.
- We all have been given equal screen space in 'Hoichoi Unlimited.' We had great fun in Uzbekistan.
- Even before marriage I used cook delicious dishes for my wife and mother-in-law on Jamai Sasthi.
- I've dubbed for the likes of Rabi Ghose, Anup Kumar, Anil Chatterjee, Asrani, Ranjit Mallick, among others.
- In Raja Chanda's 'Ley Halua Ley,' I essay Locket's miser husband, who is suspicious of his beautiful wife. He is ready to go to any extent to protect his wife. The script of this film is hilarious.
- In Surojit's film, 'Pagol Hawar Bodol Din,' I am a villager. Victor Banerjee is also part of the film. The uniqueness of 'PHBD' is that the whole film is like a poem.
- My life is eventful.
- Why women will do all the household works? It should change.
- I have celebrated Jamai Sasthi before marriage.
