- I tried to swim as much as possible. Being in Southern California in the summer time, it's so nice because you have the warm beaches, so I try to swim every day.
- I'm trying to get a lower center of gravity. I think, when I play at a lower level, it helps my overall game, just my explosiveness to the rim with the ball in my hands. When I play with a lower center of gravity, my legs are always in my shot instead of playing vertical out there where I don't get the same explosion or legs into my shot.
- I don't try to attach myself to technology so much. I'm on my phone a lot, though, but in the off season, I try to get away from it as much as I can.
- I knew my worth. I knew I could be one of the best 2-guards in the league. I'm not going to be bashful about it anymore.
- The cool thing about Snapchat is you can get a lot of news on there now. There's CNN, ESPN, and I find myself reading the most random articles. I don't know how it actually benefits me, but it's interesting. I like to stay up on current events, so I have to give kudos to Snapchat: they've done a good job of that. But I'm on there way too much.
- I never tried Pokemon Go. I figured I'd get too addicted to it. I did play Pokemon Snap on Nintendo 64, so that window is closed for me.
- Not missing games, miss one game due to injury in my career, and that even hurt me to miss that game, but I just love to get out there and compete, both ends of the ball, and I don't think I'm afraid to take the big shot. If I'm 2-for-15, I'm not afraid to take that shot, make it 3-for-16.
- I think I might not be the best vertical athlete, but I think I'm quicker than people give me credit for. That was the biggest knock on me coming out of college.
- I know to win a championship, you're not going to do it alone. You're going to have to have a great supporting cast.
- When you're overseas and on a trip for awhile, it's tough to stay groomed. You miss your routine.
