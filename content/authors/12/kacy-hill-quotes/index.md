quotes = [''''Bloo' is a compilation of a few songs I've written over the past year, inspired by the necessity of finding happiness in the people I choose to surround myself with.''' ,'''I went to this little performing arts school in downtown Phoenix. You had to dance or act, and everyone sang in choir. I started out playing the saxophone, but I always wanted to be in an orchestra. That was a dream as a kid, and there aren't a lot of saxophones in an orchestra.''' ,'''I grew up in Arizona, but I moved to L.A. when I was 18 to model. I was doing work for American Apparel and then got cast in the Yeezus tour. Vanessa Beecroft did the creative direction, and they hired three American Apparel models and nine dancers - it wasn't a lot of dancing; we were mostly just walking.''' ,'''I was on Kanye's Yeezus tour as a dancer, but really, I was a Vanessa Beecroft model. I was one of the three 'dancers' who couldn't dance and was more of an accessory than an individual. Vanessa was pretty involved. Her style is about a lot of standing. It's very simple but haunting.''' ,'''I myself was a wedding photographer when I was, like, 16.''' ,'''I have these long nails, but I literally do nothing to them! The thought of filing my nails drives me insane.''' ,'''I take these vitamins that make my hair grow like crazy. They're called Herpanacine, and I get them on Amazon - they've got echinacea and vitamins A and E. They're really good for your immune system, too. You don't get sick, and they really help your skin, hair, and nails.''' ,'''I have to remind myself constantly that people actually want to hear the music I've made; that's hard for me to digest. I think a live audience is the only tangible evidence you can have that your work is making an impact. It's really humbling.''' ,'''I have really sensitive skin, so all I use is Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser and Moisturizing Cream, and then during the day, I'll use CeraVe with SPF, but nothing crazy. My skin also gets really dry, so I do a mask from time to time - or if my skin is feeling dull, then I'll put one on.''' ,]
