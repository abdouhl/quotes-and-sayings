- I play guitar and sing when I'm not busy with school and acting.
- I think that the main thing that you can learn from watching 'The Spectacular Now' is just learning about growing up and moving on.
- I would have to say that I have to concentrate more when I'm doing comedy. There are so many details that make up any character, but developing a character for a dramatic role seems to come more naturally.
- It's really important that people know about it and the issue in schools because it happens every day to people and it really hurts when people get bullied.
- 'Last Man Standing' is overall a lot of comedy. And I love doing that.
- I love going back and forth from drama to comedy. I love switching it around and showing people that I can do both.
- When someone is bullying you, don't let it get to you. I remember my friends in school, someone said something mean to them, and they really let it get to them. And it really affected them. But I would just say try to ignore it as much as possible and just be yourself.
