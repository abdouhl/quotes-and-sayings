I went to Huddersfield and thought it was a good chance but I got there and felt like I didn't really fancy it.''' ,'''When I was younger, I was always that person that loved to get stuck in. When my mum and grandma used to come and watch me, I used to make sure that I wouldn't let anybody push me around and not let anybody bully me.''' ,'''Aston Villa had been in touch and they'd gone into the Premier League so I knew I could play in the Premier League just like that.''' ,'''I just feel like when I come up against another team, I'll always look at their best players and I'll think, if I can stop these doing what they are doing, then I'll get noticed and I'll help the team as well.''' ,'''The manager is always on at us about mental strength anyway. He just comes in and stresses how important it is to be strong mentally, to succeed you've got to go through pain both mentally and physically.''' ,'''Billy Bremner... was the captain of a very successful side.

I got scouted by a guy called Sonny Sweeney and went to Leeds City Boys.''' ,'''I've been using the phrase Black Lives Matter quite a lot. I'm not saying that all lives don't matter, I'm just saying that right now black people need support and they need help because of the racism going on all around the world.''' ,'''I didn't have much but my mum and grandma gave me as much as they could, but we weren't a rich family and we had to work hard for what we got.''' ,'''I wasn't a defender and I didn't think of myself as one.''' ,]
