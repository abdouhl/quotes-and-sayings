- My family did not believe I could act when I started off.
- Most definitely a daddy's girl... but I am close to both my parents. Amma is my biggest fan; Achan is my biggest critic, so it is difficult to please my father. I am always trying to make him proud.
- For some reason, I shied away from watching Telugu films but now I am hooked to them.
- If I failed in acting, I wanted to have a backup, thus I chose architecture. I learnt painting as well.
- I never thought I would debut in a Telugu film; it was my destiny to take up a film that, incidentally, was about destiny.
- The best thing my parents did was to make me study in Chennai. I was in a school where most others around me were also from film industry families so none of us realised what our parents were.
- I am a shy person who is not very okay with the camera.
- As a child I was on the sets all the time, even during vacation. Had I known I would be an actor, I'd have groomed and trained myself better.
- I never thought I had it in me to be an actor. There is so much more to the job than acting. But my parents gave me confidence.
- I feel that I would perform really well if there was no camera in front of me. But when there is one, and the director says 'Action!' I freeze.
- I have these memories of watching my dad thoroughly enjoying his work and I would have so much fun on the sets.
- Within my heart, I always wanted to begin with a Malayalam movie.
- So, when directors come up to me and ask if they should just narrate my role, I would say no and insist on knowing the whole story. It would give me a better idea of what I'm going to be a part of because when I look back at my career later on in life, nobody is going to remember my screen time.
- My dad felt I should give education priority since it will help me think better and differently from others.
- I look for diversity in roles.
- I'd rather have two minutes of screen time and have purpose than have 20 minutes of screen time in a separate track that makes no sense to the story.
- I would be glad to share the screen with anyone as long as I love my character and the story.
- I am a Malayali who was brought up in Chennai. I know both Malayalam and Tamil.
- But I applaud my parents for they never really put us in hell. Whatever, emotionally, they were going through... they made sure they never took that out at home.
- I have watched the movies of the 1980s on TV. At times, I feel that I should have lived in that era.
- Acting comes naturally to me as I have seeing and learning from my parents right from my childhood.
- Being a heroine in Vikram Kumar sir's film is everybody's wish.
- Hyderabad is such a lovely place.
- I like gangster movies, personally.
- I am happy to have been directed by my father, Priyadarshan, in the Malayalam movie 'Marakkar.' My dad said nothing about my performance during the shoot. But once done, he complimented me as a filmmaker, saying that I gave the output he needed.
- My mom was the happiest person when I first got a Telugu offer. She told me that the people here love cinema and will also love you. I have to agree with her.
- I've always had a thing for films about food.
- I thought behind the camera roles would suit me better because I'm sensitive.
- I'm a person who takes criticism personally and that had put doubts in my mind about doing a film. I tried to overcome it and give acting a shot.
- I got a degree in architecture for the educational experience but in terms of career, everything is cinema.
- That is one advice my dad gave me... to not look at the screen time but to look at being a part of good films.
- While doing my architecture from the Parsons School of Design, I also did theatre.
- I grew up watching film shootings as I always accompanied my father during my holidays. So I was not scared about facing the camera nor did I go to any acting classes.
- Some stories are meant to be experienced by everyone and language and culture are no bar.
- I've always loved telling stories.
