What can change in historically different circumstances is only the form in which these laws expose themselves.''' ,'''Let the ruling classes tremble at a communist revolution. The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win. Workingmen of all countries, unite!''' ,'''Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people.''' ,'''Necessity is blind until it becomes conscious.
