quotes = ['''Without Socialism the working class is a heterogeneous mixture of different categories, some of which have independent, varying interests, sometimes opposed to each other.''' ,'''Every social organisation which is rooted in life still lasts a long time, even after the conditions from which it drew its strength have changed in a manner unfavourable to it.''' ,'''The Social-Democratic Federation took part in all the political and economic struggles of the English working class; it took pains to bring Socialist views home to them, not only through agitation and propaganda, but also by actions.''' ,'''Life provides material for its agitation which makes its general views comprehensible to the masses.''' ,'''If a Labour movement, on a bourgeois basis, has hitherto existed in the country where the new movement is awakening it will certainly not disappear all at once.''' ,'''The mass of workers, as yet non-Socialist, is retarded in its development towards Socialism.''' ,'''The enmity of such a party towards Socialism does not mean that the members are only prejudiced against it because they do not know it; it means that they are possessed of bourgeois ideas, and wish to determine their policy accordingly.''' ,'''Thus in such a Labour Party there can be no question of independent policy.''' ,'''In general, if signs of sectarianism do appear in a Socialist Party, these are only the products of the absence of a broad Labour movement in the country.''' ,'''A Labour party is not a debating club, it is a party of action.''' ,]
