- Many people have made sacrifices to continue their education, or to allow their children to continue theirs. Others have made sacrifices by taking a path that didn't include continuing, because they could not afford to do so. None of these are things that could ever be replaced with cash.
- The bottom line is: If any government has a rule that would legally allow it to punish people for things that don't deserve punishment, then that law should be scrapped or changed.
- Now, to anyone with even half a brain, a newspaper apologizing because a reporter did some reporting makes about as much sense as a doctor apologizing because he gave someone a diagnosis.
- Yes, dodgeball encourages competitiveness. Yes, the stronger, more athletic kids are going to be more successful at it than the weaker ones, but what game doesn't have winners and losers?
- The bottom line is: It is fine to have issues with President Trump; I've had them myself. The thing is, though, the best way to argue against the things that you disagree with is never to use abusive tactics.
- There are some professions, of course, where licensing is important. For example: If there's someone out there claiming to be a top heart surgeon whose only qualifications are having played Operation as a child, then I'm going to have a problem with that. I'm definitely going to say that jail time is appropriate in this instance.
- Far too many people believe that they are owed some kind of 'safe space' from opposing ideas, and the fact is, that just isn't true - and we shouldn't allow people to say that it is true without correcting them.
- My favorite tweets are the, 'I used to like and then you said this,' 'I used to like you then you suggested that president Trump was not the savior of all of us.' It's absolutely ridiculous.
- The United States of America is supposed to be a free country, and its law enforcement is supposed to exist to protect and serve its citizens.
- In fact, I can confidently say that 'South Park's' penchant for unbridled derision has been directly responsible for my own joy in some times of terrible sadness.
- Is burning an American flag a disgusting, reprehensible act? Yes, it absolutely is, and I would tell that to the face of absolutely anyone who has done so.
- As a woman, I have faced issues that men do not have to face - sexism included. I think that all women have, and that is totally unacceptable.
- Let's all be honest here for a second, okay - bacon? Not even that good. Now, I'm not saying that it's bad. I like bacon-wrapped dates, and I've also been known to enjoy a BLT a couple of times a year. What I'm saying is, bacon is fine, but it is objectively not so good that we need bacon-scented sunscreen.
- A person in power should never use his position to intimidate citizens from exercising their rights.
- To be an Instagram model, you absolutely cannot just post pictures of yourself in a bikini for the sake of people seeing you in a bikini - even if that is exactly what you are doing. No, you need to caption these photos with an inspirational quote so that people will know that you are not just a butt, you're a gosh dang philosopher.
- See, one of the greatest things about living in the United States is that we have the absolute freedom to say whatever we want about our government, while being protected against government retaliation.
- The greatest risk in giving our government any power to control our speech is that it would then have a vehicle to prohibit speech that was critical of it.
- See, locking people up who present no real danger to society isn't just unfair to those people and those who love them. It is, but it's also unfair to the people who pay to keep them there: the taxpayers. Let me be clear: Locking someone up is not free.
- Politics has become absurdly, stupidly, restrictively partisan.

- People actually have the nerve to ask me if I want to go to a haunted house. Why would I want to go to a place where I have to pay my money for creepy strangers to be able to harass me without legal repercussions?
- See, believe it or not, I actually support complete free speech not because I don't care about the welfare of the American people. I support it because I do.
- Nutrition advice is, quite frankly, subjective.
- Let me be clear: It's not that I'm not a patriot because I want to keep flag-burning legal, it's that I want to keep flag-burning legal because I am a patriot.
- Straight-news pieces are supposed to be just that: straight news. They are not supposed to be biased, and a longtime practice for ensuring this is to ask all subjects of a story for their comment.
- All too often, I will see people on the left slam Trump for the way he treats or talks about other people. Then those same individuals - sometimes even in the same breath - will go on to say even worse things about the people who voted for him.
- I myself have been the victim of some absolutely horrific speech throughout the years; I know how bad it can make you feel - and yet, I still believe firmly that no words directed at me could ever feel worse than having to worry about losing my right to use my own.
- As a general rule, I don't like to see laws that allow for the arrest and incarceration of people based on a sort of subjective standard.
- I can't be alone in saying that humor has gotten me through some hard times in my life.
- There are cruel, terrible things that happen in this world that are even more traumatizing than the existence of Jeff Sessions. Yes, it can be painful to read about them - but we can never hope to change what we cannot first recognize.
- It's true: Whenever I see a government rule that could clearly be used to punish people for doing innocuous things, it is never enough for some government official to just assure me that it won't be used that way. Those assurances, after all, aren't binding; they're lip service.
- I have lexical-gustatory synesthesia. I can taste, and always have tasted, words. I remember when I was a kid and learning to read I mentioned to my mom that certain words I was learning tasted certain ways, thinking everyone was like that, and didn't understand why she didn't get what I was saying.
- I've lived a passionate life.
- Football is, honestly, so objectively bad that I have always been convinced that the only reason it is so 'popular' is some kind of mass conspiracy. Everyone who 'likes' it is just pretending to like it because they see other people 'liking' it, and now we are all forced to endure it.
- There's people on the left who refuse to consider that anybody but the government can solve any of their problems.
- Although I certainly do love animals, I have to admit that I also love eating them. (Particularly cows. And chickens. And the occasional lamb).
- Most of my columns at National Review focus on PC culture, and sometimes, when I write about some idiotic, anti-free-speech idea presented by some idiotic, anti-free-speech student or professor, people will ask me why I wasted my time writing about it.
- Hillary Clinton had the backing of the entire DNC during her 2016 run, and yet, after she lost, all she could do was whine incessantly about how many people had wronged her throughout the process and made it so unfair.
- College is supposed to be a place that prepares its students for the real world. That's the entire purpose of attending! Learning how to be an engaged citizen is something that should be encouraged in this kind of environment, not restricted.
- Make no mistake: Deciding to abstain from the Pledge of Allegiance does communicate something, and therefore, it is a form of speech. It's also a form of peaceful protest, the right to which is another one of our values.
- It's true: What one person might consider 'hate speech,' another might consider to be harmless, or even funny.
- As both a First Amendment absolutist and as an American, I want to keep our government as far away from our press as possible.
- Our freedom to criticize the government - as openly and brutally as we want to - serves as a vital check against unbridled government power and control.
- Personally, my general winter rule is that, if I'm not being paid to leave my apartment, then I'll be damned if I'm leaving.
- Kids only have a certain number of years to be kids, and the last thing we should be doing is incarcerating them for wanting to make that short-lived magic last.
- To me, it seems pretty obvious that socialism is terrible. After all, do you know what's not terrible? Freedom.
- Don't like flag-burning? Fine. Hate flag-burning? Me too! The thing is, though, hating something doesn't always mean that the answer is to call on government powers to ban it - and, in fact, I'd say that that is rarely the best solution, especially when it comes to speech.
- For some reason, our culture is one that preaches that furthering your education is something that is always worth the price tag, and the truth is, that simply isn't the case.
- Getting the police involved or levying an absurd punishment just because that's what some zero-tolerance rule mandates - even though it's clear that the student in question wasn't a danger - doesn't make anyone safer. Worse, it can actually cause harm.
- Beto O'Rourke may think he wants to be president, but I am here to help him recognize the truth: What he really wants to be is an Instagram model.
- I am, quite clearly, no fan of PETA or its way of thinking - but that doesn't mean that I want the group to be silenced. Instead, I have simply done what we all are supposed to have the right to do in this country: to use my own speech to counter what I disagreed with, rather than to move to silence it.
- Make no mistake... 'South Park' is brutal. It takes subjects that aren't supposed to be touched at all and handles them roughly. It's true that it's crude and rude and disgusting, even in its treatment of subjects that are supposed to be solemn - spoken of only in polite whispers and polished platitudes if they're ever spoken of at all.
- Like him or not, you really should respect the fact that Justin Amash makes his political decisions based only on his principles - which is truly refreshing in our hyper-partisan era.
- In fact, despite the fact that he's somehow managed to brand himself as a moderate choice, Michael Bloomberg's record is actually that of an authoritarian nightmare.
- All too often, we see politicians on both sides desperately twisting themselves into partisan-hack pretzels, for the sole purpose of defending their own 'team' or attacking the other, without any thought to principles or values whatsoever.
- I know that money is precious - but, at least to me, laughter and expression are even more so.
- Throughout his career, Bloomberg has repeatedly shown blatant disrespect for individual rights and civil liberties. The first thing that comes to mind is probably the way he tried to micromanage New Yorkers' food choices during his time as mayor.

- The flag is a symbol of our freedom, and burning it absolutely is one of the least patriotic things that a person could possibly do. I say 'one of the least' because I can think of a few things that would actually be less so - and, as a matter of fact, I think that banning flag-burning would absolutely be on that list.
- It's true: I can't think of even a single way in which society suffers because of a 15-year-old trick-or-treater.
- Perhaps the most common argument against the advocates of cancel culture is that they're lame and uncreative - and I think they generally are.
- The reality is, punishing people by using a sentencing enhancement that was clearly intended to punish people who had been doing something far worse is, by definition, a miscarriage of justice.
- See, as a libertarian, I am actually far more liberal on the issue of immigration than many people might expect.
- There is value in education, but, as we do with anything else, we should start being careful to weigh that value with the price tag that's attached to it.

The plan was to go to Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism to learn broadcasting after I graduated. I was enrolled and everything, but ultimately decided that I could never afford to pay back the loan I'd have to take out.
- President Donald Trump has now sued the New York Times, the Washington Post, and CNN over opinion pieces that they've published - and really, he should stop.
- The United States is, after all, supposed to be a free country - and it has never made any sense to me that choices about what to put into our own bodies aren't ours and ours alone.
- For years, fiscally conservative advocacy groups were giving then-Republican representative Justin Amash awards, praise, and donations. Now that he's an independent, however, many of those same groups are snubbing him entirely.
- Absolutely no one should be arguing for a system aimed at increasing ignorance.
- It's time to stop locking people up for victimless crimes.
- The truth is, sometimes the best way for the government to help those in need is to stop itself from 'helping' them at all.

- If I had my way, no one would ever be separated from his or her family over a personal choice that involved only his or her body.
- The truth of the matter is, 'uncomfortable' does not equal 'unsafe,' and 'disagreement' does not equal 'danger.'
- No one, and I mean no one, gets personally offended by someone saying a food that they like is just okay - as if I had just attacked one of their character traits - unless 'character trait' is exactly what they consider liking that food to be.
- I will never, ever support a law that could clearly lead to an abuse of power just because of some lip service assuring me that it won't be used that way. To me, that's not enough.
- People often give Biden a pass for inaccurate and misleading statements - writing them off as nothing more than Crazy Uncle Joe being Crazy Uncle Joe.
- I'm sorry, but there is absolutely no reason why bacon envelope glue should exist, let alone be so popular that it's sold out.
- The truth is, one of the best things about being 15 years old is that things like candy are still exciting. Once you get older, once you've been knocked down enough by this cruel thing we call life, that just won't be the case anymore. Eventually, you'll become jaded.
- One thing is clear: Our governments have too many laws.
- I myself have appeared on countless panels alongside people with whom I've disagreed, at times even vehemently - and yet, the thought of closing out those segments by grabbing their notes and ripping them up has never even crossed my mind.
- To Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders is bad because she and her buddies in Congress don't 'like' him.
- The bottom line is this: It is not, in a country that was founded on the values of individual liberty and personal responsibility, the job of the government (read: completely uninvolved taxpayers) to pay for someone else's mistake.

- Fall means that all of the Joy of Summer is officially over, and all of those hack fall activities that people seem to pretend to enjoy to make themselves feel better begin.

- I'm all for teaching about important concepts like consent; I'm also very aware of how damaging and destructive it can be to be a victim of sexual harassment.

- Keeping some people behind bars often hurts more than it helps - not only for the people who had been incarcerated and their families but also for society in general.
- Trump and his supporters often lambast news sources such as CNN as being the 'fake-news media' whose only goal is to take him down, and they're really doing themselves no favors when they say things that seem to support that.

- Too many people don't look at things objectively and try to see the facts; they instead look at them through their partisan lenses and try to figure out how to twist or spin them to fit their own 'side.'
- Personally, I chose my own undergraduate institution in large part because the scholarship options made it affordable for me to attend. Make no mistake: The financial feasibility of each school's cost was a major part of making my decision, as it was for almost everyone I knew.
