quotes = ['''I know from growing up in the spotlight, as it were, that the most important thing is your family.''' ,'''It ultimately becomes an asset to be part of a theatrical family if, indeed, you're good at what you do.''' ,'''I have a tendency as an actress in general to ground my characters.

I had played leading ladies before but couldn't really hook into them. After 'An American Daughter' and 'Beauty Queen', I had all the ballast.''' ,'''I recurred on 'Grey's Anatomy' for three years, and at the same time, I recurred for eight episodes on 'Rescue Me'.

Frankly, the guest star is often the most compelling character.''' ,'''I was lucky enough to be able to grow and mature in a natural way as an actress.''' ,'''I made a very concerted decision to go to drama school in the United States. But I did have the opportunity to go to Britain's Central School of Speech and Drama, and my dad and I had a few tense words about that. He wanted me to go to British drama school.''' ,'''For me, hour-long drama was always the thing I felt the most comfortable doing, and I've played so many dramatic roles in the theater.''' ,]
