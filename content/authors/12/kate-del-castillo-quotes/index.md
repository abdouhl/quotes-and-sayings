- I'm always trying to push for women's rights.
- I am a leader in my own world. That's enough for me.
- I like challenges, I like that fear you feel for something new, and with a new director, I think it's very important to always support new projects.
- I like men who are intelligent and sensitive.
- In terms of relationships, I've had two failures, although I don't like to call them failures; they are self learning, and I cannot say I regret any of my relationships. I've always said that I am a much loved woman.
- I love drama. Drama is, like, my thing. I want a movie that will move something inside me, that's going to shift something and keep me thinking.
- I don't care where I have to go for work. I just care that it's a good project. That's what I want.
- I will always be an actress. I couldn't see myself without acting. But I'd love to direct and keep writing. I don't think one has to be in place of the other.
- I do not see myself, I never make plans, I never set goals, and I never do that kind of stuff; I don't like to futurize, I barely know what I will do tomorrow, and because there is a working plan here, I've never futurized because life always surprises me with things even better.
- My job is to create myself a career that I can go to sleep satisfied with what I'm doing.
- If you're black, if you're gay, if you're Latin - we're all the same. We're all the same, and we all want the same: We want to be happy.
- I give 110% while I am working. I know I do, because I have been doing this since I was nine. This is a way of life for me. So whether it be successful or not is not in my hands. I still do my job, the best I can.
- I started in movies in Mexico and started doing telenovelas in Mexico. 'American Family' was the first thing I did in English.
- When not working, I use a lot of treatments; from ancient casero - honey, avocado, stuff like that - other times, I buy ones you leave on for a few minutes. I don't blow dry my hair ever unless for work; I'd rather go for the natural look.
- I have been very fortunate in my life. I think I have an angel that is always with me. Good projects always come to me.
- Unfortunately we - and I'm speaking not for Latin America but for Mexico because that's where I come from - we still, I think, are a little bit macho. Not that we only live in a macho world, but we also think as a macho world; even the women, you know? The women in Mexico, because that's the way we were raised.
- I'm interested in seeking projects no matter where, no matter if it is in the United States, whether in Chile, whether in Venezuela.
- First, I eat healthy; it comes from the inside out. If you eat right, your skin, hair, nails will look good. The same if you have negative thoughts - they can give you a bad look, too; we reflect what we eat and think. We also taste and smell what we eat. Being happy and doing what I love really reflects.
- I've always wanted my own fragrance; Avon pairs with the way I think: what they do and represent, what they do for women, and the good causes such as domestic violence, and breast cancer.
- For me, I never take a job thinking it's going to grab ratings or that it's even going to be a success. I don't. I just take the job because I love the character. Or I love the script. Maybe I love the director. But whatever I do, I never think about how it will do. That is not in my hands.
