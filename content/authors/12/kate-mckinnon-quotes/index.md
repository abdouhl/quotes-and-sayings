- I do get approached occasionally, but not a ton. I'm unrecognizable because I'm coated in cat hair and sweat. And there's a sort of yeti quality to my presence... so I don't think that people can see the face.
- If you asked me to seriously kiss someone on a screen, I would be very uncomfortable. But I will lick any part of your face.

- I've never had a couch that needed to be cleaned or learned how to couch-clean in general. That feels too grown-up.
- I had this dream in my head of, if I got hired by 'SNL, what that moment would be like. And I dreamed that I would, like, collapse on the sidewalk and cry to the heavens. I got this call, and it didn't happen naturally. But I did it anyway because I wanted to have that moment. So I did collapse.
- It's hard to write a comedy sketch.
- I only come up with things when I am talking to myself, which I do constantly. The sidewalk and the subway are the best places for this. I speak at full volume and then laugh at myself if I like what I just said.
- For an impression, I just find that I can do a lot of the people I love without much research, because I've already watched hours and hours of them on video and it seeped into my brain while I wasn't thinking about it.
- It's such an insult that foul gas comes out of a hole in our butt with a sound to announce itself. It's the ultimate bad thing about being a person.
- I admire my boss, Lorne Michaels. He never stops producing. I think, for him, comedy is a tool of compassion, a way of rallying people together and saying, 'Guys, isn't the world bonkers? Aren't we all just trying our best?' There's a tenderness in everything he does.

- I find donating stuff to be the biggest hassle.
- I was very serene, and I still am, until I start talking in another voice, then suddenly I have a lot of volume and I'm frantic. But I didn't want to be one of those people who's always talking in accents in real life, so I started doing sketch comedy.

- My couch is made of cat's hair. The cushions have been obscured, and it's made of salt-and-pepper fur. I can't have visitors. I can't ask people to sit on that couch because they become implicated in the furriness of it, and they're walking around, and it's not fair to people.

- I started watching 'SNL' when I was thirteen or so; those were the Molly Shannon/Ana Gasteyer/Cheri Oteri years.
- Maddie Ziegler is the most amazing dancer I've ever seen, and I'm so obsessed with her. I was obsessed with her even before she did her first Sia video.
- I worked as a telemarketer for an SAT-prep company. That was the worst of it, because I had to call people in post-Katrina New Orleans and offer them this very, very expensive SAT class. And I'm not even a good salesman.
- Comedy is a tool of togetherness. It's a way of putting your arm around someone, pointing at something, and saying, 'Isn't it funny that we do that?' It's a way of reaching out.
- My mom watches really obscure stuff on IFC. She's a real comedy fan. She knows everything that's going on.

- Nothing makes me laugh more than farting.

- I hope to be on 'SNL' as long as they'll let me.
- There was just a lot of comedy on the TV in the house, and my parents are both very funny.
- I don't sleep enough, and it does... what is the opposite of wonders... horrors. It does horrors for my skin.
- It's much easier for me to do an impression of someone real, because you and the audience begin with a baseline understanding of this person's life. And then if you subvert that in any way, it's a little comedy surprise.

Who the heck came up with that? It is such a good idea, such a unique combination of stuff from different genres. Ghosts and sci fi.
- I work with some of the funniest writers in the country.
- I love doing impressions of politicians because the task is always to imagine the private lives of these people whose job it is to project an image of staunch, unflinching leadership and grace, and that's just not how human beings, in their heart of hearts, work.
- A good impression is sort of a juxtaposition of disparate elements.
- I think that any sort of fantasy or sci fi that is grounded in something that could ostensibly be real - 'Jurassic Park' being my favorite example - is that much more prescient because it means that much more. Maybe one day, what if?
- I've been told I'm a little bit eccentric.
- When I heard that Paul Feig was directing an all-female 'Ghostbusters,' I was prepared to do anything to be a part of this, to be a part of what sounded like an incredible project.
