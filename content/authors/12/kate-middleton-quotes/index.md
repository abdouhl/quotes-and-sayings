quotes = ['''I think as any mother would be she was absolutely over the moon. And actually we had quite an awkward situation because I knew and I knew that William had asked my father but I didn't know if my mother knew.''' ,'''Change the way we all talk to each other about our mental health.''' ,'''With the right help, children have a good chance of overcoming their issues while they are still young and can have the bright future they deserve.''' ,'''I don't know if I have a favorite color.''' ,'''If any of us caught a fever during pregnancy, we would seek advice and support from a doctor. Getting help with our mental health is no different - our children need us to look after ourselves and get the support we need.''' ,'''Imagine if everyone was able to help just one child who needs to be listened to, needs to be respected, and needs to be loved - we could make such a huge difference for an entire generation.''' ,'''Parenting is tough.''' ,'''Personally, becoming a mother has been such a rewarding and wonderful experience. However, at times it has also been a huge challenge. Even for me who has support at home that most mothers do not.''' ,'''No, I had the Levis guy on my wall, not a picture of William, sorry.''' ,'''There is no rule book, no right or wrong; you just have to make it up and do the very best you can to care for your family.''' ,'''We need to help young people and their parents understand that it's not a sign of weakness to ask for help.''' ,'''William and I feel that every child deserves to be supported through difficult times in their lives.''' ,'''Sadly, for some mothers, this experience can be made so much harder due to challenges with our very mental health.''' ,'''Not all children have the anchor of a strong family.''' ,'''It is our duty, as parents and as teachers, to give all children the space to build their emotional strength and provide a strong foundation for their future.''' ,'''There's no one quite like William - I bet he's really kind. You can just tell by looking at him.''' ,'''I can remember being at Sandringham, for the first time, at Christmas. And I was worried what to give the Queen as her Christmas present. I was thinking, 'Gosh, what should I give her?'. I thought, 'I'll make her something.' Which could have gone horribly wrong. But I decided to make my granny's recipe of chutney.''' ,'''Together with open conversations and greater understanding, we can ensure that attitudes for mental health change and children receive the support they deserve.''' ,'''It's obviously nerve-wracking, because I don't know the ropes really, William is obviously used to it, but I'm willing to learn quickly and work hard.''' ,'''Having a child, particularly your first child, is such a life-changing moment. Nothing can really prepare you for that.''' ,'''I am sure you will agree that all children deserve time, attention, and love from the adults in their lives. These basic qualities are so much more valuable than the always-changing material and social concerns that can seem so important to young people.''' ,'''We have seen that two heads are better than one when dealing with a mental health problem.''' ,'''I hope we will be able to have a happy family ourselves.''' ,'''We have heard time and time again in the course of our work how talking can help heal the hidden challenges we can't deal with alone.''' ,'''No parent would fail to call the doctor if their child developed a fever.''' ,'''I find doing speeches nerve wrecking.''' ,'''When I first visited the Hospice in Milton, I had a pre-conceived idea as to what to expect. Far from being a clinical, depressing place for sick children, it was a home. Most importantly, it was a family home, a happy place of stability, support and care. It was a place of fun.''' ,'''The most memorable engagement for me, I suppose, was an away-day to Leicester. I went without William, so I was rather apprehensive about that.''' ,'''Well I think if you really go out with someone for quite a long time you do get to know each other very, very well, you go through the good times, you go through the bad times. You know both personally, but also within a relationship as well.''' ,'''Some children are tackling tough times without the support that can help them because the adults in their life are scared to ask.''' ,'''I was quite nervous about meeting William's father, but he was very, very welcoming, very friendly, it couldn't have gone easier really for me.''' ,'''We hope to encourage George and Charlotte to speak about their feelings, and to give them the tools and sensitivity to be supportive peers to their friends as they get older.''' ,'''Throughout my work with family and child support organizations, one thing that has stood out to me time and again is that getting early support for a child who is struggling to cope is the best possible thing we can do to help our children as they grow up.''' ,'''Parents, teachers, and other school staff need the tools to help these young people early in their lives. And the earlier, the better. It is proven that early action prevents problems later in life.''' ,'''We want to encourage people to talk to one another.''' ,'''Around-the-clock support is crucial for children receiving palliative care. They and their families often need help every hour of every day, both in hospices and at home.''' ,'''Everyone teases me in the family that I spend far too long chatting.

I am looking forward to helping as much as I can.''' ,'''I feel very, very lucky that George has got a little sister.''' ,'''From taking photographs of George and Charlotte, I have been struck by the wonderful lack of self-consciousness that you see in photographs of children, without the self-awareness that adults generally feel.''' ,'''When I was growing up, I was very lucky. My family was the most important thing to me. They provided me with somewhere safe to grow and learn, and I know I was fortunate not to have been confronted by serious adversity at a young age.''' ,'''Around a third of parents still worry that they will look like a bad mother or father if their child has a mental health problem. Parenting is hard enough without letting prejudices stop us from asking for the help we need for ourselves and our children.''' ,'''Nothing can really prepare you for you the sheer overwhelming experience of what it means to become a mother. It is full of complex emotions of joy, exhaustion, love, and worry, all mixed together.''' ,'''It's very special having a new little girl.''' ,'''The challenge that so many people have is not knowing how to take that first step of reaching out to another person for help.''' ,'''First-class delivery of children's palliative care is life-changing. When families are confronted with the shattering news that their children have a life-limiting condition, their world can fall apart.''' ,'''Addiction is a hugely complex and destructive disease, and its impact can be simply devastating. All too often, lives and families can be shattered by it.''' ,'''A child who has overcome challenges with proper emotional support will emerge stronger.''' ,'''Actually William wasn't there for quite a bit of the time initially, he wasn't there for Freshers Week, so it did take a bit of time for us to get to know each other but we did become very close friends from quite early.''' ,'''All of us know someone who has been through difficult emotional times, and we know how hard it can be to see a way forward.''' ,'''I often get asked why I decided to spend time highlighting the mental health of children.''' ,'''George loves the T Rex because it's the noisiest and the scariest.''' ,'''No one would feel embarrassed about seeking help for a child if they broke their arm - and we really should be equally ready to support a child coping with emotional difficulties.''' ,'''I'm still very much Kate.''' ,'''Every child deserves to grow up knowing their potential and feeling confident that they won't fall at the first hurdle - that they cope with life's setbacks.''' ,'''I think there is a real art to walkabouts.''' ,'''I was lucky. My parents and teachers provided me with a wonderful and secure childhood where I always knew I was loved, valued, and listened to.''' ,'''Being able to go into Wimbledon and be part of an amazing atmosphere is special.''' ,'''Since beginning my work in areas like addiction, for example, I have seen time and time again that the roots of poor mental health in adulthood are almost always present in unresolved childhood challenges.''' ,'''I have learned that delivering the best possible palliative care to children is vital, providing children and their families with a place of support, care and enhancement at a time of great need is simply life-changing.''' ,'''I think I know I've been working very hard for the family business, sometimes those days are long days and I think if I know I'm working hard and pulling my weight, both working and playing hard at the same time, I think everyone who I work with can see I am there pulling my weight.''' ,'''My parents taught me about the importance of qualities like kindness, respect, and honesty, and I realize how central values like these have been to me throughout my life.''' ,'''The Queen was really thrilled that we'd had a little girl, and when we came back here to Kensington, she was one of her first visitors.''' ,'''A child's mental health is just as important as their physical health and deserves the same quality of support.''' ,'''I think, the people around home are very supportive to us.''' ,'''Every time Wimbledon is on, I am thinking, 'Yes, I could do the same and get out the racket.' Sadly, not the same results.''' ,'''By far the best dressing up outfit I ever had was a wonderful pair of clown dungarees, which my Granny made.''' ,]
