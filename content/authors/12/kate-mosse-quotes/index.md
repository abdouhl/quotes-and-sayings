- I am not a fan of historical fiction that is sloppy in its research or is dishonest about the real history.
- I really like people and I keep friendships. I have people from all parts of my life.
- Usually I decide on what it is I'm writing next by the books I'm reading.
- Library campaigners are not prepared to stand by and watch something they cherish be dismantled brick by brick.
- I read a lot of thrillers, especially American crime novels.
- Lots of people have objections to prizes of all types, and it would be extraordinary if everybody agreed on anything that's worthwhile - they never do.
- People have different views of how you deal with different issues in literature, and, frankly, long may it last that there is a range of views.
- All prizes have a role, if they are run with integrity and with a clear focus on reading and quality writing. I don't think any of them is necessary, but they all play an incredibly important role in building a body of literature, in introducing new authors to new readers, and extending reading.
- The message is clear: libraries matter. Their solid presence at the heart of our towns sends the proud signal that everyone - whoever they are, whatever their educational background, whatever their age or their needs - is welcome.
- Actually, I can write anywhere - airport lounges, in bed, on a rattling train going north.
- Free and fair access to books - to reading - is a right and one we should fight for.
- People think that I'm very serious.
