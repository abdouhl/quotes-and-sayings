I can't write clever songs; I just can't do it.''' ,'''I would say that I'm opinionated and clumsy and I am definitely led by my heart over my head.''' ,'''As many problems as there are with Hollywood, I feel so much more protected because if there's a serious issue, I have someone I can talk to.

I don't want everyone to like me.''' ,'''The Trachtenburg Family Slideshow Players are the most wonderful creatures.''' ,'''One day when I was 14 I put together a makeshift CV and walked into this weird boutique in Pinner, near where I lived, to ask if they needed a Saturday assistant. They didn't, but the owner took me on anyway.''' ,'''A woman's body and a woman's image is a very political thing, so I trust another woman to understand what that's like and how to portray it in a way people can relate to.''' ,'''When you earn your own money you feel much better about yourself.''' ,'''The Walking Dead' is my show.

A lot of the time I'm either performing or travelling - so what I wear is either really fun or just really comfortable. For anything in between I think, 'Oh God, I don't know how to dress myself. But when I get on stage I'm just like, 'I can wear anything I want!'''' ,'''My parents would, like, argue in front of us and it wasn't a big deal, whereas I know some people's parents who, if they argued, it was like, 'Oh, my God.'''' ,'''I didn't feel like I was allowed to be a songwriter.
