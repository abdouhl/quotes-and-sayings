Why do we think that people who have less should find it edifying?''' ,'''I think it's this congenital problem with journalism that we oversell the difference we make. We make small differences.''' ,'''I was spending a lot of time in Mumbai after I met my husband, who is Indian, and while parts of the city were prospering like crazy, I couldn't quite make out how the new wealth had changed the prospects of the majority of city residents who lived in slums. So after a few years I stopped wondering and started reporting.''' ,'''In any country, corruption tends to increase when more respectable means of social advancement break down.''' ,'''I have been dealing with illness and its manifestations since I was a teenager, and I think that gives me a very healthy respect for the things in life we can't control.''' ,'''One thing that was very clear to me is that the young people in a place like Annawadi aren't tripping on caste the way their parents are.

Maybe there are some things at work in deciding who gets to be society's winners and who gets to be society's losers that don't have to do with merit.''' ,'''A great deal of what is presumed to be intractable or inevitable in this world doesn't strike me that way at all.''' ,'''I'm useless when I meet writers I love - I go slack-jawed and stupid with awe.''' ,'''I'm not squeamish.''' ,'''When your work is nonfiction about low-income communities, pretty much anything that's not nonfiction about low-income communities feels like a guilty pleasure.''' ,'''People naturally long for a bit of the wealth that is whorling all around them, and if the work and education available to them won't get them closer to the comforts that they see others enjoying, the temptation to take shortcuts can be fierce.''' ,'''We often have an exaggerated sense of what nonprofits and governments are doing to help the poor, but the really inspiring thing is how much the poor are doing to help themselves.''' ,]
