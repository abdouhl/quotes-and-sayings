- I've done a lot of independent films that not a lot of people have seen.
- I had a dream, when I was little, to become a police officer and a crime investigator.

- I love Nike's running shoes and clothes because they feel as light as a feather.
- I get cast at the last minute. I don't know, maybe somebody drops out and they can't get someone, and someone is like, 'Oh, how about Katia Winter?'
