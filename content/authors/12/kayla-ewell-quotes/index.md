quotes = ['''I eat hamburgers all the time.''' ,'''I used to date Kellan Lutz. We were together for two and a half years, but the distance and travel really kept us apart. In the end, we decided it wouldn't work, but we're still good friends.''' ,'''I'm sort of a gym buff. It's a stress relief for me. But I only go for 20 minutes at a time.''' ,'''My all-time favorite is Brad Pitt in 'Interview with the Vampire.' He's so sexy.

There's something super sexy about someone who has to feed to survive but doesn't want to do it.''' ,'''I'm one of the only actresses in Los Angeles who has never waited tables - yet - and I'm so terrible at holding trays. When we shot the 'Vampire Diaries' pilot, I totally spilled water all down Nina Dobrev, and she had to get her hair and make-up redone.''' ,'''I'm a sucker for accents and any man who can actually sing and serenade you.''' ,'''Nowadays, everyone broadcasts everything about their life - I think vampires are really sexy because there's so much that you don't know about them. There's a lot of mystery.''' ,]
