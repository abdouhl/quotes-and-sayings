quotes = ['''Opting for conspiracy over facts and partisanship over constitutional principles, Democrats have chosen to ignore the damning evidence of wrongdoing by the Obama-era FBI.''' ,'''Having the ability to inspire a crowd and connect with voters doesn't mean a person has the skills to appease those same voters once in office.''' ,'''I live free of fear and full of hope.''' ,'''Neither an almost $35 million Mueller investigation, ending in an exonerating report, nor a sham impeachment effort could deter Trump from moving forward with the business of the American people.''' ,'''Hope springs eternal, even for hopeless crusades.''' ,'''While the left will attempt to drown out Trump's political accomplishments with unfounded allegations of Russian collusion, the voters who made Trump commander-in-chief will likely reach a different conclusion. Trump has proven himself loyal to the voters who put him there.''' ,'''As a Donald Trump supporter, the battle to elevate the will of the people above that of the establishment is one with which I empathize.''' ,'''In the 1980s, Democrats enthusiastically helped President Reagan pass his tax reforms, which made the tax system fairer and more efficient in addition to reducing rates.''' ,'''Bastions of free-flowing discussion with civil exchange are the academic ideal. But during my time in academia, it became increasingly clear that prisons of political correctness with peer-engendered public shaming are now the academic reality.''' ,'''The punditry snicker, the politicians sneer, and the editorialists scoff, but the American people speak and Donald J. Trump rises - commandingly so - confounding the powerful institutions of Washington D.C. and New York and earning him the ire of both.''' ,'''Nothing could be more contrary to American values than the mob-like mentality and socialist precepts pushed by the far left. They seek nothing less than the complete destruction of the basis on which America was founded.''' ,'''The Democrats have shown little interest in legislating, but unlimited interested in investigating every aspect of President Trump's life. It's a wonder they haven't subpoenaed his elementary school report cards.''' ,'''The truth is on the side of President Trump.''' ,'''At certain moments, both the WEEE Act and the First Step Act appeared doomed to dead end in partisan gridlock and procedural hurdles.''' ,'''The left's panic and politicization of the coronavirus is not unusual. It is the typical reaction for a party and a media hoping desperately to see the end of the Trump presidency.''' ,'''The Democrats' radicalism does not end with illegal immigration and health care. It extends into other aspects of their policy platforms.''' ,'''When you reach across the aisle and open your heart and mind, you might just find that you have more in common than you think with the guy on the other side of the fence.''' ,'''There is simply no denying the continued success of the Trump economy.''' ,'''Donald Trump has come under fire for recommending U.S. citizens accused of terrorism be prosecuted before military tribunals. But despite the criticism, Trump's concerns are not only merited - they are, in fact, within the bounds of the law.''' ,'''I admit that, for the first month of his candidacy, I had my concerns about Trump. I questioned, for example, whether someone with such cutting yet candid honesty, a candidate who veered so sharply from so many of the usual political expectations, could ever become president.''' ,'''Perhaps the seemingly never-ending quest by Democrats to delegitimize the will of the American people and the election of Trump as president was really designed to distract from what we now know to be true: In 2016, the only presidential campaign that colluded with foreign nationals, Russia included, was the Clinton campaign.''' ,'''A vote for Donald J. Trump is a vote for renewed American greatness.''' ,'''Thankfully, President Trump doesn't just complain about problems - he solves them.''' ,'''False allegations of racism, bigotry, xenophobia, anti-Semitism, and now lying each have their own chapter in the Trump takedown playbook.''' ,'''The United States is a constitutional republic, and the Founding Fathers fought to ensure that the mob couldn't undermine it.''' ,'''Both at home and abroad, Ivanka Trump has been a strong and confident advocate for female equality.''' ,'''When the President acts, he must do so pursuant to constitutionally enumerated Article II powers or statutory power allocated to him by Congress.''' ,'''The media's apoplectic reaction to 2018 tax refunds displays a fundamental misunderstanding of the U.S. tax code and the very notion of what a refund actually is.''' ,'''To compare the United States of America - the beacon of the free world - to the brutal North Korean dictatorship is as insulting as it is asinine.''' ,'''Together, the WEEE Act and the First Step Act represented two rare examples of Republicans and Democrats coming together to make meaningful change.''' ,'''President Donald Trump set out to drain the Washington swamp, and perhaps no one has aided him more effectively than senior adviser Jared Kushner.''' ,'''Having spent years in academia - at Georgetown University School of Foreign Service, Oxford University and Harvard Law School - I encountered a wide range of worldviews.''' ,'''In offering deals on immigration, infrastructure, and prison reform, President Trump has demonstrated that he is ready for compromise. But will Democrats take up his offer?''' ,'''Prison reform, peace, and a presidential pardon - just a portion of Kushner's portfolio.''' ,'''Though you may not have heard much about it, Kushner is working with steadfast focus on advocating for the American people, bringing government and its technology into alignment with the people's needs and finally ending the Washington swamp's status quo.''' ,'''While Democrats spent the year of 2019 obstructing, President Trump spent the year achieving.''' ,'''Rather than depriving Trump of political victories, Democrats ought to focus on delivering victories for the American people.''' ,'''Smaller tax refunds are not a bad thing - they're a sign that people are keeping more of their money as they earn it, rather than letting Uncle Sam keep it under his mattress for them.''' ,'''My post-mastectomy life is not one embattled but emboldened.''' ,'''House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., whose youthful dreams of being a successful Hollywood screenwriter never materialized, is proving to the world that he does indeed have a talent for concocting fictional stories.''' ,'''You don't need to be a trained investigator to grasp the blatantly obvious fact that the funding of the Steele dossier by Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign is a crucial piece of information that should have been revealed to the FISA Court.''' ,'''Kushner is the victim of exaggerated speculation supported by little evidence. Because of his affiliation with the Trump White House and the Trump family, he is subject to the perverse standard of guilty until proven innocent. It is a grotesque miscarriage of justice indeed.''' ,'''One of the left's favorite refrains is falsely caricaturing Republican candidates as 'racist' and 'xenophobic,' throwing out 'dog whistles' to fuel racial sentiments.''' ,'''The Fourth Amendment protects the privacy of us all - from ordinary citizens up to candidates for president. If we allow this precious right to be ignored when dealing with a presidential campaign, it can be ignored when dealing with the rest of us.''' ,'''Whatever your partisan affiliation, it is worth considering the overarching constitutional principles involved in any given Supreme Court precedent.''' ,'''The American public recognizes truth versus assumption, presumptions, and the personal opinions of witnesses without firsthand knowledge.''' ,'''The radicalized populace in liberal havens like California and New York seek to impose their socialist utopian ideology on those law-abiding, everyday Americans who live in what elite, coastal liberals derisively refer to as 'flyover country.'''' ,'''The very welfare state the Occupy Wall Street protesters so eagerly applaud is what has saddled Greece with colossal debt and left its economy on the brink of collapse, igniting violent protests across the nation.''' ,'''The coronavirus has yet again exposed the strong contrast between President Trump - who is working ardently for the American people - and a Democratic Party with little interest in anything besides taking him down. President Trump, for his part, has taken unprecedented action to thwart the spread of the virus.''' ,'''The Trump administration recognizes that most refugees and immigrants are good people, but practical and temporary measures must be taken to keep this nation safe from the few bad individuals who seek to harm us.''' ,'''I imagine the Wall Street protesters would embrace Greece's unusually generous benefits and massive welfare state, which were put in place by Socialist Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou in the 1980s.''' ,'''When choosing the president of the United States and the leader of the free world, your desire to have a beer with a candidate should be your last concern. Let's keep our president in the Oval Office and out of the bars.''' ,'''Far from being imbeciles, as the left would have you believe, Trump has assembled a Cabinet of the nation's best. This, of course, is unpalatable to the Washington elite, who only find worth in a long list of public sector titles.''' ,'''Liberals tried to oust Attorney General Jeff Sessions when news emerged that his congressional testimony did not clearly articulate his minimal, par-for-the-course communications with the Russian ambassador while he was a Senator.''' ,'''If the Democrats want to make an efficacy or merit-based argument with respect to the Electoral College, then by all means make it. It ought to be based in history and fact not fanciful revisionist history, and it should be made not just during an election year because of discontent with the electoral outcome.''' ,'''On the morning of May 1, 2018, I woke up knowing that the day I had anticipated for nine years had finally arrived. It was the day of my preventative double mastectomy - the day I would attack my BRCA 2 genetic mutation head-on and take my chances of breast cancer from 84 percent to virtually zero.''' ,'''In reality, if Democrats truly cared about solutions to our immigration crisis they would have done so long ago - like in 2009, when they controlled the entire federal government and maintained a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate.''' ,'''The presidential race should not be a battle of personalities.''' ,'''My political career began on the other side of the fence from the liberal filmmaker Michael Moore - both literally and figuratively. As a young intern for the Bush-Cheney 2004 campaign, I was tasked with attending a Moore rally four days before the general election.''' ,'''Rather than embracing mainstream, majority-held positions, 2020 Democratic presidential candidates have made it exceedingly clear that they will sacrifice themselves on the altar of the radical left - endorsing positions held by a select few and fueling an unstoppable tailwind behind President Trump's reelection.''' ,'''In its early days, Trump's presidency ought to be viewed as the arduous start to the complicated task of draining the Washington swamp.''' ,'''The First Step Act, the WEEE Act, and President Trump's infrastructure and immigration compromise plans all serve as examples of Trump administration outreach to the Democrats.''' ,'''Democrats, for their part, have chosen to go the way of reckless obstruction, pursuing the first partisan impeachment in history.''' ,'''The 'inability to have a dialogue' is increasingly the norm in academia. Conservative thought is not just unwelcome, oftentimes it is banished altogether.''' ,'''Unlike the Obama Cabinet, the Trump Cabinet is not comprised of do-nothing bureaucrats, who worked their way up the twisted, scheme-ridden Washington ladder; rather, they are doers, achievers, and leaders, who have attained the heights of greatness in their particular fields.''' ,'''Schiff has pre-scripted a televised production titled 'The Impeachment Inquiry Against President Trump.' The story would likely be deemed too absurd and too boring to make it onto the silver screen as a drama, though it might succeed as a comedic farce - too silly to be taken seriously.''' ,'''It's easy to dismiss terrorism and point to its rarity, until someone you know and love becomes a victim of it.''' ,'''While women were finally given the right to vote in the United States with the ratification of the 19th Amendment in 1920, the Republican Party began to pave the way for women's suffrage decades earlier.''' ,'''Through strategic diplomacy, private-public sector partnerships, and innovative new ideas, the Trump administration has advanced policies that will benefit millions of working families here in the United States and abroad.''' ,'''Should the high court be able to roll back state health regulations whose efficacy was at least debatable? If your answer is yes, logical consistency should encourage you to apply this same logic to the court's consideration of state-level gun control.''' ,'''To be sure, most immigrants are good and most Muslims are peaceful.''' ,'''If you think a candidate is electable and has the adeptness to be president, that's one thing. Elect him for these factors, not because he's likeable.''' ,'''The bedrock principle of separation of powers ought to be upheld regardless of the (D) or (R) that rests behind a given president's name.''' ,'''The radical Left wants control over the lives of the American people and will sink to any depths to get it.''' ,'''President Trump has doubled the Child Tax Credit and added thousands back into the average Americans' paycheck through tax cuts and wage growth.''' ,'''Shortly after assuming the role of senior adviser in the Trump White House, world leaders began to take note of Ivanka Trump's ability to engage in diplomacy effectively - a skill she has consistently used to help benefit women in the workplace.''' ,'''Whether black or white, we are all Americans, and we should stand united against the horrid and tragic loss of one of our brothers. Anything less is simply not the American way.''' ,'''America's bastions of free thought have become hubs of suppression. If you're on the left, riot in the streets without repercussion. But if you're on the right, speak at your own peril.''' ,'''TThe 2016 election highlighted a deep, stark divide between how the political and punditry class think - and how the American people vote.''' ,'''With regard to the Constitution, the power to create 'a uniform rule of naturalization' does not rest in Article II, but in Article I, making it a power of Congress and not the President.''' ,'''Sadly, some seem unable to accept that maybe what America needs is someone who will level with voters, and who isn't shy about presenting things as they are, not like we would necessarily like them to be. That is no truer than on U.S. college campuses.''' ,'''Though many in the media do their best to conceal the achievements of President Trump on behalf of women, we are confident that women nationwide have taken notice and will use the 100th anniversary of women's suffrage to reelect President Trump on November 3, 2020.''' ,'''With little fanfare, Jared Kushner is quietly tackling Washington's slow, outdated modus operandi while simultaneously engaging in high-level diplomacy that promotes America's interests on the world stage.''' ,'''In 1984, Geraldine Ferraro made history by participating in the first male-on-female vice presidential debate against George H. W. Bush. What should have been a groundbreaking moment for gender equality in politics became a forum for old gender expectations.''' ,'''President Trump is enforcing U.S. immigration law, and in doing so, protecting the well-being and in some cases the lives of U.S. citizens.''' ,'''The night before my mastectomy, I had done my best to keep my mind off of the impending procedure. My family and I went to the Tampa Bay Lightning hockey game, where I binged on pizza and ice cream and took full advantage of the doctor's advice to eat up the night before since I had to begin fasting at midnight.''' ,'''Flanked on both sides, organized forces on the Left and the Right have made every effort to topple Trump, but these efforts have only served to embolden him and broaden his support.''' ,'''We all know the story of the prodigal son. Confident he knows what is best for him, he recklessly squanders his inheritance. The Occupy Wall Streeters are just that, the prodigal protesters.''' ,'''From aloof academics to career government cronies, President Barack Obama filled his Cabinet with individuals whose greatest achievements were dreaming up unworkable Democratic utopias from the far off perches of academia and Washington bureaucracy.''' ,'''Sensationalism is entertaining, but substance is what matters.''' ,'''History suggests that opposite gender debates, unfortunately, are accompanied by a host of expectations. Each candidate must tread carefully or risk running afoul of the gender stereotype they are subconsciously expected to conform to.''' ,'''President Trump, along with Senior Advisers Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump, have shown their willingness to extend an olive branch to Democrats.''' ,'''The Electoral College is provided for in Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution. More space in the Constitution is devoted to laying out the Electoral College than to any other concept in the document.''' ,'''Indeed, President Trump has proven himself the professional - the adult in the room as Democrats act like small children, incapable of stepping up to the task at hand and certainly incapable of leading the nation.''' ,'''It is clear that the radical left has taken over the Democratic Party, leaving behind the party of John F. Kennedy.''' ,'''The truth is liberals are using every tactic possible to drown the Trump presidency.''' ,'''Since the election of President-elect Donald Trump, Democrats have repeatedly blamed everyone and everything for the loss of Hillary Clinton except for Clinton herself.''' ,'''Donald Trump became President of the United States because of a simple but potent combination of promises: draining the swamp, building the wall, correcting free trade imbalances, and making America great again.''' ,'''We as Americans should all be concerned with the smearing of the Trump administration and unfounded allegations of collusion with the Russians.''' ,'''Home to some of our nation's civil rights leaders, Harvard Law is not a bigoted hub of racism but a place where men and women of all races peacefully co-exist in pursuit of higher education.''' ,]
