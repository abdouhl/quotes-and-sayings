- If I was ambitious in my career, then I would have moved to the United States and given it a good go at films.
- My beauty regime is very simple. I just take my make-up off before bed. And oh, I always put moisturiser on. But that's about it, apart from a bit of soap maybe.
- 'Upstairs Downstairs' and 'Downton Abbey' appeal to people because they're about our history, they look so beautiful, are written by amazing writers and have high production values.
- In the adverts, I look like I do because 150 people have spent seven hours making me look dazzling. That's not me at all.
- My husband is the chef of the family; he's a brilliant cook. Actually, it makes you quite lazy when you have somebody that's so good at cooking under the same roof. It's all beans or spaghetti when I'm left to run it.
- I'm a size 12 and I'm very happy with it.
- We're not an acting family, but my parents have always encouraged me.
- I've never seen an episode of 'Downton Abbey.'
- There have been times in my life when I have felt like I can't go out without my makeup on. But now I just put on some dark glasses so people can't see if I look rough!
- I worked in McDonald's, but I didn't mind it. You got free cheeseburgers. I love eating a bit of junk food.
- It's very easy to keep putting off having a family if you enjoy your job, but you just have to get on with life.
- I prefer watching movies on the sofa rather than sitting next to Bob Geldof at a premiere and wanting to kill yourself.
- If there's room for 30 reality shows, surely there's room for two amazing costume dramas.
- I went on two holidays as a child. It wasn't what people did where I grew up.
- I don't punish myself. Life's too short.
- I've nothing against stay-at-home mums, but I love going to work, I love what I do and I wouldn't want to start resenting my home life if I was staying home 365 days a year.
- I hope to be still acting when I'm 70 on TV, film and theatre.
- Coming from a family where the parents had been together for 40 years, you never imagine that divorce is going to happen to you.
- I happen to know there is nothing sexy or romantic about love scenes. They are just awful to do.
- There are lots of actors who are posh and stick with that, and there are lots of actors who are cockney, and that's what they do. That's fine, but I don't think that could be said about me.
- When you think about such fine actors as Maggie Smith or Michael Gambon, they do all mediums. I think it would be quite sad and a bit dull just to have to stick to one. I like all of them.
- I do love playing aristocrats, probably because it's so against type. So much more interesting than playing a version of yourself.
- Something like a divorce does change you, but children change you more, and now I've had three.
- 'Ashes To Ashes' is a victim of its own success. We started lots of trends. I like to think we had something to do with bringing back the high waist. It's so much more flattering.
- There's always a sense of tragedy with icons. It happened to both the Princess of Wales and Diana Dors. A lot of people had grown up with them, and everybody loved them. Then, when they had at last found happiness, they were taken in the most dreadful way.
- The Turkish people are the friendliest I've ever met.
- I'm not saying that every night of the week, my husband, ex-husband, our children and I all sit around together like one big happy family. But we do see each other frequently, and everyone loves each other, and we are all friends.
- The funny thing about children is that, whichever room we're in, that's where they'll be. If I'm in the bath, they'll want to be in there too, playing with the toothbrush pot or brushing my hair.
- When I grew up in central London, we had six pavement slabs for a garden.
- There are all sorts of ways you can take somebody's identity or change your own, and a million things you can do with it once you have. It's quite incredible.
- When you get into your 40s, the roles do tend to drop off, and I've seen it happening to friends of mine. Hopefully it is improving, and there are female TV executives now who are championing women of all ages in leading roles. But I'm not counting on it.
- I don't like dirt. Cleanliness is high on my agenda, but I don't have a phobia of dirt. I'm just not keen on it. I don't really like dirty people or houses or smelly things.
- Botox and other fillers make everybody look the same, with the big cheekbones where they fill you up. It's much cheaper to have a fringe - it takes years off everybody.
- Things can change on a daily basis in television. You can be introduced to aspects of your character that you had no idea existed because they didn't exist a week before. The next week it might be taken away from you in some way that you can't control.
- I was never one of those teenagers who sang into their hairbrush.
- I've stopped worrying about whether people think what I do is any good. I've taken stick in the past, and I've genuinely worried and got incredibly upset.
- It's a healthy thing to get some bad criticism. I'm still here and I'm fine, but I'd be lying if I said it didn't get to you reading the negative stuff.
- Yes, I'm anal. I am just really organised.
- I love washing, hoovering, ironing, you name it. I find it very therapeutic.
- I have quite a lot of anxiety dreams.
- I love fashion; I adore it. I love the madness of it.
- I am not into action and adventure on holiday; that doesn't really do it for me. I would much rather go and lie down.
- Life is simply too short to think about everything you put in your mouth, and it's not good for children to see you picking over bits of salad.
- I'm a total stationery fiend - I have drawers and drawers of lovely printed cards and wrapping paper.
- My children have been all over the world, and I think it's so good for them: expanding their horizons and imagination and seeing how other people live.
- Marriage and being a mother are absolutely crucial to my happiness and my life.
- There's nowhere to hide in the theatre. You can't be the one in rehearsal who doesn't know their lines.
- Children will be children, and they're inquisitive. If teenagers want to know what's out there, they'll look, but there are things that aren't for their eyes.
- I think if you do a lot of interviews, you're laying yourself open. If you put yourself out, accept every invitation to every premiere, then you can't really complain when people knock on your front door and photograph you in the street.
