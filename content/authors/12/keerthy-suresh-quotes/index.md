- I like to prepare for my roles well, so you can call me a method actor to an extent.

- I don't take up too many projects at a time. I choose with care. I guess that clarity comes because my parents are from the industry.

- I don't want to be part of movies where I just sing and dance and go away.
- Going to a theatre and watching yourself on the big screen is a nightmare.
- After my schooling, I was not thrilled by the idea of treading the usual doctor-engineer line. I wanted to pursue something artistic, and I was good at drawing. The options before me were architecture, fashion, and interior designing.

- I have never behaved like a star kid, and since a lot of people in the Tamil and Malayalam film industries know my parents, they treat me like their own child.
- Fashion designing involves a lot of work, and, as opposed to the general perception, it is different from costume designing for films. While a fashion designer can take up a costume designer's role, it is not possible vice versa.
