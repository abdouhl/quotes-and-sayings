- Most people don't know that I'll eat anything spicy. A little extra kick is always a good thing!
- Most people don't know that I have a huge phobia of bugs. It's gotten worse and worse over the years, but I just can't stand them! Even thinking about bugs makes me queasy.
- Comedy has always been more challenging for me than drama.
- I had a great chemistry teacher and found it really interesting to learn how things are made up and how they work.
- No matter how busy I am, I find time for dance.
- As a teenage girl myself, I've gone through times in my life where I've felt insecure about who I am and have tried so hard to fit in with everyone else.
- I love Demi Lovato's style. It's really different, but it's super chic and has a cool edge to it. I'm always trying to channel her style when going shopping for new clothes or getting dressed in the morning.
- I would love to get into feature films; I'm willing to do an action flick, I'm willing to do a romantic comedy.
- I would love to work with Kristin Wiig one day. I find her hilarious, and I totally idolize her.
- I know that dancers, especially ballet dancers, can't do it forever.
- I would love to be able to read minds. How cool would it be to get inside peoples' heads and figure out what they're thinking? I guess that's a good and a bad thing.
- I think it'd be the coolest thing if I could get a role in a dance movie. That's something I'm always going to love.
- Going to work is probably my favorite thing to do. I do that five days a week for probably ten hours a day, but it doesn't even feel like work and it shouldn't. When you enjoy a job so much like I do, it's not work, it's play.
