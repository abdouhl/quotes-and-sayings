- Learning method acting might mess me up.
- As an artist, you reflect the world around you. To do that, you must dive in, take risks, fall on your face, win, and sometimes lose a great deal.
- I can't remember life before I was an actor. In fact, I was an actor before I knew what it was to be an actor.
- I want to know art.
- At college - I went to Yale, and everybody's very smart, and everybody has their thing that makes them special, and people at Yale would pretend they didn't recognize me. Only after they'd had a couple of drinks would they start singing the 'Life Goes On' theme song.
- As with real families, my fictional family on 'Life Goes On' had its ups and downs, and as part of the fictional downers, the actors were often called to cry on cue. This absolutely terrified me, because I was a pretty happy kid who didn't have much to cry about.
- I believe a child's most important job is to explore the world around them through play.
- I would say, if I had any hobbies, I love photography. I love taking photographs.
- Growing up, my friends played soccer or did gymnastics after school; I went on auditions with my mom.
- 'Christy' is worth staying out of college for because I believe in the show. I wouldn't stay out of college for many other shows.
- I think the takeaway is 'The Guest Book' is incredibly unexpected in every way. I know, when I was reading the script, I was surprised with every page turn. It's kind of an anthology, and it really pushed the envelope. It's a risk-taking show, and it's just a lot of fun.
- The way I choose parts is I look at the scripts... I choose a part by whether or not it challenges me.
- It's an extraordinary thing to do, to go into the military and to serve your country.
- Small towns are so rich.
- My kid really loves bugs.
- I want to become a very good writer.
- I wouldn't want to be a superstar, like Julia Roberts or Madonna, and be on the cover of 'US' magazine when I'm twenty - that's how you know you're really hot. I'd rather have a long, respected career.
- We go to Montana every year - that's where my husband is from - Flathead Lake, Montana, which is one of the most beautiful places I've ever been to in my life. It's amazing that his entire family lives there. There's waterskiing, jet skiing, and kayaking, and it's just really fun.
- I would say people remember me from 'Life Goes On' more than anything.
- My mom, who was a constant fixture at work with me until I was 18 years old, did an amazing job filtering out all the things a kid didn't need to see or hear on film sets. So, acting was just a fun, breezy, extracurricular activity for me.
- When I'm in New York, my favorite place on the planet is the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
- I go to museums all the time.
- My two goals are to read everything Edith Wharton has ever written and to have an art collection.
- My first kiss was onscreen. My character learned to drive before I did, so when they asked me to hit the mark with that giant Lincoln, I hit the camera instead. Being an actor gives an interesting perspective on life. And in my case, an interesting preview.
- I feel like the networks always end up doing similar stuff at the same time.
- I was in this sheltered little environment where, basically, all my high school experience was in 'Life Goes On,' and everyone told me where to go, what to do, how to think - I never had to do anything for myself.
- People feel like they know me, in a strange way, like they grew up with me or they went to high school with me!
- It's not imperative that I graduate in four years, and it's not imperative that I get all A's.
- I love doing television series.
- When I was a teenager, I worked on a show that was about a family.
- I'm not a movie star, but I've been an actress forever, and the first time I went on a date with my husband, he said to me, 'So I hear you're an actress. I've never seen anything you've done.' We were like, oh gosh, 21 when I met him, and I laughed, because I'd done 'Life Goes On,' and 'Christy,' and I mean, I'd been working forever.
