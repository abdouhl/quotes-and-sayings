- In order for a person of color to get on a cover of a magazine, they have to do something prolific - winning an Oscar, being the first billionaire, you know, or whatever. I think it's becoming more natural that somebody can get on the cover of a magazine just because they're an amazing person. That's what it should be.

- I'm an over-communicator a lot of the time.
