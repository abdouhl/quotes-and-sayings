- I know that Julia has been given to me for my spiritual growth, and this moment is perfect for us both. I know that I love her, and I know she's my soul mate.
- I knew what book we had to write, it was clear in my head; it was journals and poetry. So I passed on their offer. I told my agent this is our vision, and no one's done it this way.

- Relationships are so much a rerun of our parental relationships. We're rerunning the relationship they were in together and we're rerunning the relationship we had with them with our lover.
- This is the front edge of the spiritual, psychological movement and is where the tools of psychology have finally come together to create a mass healing. I think spiritual psychology is the next wave.
- We busted a lot of family secrets with this. But to make a long story short, my parents relationship was built heavily on security issues for my Mom, and when my Dad couldn't provide security, the relationship unraveled.
- I've worked so hard to eliminate the inner geek from my life. I suddenly realize I have no patience for those people who still have their geeks showing. Now I see why being 'normal' has been so important to me.
- That's an old saying I just made up.
- The more honest you can be, the less you have to hide... when I have nothing to hide, I have everything to give.

- You must have love as the core; it takes courage to be willing to constantly tell the truth to each other and risk letting the relationship go.
- I think Julia is defining a new feminism. It's the power of the open heart. And its ok to be sexual.
- I am attracting a new audience now, one that is more open and more spiritually inclined.
- Real freedom is creative, proactive, and will take me into new territories. I am not free if my freedom is predicated on reacting to my past.
- I am learning to forgive my inner geek, and even value him as a free man.
- I must let go of my need for the world to love me.
- I had to get in touch with the source, I had to go back into my abandonment issues with my mother, I had to go into issues with my father I hadn't even looked at before.
- Why not hold on to whatever I've got because it's as good as it's ever going to get. How can I believe that love is coming, how can I even believe that love exists; if I don't believe it's spiritually based?
- It's hard enough doing something bold without jumping into your bad reviews.

- I couldn't be in a relationship and behave like somebody else or pretend I felt something I didn't feel. And that includes saying things I thought might jeopardize the relationship.
- The corporate woman has been defined as the 'liberated woman' and I see that as the exact opposite. I think she now is more enslaved, maybe even more than the housewife was; because she's so out of her power, and imitating male power is not female power.
- When I see that my geek may have contained some of the best parts of me, when I love and appreciate him, I set my children free to see themselves as lovable however they are.
