- Every time we make a movie, 'Guardians' included, 'Black Panther' included, 'Infinity War' included, we just feel lucky to be making that movie, and that's basically what the focus is on.
- 'Captain America: First Avenger' is very much a Joe Johnston film.
- The best thing about being a film producer is I get to spend 99 per cent of my time behind the scenes.
- One thing that brings me great, great joy is reading the reviews of 'Civil War' and seeing the much deserved credit that Chris Evans is getting for his performance as Captain America.
- We try to keep audiences coming back in greater numbers by doing the unexpected and not simply following a pattern or a mold or a formula.
- In the case of 'Thor,' it was just casting the best people for the part. Ken Branagh had the idea to cast Idris Elba as Heimdall, and we didn't blink at that chance to do it.
- Kenneth Branagh has his stamp all over 'Thor.'
- Humor is the secret into the audience's other ranges of emotions.
- I'd argue that the term 'superhero' is much too broadly used.
- I'm always worried about overhype. I love underhype.
- Chris Evans has embodied Captain America as well as any actor has ever embodied an iconic pop-culture figure like that. I go back to Chris Reeve as Superman as the gold standard, and I think Evans is right there.
- What other people are adapting from the comics medium, I watch with as much interest as I do any other movies. Because I'm a fan, and I want to see what other people are doing in the world.
- From a financial perspective, you have to think about what the film will generate in revenue so you can set a budget against it.
- It's true that once a year I travel to Comic-Con... but there I can quickly lower the lights; I can show them the clips, introduce a few stars. And the spotlight is quickly off me.
- 'X-Men 1' - I did a cameo.
- We said, as we were developing 'Iron Man 1,' and working on these films, that our characters need to be as interesting out of their costumes as they are inside their costumes, fighting and flying around.
- Rejection is a common occurrence. Learning that early and often will help you build up the tolerance and resistance to keep going and keep trying.
- We always set out to just make a great movie.
- 'Guardians Of The Galaxy' was, as 'Ant-Man' was, just fun, in terms of expanding this universe. We always say, how can we keep audiences surprise at what an MCU film can be?
- I had admired the way the producers of the 'Harry Potter' franchise had found David Yates, who ended up doing their four final movies, and he'd come from television.
- 'Iron Man' and 'Iron Man 2' are as Jon Favreau films as you can see.
- I've always believed in expanding the definition of what a Marvel Studios movie could be.
- All of the Marvel characters have flaws to them; all of them have a deep humanity to them.
- I'm not sure that 'Iron Man' is a superhero movie. I think towards the end of the movie, Iron Man pretends to be a superhero - he's entertained by that notion. I think 'X-Men' is a sci-fi movie.
- You can drive yourself crazy and tie yourself in knots trying to anticipate what someone's going to like or not like, and doing test screenings and opinion polls. But pay too much mind to that, and you'll wind up with a big pile of mush.
- A very high bar has been set with Robert Downey in 'Iron Man.' That idea was, find the best actor for the part, regardless of whether they've been in a movie like this before.
- We want to see a Joss Whedon 'Batgirl' film be awesome.
