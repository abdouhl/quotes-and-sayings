- It would be really easy to write off the Dawn Wall as impossible. In terms of climbing technique, I'm learning a new language on this granite.
- When you're climbing with someone who always sees the bright spot, even if there is no bright spot, that attitude is really helpful.
- I don't want to be guy that almost climbed Dawn Wall.
- I climbed brick facades as a kid. You'd kind of stick your fingers in there.
- I like to control the risk I take. And when risk is taken out of my hands, it frustrates me.

- Climbing has a lot of themes that are applicable to people, no matter who you are.
