quotes = ['''Children do have the potential to kill art. But now I think they kill the bad art. At least that is what my son has done for me.''' ,'''I don't know if it's good or bad, but when I first started writing I imitated the narrative thrust of a movie. And as I worked, I learned what you can do in fiction that you can't do in movies, and vice-versa.''' ,'''I have a kind of unhealthy obsession with movies.''' ,'''I grew up not reading fiction; I watched movies and read comic books, and one of the ways I taught myself to think about narrative was through film.''' ,'''My parents were distrustful of the outside world.
