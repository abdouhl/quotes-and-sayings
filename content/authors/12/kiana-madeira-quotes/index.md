- Working with Olivia Scott Welch was such a dream.
- There's a certain feeling I get when I listen to something that vibrates in my soul.
- It's OK to just have one version of yourself. It's OK to have multiple versions of yourself too, but you don't have to.
- We were fortunate that most of the '1666' stuff we did shoot all together. We were filming out in Hampton, Georgia. It was so amazing. They built a village for us to shoot in. It made our job as actors so much easier.
- I think that social media influence is such a powerful presence in our society to the point where it's a little bit scary sometimes.
- We had to speak in a different dialect for '1666.' And when we were told that we would need to do that, I think that was the most daunting part of traveling back 300 years.
- Trinkets' is based on a book, so sometimes to take one book and spread the story out so much doesn't really do the story justice. Everyone just decided that two seasons would be the perfect amount of time.

- It's very rare that you get to play more than one character in the same world.
- One thing I can say about pursuing a career in the arts is, it is an adventure - a beautiful, intimidating, and fulfilling adventure.
- Fear Street' just takes all of those stereotypes and those tropes and flips them on its head. I feel honored to be a part of a community and a trilogy that does that.
- I realized being on the set that I love doing stunts and I love fighting and I love action, so it was really fun to shoot those scenes.
- Fear Street' subverts almost every stereotype that you can think of in the horror genre, which I love. We have a horror trilogy that's centered around a queer relationship. The main protagonist is a queer woman of color.

- Early on in my career, I struggled with body image and feeling comfortable in my skin.
- I feel like the scripts were so wonderfully written in the sense that my character in '1666' and my character in '1994' mirrored each other in a really nice way. They're both so strong, empowered, determined, and passionate.
- I can be the same Kiana that I am at home, on set, in interviews, everywhere that I go. And I think that it's such a relief when you accept that and acknowledge that about yourself.
- I would love to continue to tell stories that are constructive to our society; I would love to continue to portray characters that are people who have been oppressed in our world.
- One of my favorite albums that I've been listening to lately is 'Midnight Machines' by Lights.
- Moe's the first character that I played that actually allowed me to embrace all parts of myself, including my physical appearance, the things that make me angry, the things that I would consider quirks or little things that make me funny.
