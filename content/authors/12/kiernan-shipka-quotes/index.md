- Teens are being portrayed with depth because they are multidimensional, and they deserve to be portrayed as such.

- I'd definitely like to go to college some day.
- Chipotle never lets me down. I feel like, in the middle of nowhere, Chipotle is still there, and my burrito bowl is still going to sustain me. So Chipotle, for convenience and reliability.

- That's a big thing in my life: going with your gut. If something isn't lighting the fire and making you excited, or if something feels wrong or doesn't agree with you, it should be questioned. It should be talked about.
- Occasionally, as an actor, you're not... Sometimes, at least for me, I'm not fully in the groove until the second or third take, in which I would not want to just stop. If it's a scene that takes a lot of work and time, sometimes the scene gets better with time, and sometimes it gets exhausted. I think it just depends on the scene.
- I'm such a theater geek.
- I do listen to some music, but I don't technically have one band I'm absolutely hooked on.

- I can remember back to when I was 12, 13, and any show that I watched, I wanted to be the main character and embody them, and I think the fact that Sabrina is, in so many ways, such a positive role model for young girls is really cool.
- I have a Twitter, but I'm not a tweeter... if that really makes sense.
- Any day acting is an amazing day.
- I really had the best time on 'Mad Men.' It was a wonderful place for me, because I never went to an acting school or anything like that, so 'Mad Men' was kind of my training.
