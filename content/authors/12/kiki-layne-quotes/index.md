- It's amazing to me how quickly the industry will try to put you into a box. It's like, I did 'Beale Street.' And they decided now, all of a sudden, 'Oh, okay. KiKi Layne does those little quiet indie dramas.' I'm like, 'No! That's just where I got started.'
- I feel there's a really raw quality in the Chicago theater community that's really special.
- It's important to me that I'm more than a pretty face or another person starring in movies. That's great, but there's so much more than can and should be done.
- Most Sagittariuses start off really reserved. You gotta check people out, see what they're about, and then once we decide you're cool, then that's when we become super fun and really outgoing. But first we gotta make sure everybody's cool.
- I'm learning so much about my style just having access to so many things now. Growing up in Cincinnati, we really didn't have much money so it was really about places where you can go to get the most for the least.

- The history of black people in America, it's so painful. But throughout all that history there has still been the ability of our community to find love and laughter and joy even in these very painful circumstances. That's why I think in particular black love is so powerful, because it's constantly under attack.
- Will Smith is my favorite actor, because he has so much variety in his career. He's done all types of roles, played in all types of worlds, and to me, that's the fun of acting. That's why I started doing it when I was eight years old, because you get to be whatever you want.
- I just think the way Regina King carries herself in this industry is something to strive for. Even though she's been in the business as long as she has, she's still just one of the most genuine, realest people I've met so far. And so watching her, I realize that I don't have to change who I am at the core in order to have a career.
- I always have to find things that I relate to and understand in the characters that I play; otherwise, it won't feel that authentic.

- Fashion is another opportunity for me to break through boundaries and to be seen wearing things.
- I don't want to be put into a box.

- We're seeing more black women saying: 'This is who I am; this is what I've been given.' And it's beautiful.

- It's just always been in my heart to perform.
- It's not lost on me to have the ability to be wearing custom Dior or Gucci, with my box braids or my bantu knots. It's another opportunity to show that Black girls belong in these places and that what I naturally bring as a Black girl belongs as well.

- I was artsy.
- We all live in different worlds and situations, so what's the issue with representing that on screen?
- I'm very grateful to Barry Jenkins, who took a chance on me.
- I think a lot of times for women, especially in this industry, we're forced to do things for beauty that aren't good for what we already have.

- When you hear these stories about different cases of police brutality, don't even just make that person just another hashtag, another statistic. That is somebody's father, brother, sister, mother - be more aware of what that means.
- As much as I love to slay a red carpet hitting the ground running with 'Beale Street' and 'Native Son,' representing two such important voices in James Baldwin and Richard Wright let people know that I'm an artist and I really have something to say with this gift.
- All of us can relate to when something happens in your life and it just completely changes it. Now you have to figure out how you're going to move forward.
- When you're a Black actress, the box that we often get put in is so small. And me being a dark-skinned Black actress, the opportunities become so limited in a way that is just wrong. It's not fair. I'm so capable of playing a wide variety of roles. It comes down to whether or not I'm given the opportunity to do it.
- Acting is communication. It's giving and receiving.
- Instead of asking for permission, we're seeing more artists and creatives taking control over the stories we tell.

- I'm trying to be what I want to see more of: Black women onscreen.
- To me Kate Spade represents a woman who still has stuff to get done. She's like, 'yeah I'm stylish but I need to be comfortable and able to move.' I'm excited to be a part of a brand that's meaningful to women in that way.
- Watching 'Moonlight,' I just recognized this patience in the film - allowing moments to live and linger - and I just thought that was so beautiful.
- The thing about tarot - maybe this to me is the difference between it and working with a psychic - to me it's clarifying the things that you already know.

- I'm not going to ever feel bad about sharing what my dreams are.
- I'm very grateful that 'Beale Street' was that opportunity for me to be introduced to the industry in that way and have some doors open for me.
- My favorite artist is J. Cole. I like Kehlani a lot. Teyana Taylor is dope too.
- If you're good at your job, you're good at your job regardless of being male, female, whatever. Either you're a good director or you're not, and there are plenty of bad male directors.

- I started off with the flute and French horn, and then I was playing trumpet in the jazz band.

- I'm a huge fan of 'The Avengers,' but 'Black Panther' was so special to me.
- Like, no, I can really be queen of the universe. I can be president. I can be, I don't know, an alien from Venus. Like you could just seriously... and that's the fun of acting.

- I'm committed to jumping into roles, worlds, and stories that historically actors who look like me have been left out of.
- I've determined my style - I like to call it elegant funk. You'll see me in some really beautiful gowns but I'll still have my septum piercing in.
- My mom knew we were going to call me Kiki by birth. I think she had the nickname before she had my name, and she then found the name that would allow that.
- What does it mean when I wear something that makes me look like a Disney Princess? Versus something that's like 'ooh, maybe Kiki Layne can be a sex symbol.' Because these are things that, sometimes dark skin actors with natural hair, we don't get put into those types of conversations.
- I think I learned the value of being more patient with myself.
- I think especially when depicting young love, so often we see young love where you're just all about this other person, where you're willing to do everything, anything, wherever they need you to be.

- The Kate Spade woman is a classy sort of working woman who's still stylish.
- I will never forget my first Valentino Haute Couture show.
