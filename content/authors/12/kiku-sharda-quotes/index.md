- To me, every serial is equally important.
- I am not at all justifying Kapil's abusive behavior. I am only trying to say that when you know the person is depressed, you are still publishing negative stories about him and trying to break him. Why are you instigating him when you know his mental state? It looks as though people have an agenda.
- It used to be crazy as I would shoot till 5 A. M. for Kapil's show and then rush to the sets of 'Akbar Birbal' and then finish my dance practice.
- I didn't want to do character roles because when you are doing comic characters, you only get character roles.
- I really wish that 'Angrezi Medium' would have released a little earlier or little after - at least, we would have had a proper release. The movie was taken down after one day of release. It is such a beautiful film and Irrfan Khan hasn't done a film in a long time, given his health conditions.

- Psychologically it gets challenging at times to switch into a female character. But the moment I get into the look of Palak, I automatically get into the mood of her. My wife and parents have no problem with it. My wife has only told me not to enter the house in the Palak get-up after the shoot.

- I can't take so much of burden on my head, I am a happy-go-lucky guy, I don't take pressure.
- I barely get four hours of sleep everyday. I am shooting non-stop for 'CNWK' and 'Akbar-Birbal.' But it's all worth it when people smile at me at traffic signals in warm recognition. I couldn't have asked for more.

- What I like about films is that a story wraps up in three hours while on TV that is not the case.

- On a daily basis, I interact with lot of new people and new ideas come to my head.
- The apprehension whether people will like it or not also doesn't bother me much. I've always done my work with a gut feeling that this is what I would like to do and I've always enjoyed doing it.

- It was a fantastic journey on 'Jhalak.' I am passionate about dance and got to learn many new dance forms on the show.
- Kapil Sharma is one of the most creative persons that we have in our industry.

- I don't get to see my kids at home, so I invite them on the sets... time management has become a very big problem.
- I have been doing comedy for the last 15 years but I don't have any qualms admitting that I have learnt a lot from Kapil Sharma. I respect his talent and have not seen a performer like him in my career.
- I would love to make a film, because storytelling happens only in movies. I would explore relationships in my movies. Maybe, the journey of a child from a broken home, or a relationship between a single father and his kids.
- It was after sometime that I convinced myself that TV shows run on talent, not people, and then used my talent to the fullest.

- There are all kinds of films being made but I feel watching a film in a theatre is quite a family experience and when you can't do that, what's the point?
- I don't want to do anything where my day becomes boring.
- Oh, I really miss Grover yaar. Sunil and I have known each other for long even before we started working together on 'Comedy Nights With Kapil' or 'TKSS' and our bonding and chemistry reflected on-screen when we worked together. We have partied a lot together.
