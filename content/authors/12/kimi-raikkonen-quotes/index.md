- It was an easy choice to return with Lotus Renault GP as I have been impressed by the scope of the team's ambition.
- There's always a lot of talk about motivation to race, but nobody really knows what I do or what I think apart from myself, so I don't really care what people think.
- I'm delighted to be coming back to Formula 1 after a two-year break, and I'm grateful to Lotus Renault GP for offering me this opportunity.
- When I did some Nascar races this year I noticed that I was increasingly missing the racing side, to race against each other, because in rallying you really race against the clock.
- My time in the World Rally Championship has been a useful stage in my career, but I can't deny the fact that my hunger for F1 has recently become overwhelming.
- I just love the American spirit of racing. It feels just great to get involved with that.
- You always want to have a winning car, but there is no guarantee that it will be.
- When I was a kid, I would watch the grands prix. Everyone dreamt of becoming a race driver, while I only started thinking about it when I was 18 or 19. Only at that age did I seriously start thinking about this job. Before then, I would change ideas from one second to the next.
- Do you have any ambitions outside racing? My main ambition at the moment, whether inside or outside racing, is to become Formula 1 World Champion.
- In rallying every curve, every hill may be different than you thought. That makes it interesting.
- In F1 too many things overshadow the racing. There is too much politics.
- Since I started in motor racing I've worked with people from all over the world. We are all here to go racing and prejudice will never play any part in that.
- If I could throw my phone away, I would probably do it. It's always on silent, and I don't like when it rings and people are calling. We could live without those things in the past when we just had a phone on the street somewhere, on the corner or at the house. I have no interest in telling all the people what I do every day and where I am.
