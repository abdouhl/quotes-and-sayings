- When you're little, you're open to things. It's not like you get into this rehearsed zone when you're a child. At first you play different sides of yourself. And I think it will be really exciting one day to have a character to go into that's not anything like me whatsoever.

- I've been lucky to find people who want to work with me, whom I respect and like, but the truth is there aren't that many good projects out there. And we make way, way too many movies. So it's not always going to happen with every project. But I try and wait it out.

- I feel like everyone directs their own career according to their taste, what they migrate to emotionally and what kind of artists they want to work with.

- I think it's best to date someone who doesn't do what you do.
- The performances that I love are ones like Gena Rowlands in 'A Woman Under the Influence,' where women are allowed to be messy and imperfect. It's that kind of woman that has always inspired me to seek roles that are a little out of the box. I just haven't always had the opportunity to do them.

- I don't gossip about myself.
- When I was little, I put on plays for my family at Sunday dinner, and I would direct them and have all my cousins, my brother, and my best friends in it. I was a very imaginative and theatrical child and wasn't afraid of being in front of a camera. It was like make-believe to me.

- If you're successful at a young age, no matter the profession, there has to come a time when you reevaluate everything, what it means to you. 'Is this what I want to do for the rest of my life?'
- Most people ask me questions based on a previous interview. That's not an interview. It's like they're just saying my quotes back to me.

- In high school I had a boyfriend who was super into rap, so I was into Too $hort and Wu-Tang for a little while. And my best friend's older brother would sometimes drive us home in this pimped-out truck, and he'd play all his dirty rap music. We thought we were really cool.
- The filmmaker is really important to me: it could be their first film; it's not just about their reputation, but I have to really believe in them.

- You know that feeling when you wake up in the morning and you're excited for the day? That's one of my main goals in life.
- If I saw 'Virgin Suicides' or 'Eternal Sunshine,' I'm so proud to be in those movies. They are such great movies. I felt so free on those sets.
- Everyone goes through a hard time in their life.
- You don't really know who you're going to fall in love with at what time in their life. They can be the worst off they've ever been in their life, but you can't help who you fall in love with. That's part of the excitement of life - new people, new experiences.
- I don't really relate to myself as The Girl in the Magazine. Which is dangerous for me, too, sometimes, because I don't think all the time, 'Well, look to see if people are following me home.' Sometimes I'm a little bit more free than maybe I should be.
- I've never had a teenage rebellion; I'm not that type of person. I always work out my problems in a conscientious way.
- I'm very mature for my age, but I'm also innocent in a lot of ways.
- A lot of people my age, they grew up with me onscreen. I think that's helped keep a certain amount of longevity. When you grow up with a person, you feel like you know them.
- People always tell me, 'Don't work so much', but I can't help it. I feel like all the things I've done are important to get to this adult stage and now I'm getting all these adult offers, so it's working.
- It's such a private thing - 'my process' - I can just say that the work that I do is like therapy between me and the character.

- When I'm working, I always listen to music to zone everyone else out.

- Confidence is very sexy. You could be not cute at all and have such confidence.
- I was a big Guns N' Roses fan when I was seven. My friend who lived across the street had long dark curly hair and I had long blonde hair, so I'd dress up as Axl and she'd be Slash, and we'd rock out in front of the mirror singing 'Patience.'
- After 'Melancholia' and 'On the Road,' I wanted to do a comedy. And I did so many comedies when I was younger, but if you're not consistently in those movies, people don't always think of you for them.
- Pristine vulnerability is just so boring to me. The performances that I love are ones like Gena Rowland's in 'A Woman Under the Influence,' where women are allowed to be messy and imperfect. It's that kind of woman that has always inspired me to seek roles that are a little out of the box. I just haven't always had the opportunity to do them.
- I think every woman goes through a relationship where she is with a guy that is really not right for her. You get lost in it.
- I've always had a process that I do before I even get to set or go to the location. I work privately, and it almost feels like therapy between me and who I'm playing. So I have this inner life that's there and it gives me a confidence, too, that when I'm playing the role I know every question.

- I'm the kind of person who buys a new thing, wears it so much and then is totally sick of it.
- Why would I cry over a boy? I would never waste my tears on a boy. Why waste your tears on someone who makes you cry?

- I think you see in people's eyes what they've been through. Anything in their lives shows up in their eyes.
- I really want to do a film in another language. My dad's from Germany, so it'd be really cool to do a film in German. I'm not quite fluent, but I can get there. And my accent's pretty good. I wouldn't feel too out of my element.
- When you have a beanpole body, everything looks cute. Like Alexa Chung. I like her style, but she's really tall and skinny, so everything looks good on her.
- Doing 'All Good Things' really felt like I was acting for myself rather than anyone else. It gave me a freedom I'd never had before, or knew I had, to do whatever I want to, and to argue my opinions and not just feel like the cute girl on set or the girl in a boy's club. I figured out how I could be both. And it's been different ever since.
- Being an actress doesn't make you popular in school.
- I would always rather do a mediocre script with a great filmmaker than a great script with a mediocre filmmaker.
- I never read comics as a kid. I guess I was lazy and watched cartoons instead.
- You can never control who you fall in love with, even when you're in the most sad, confused time of your life. You don't fall in love with people because they're fun. It just happens.
- I'd like to be taller. I'd like my baby fat to leave.
- When you spend your entire life as a child actress, being told where to go and where to stand, you're performing constantly for people. It definitely breeds the kind of person who's dependent on other people's approval.
- I love to produce, and I've directed two short films.
- I try not to do scenes a certain way, because then I become conscious of it, and it dosen't come off as realistic. I try to make it so that I'm not really aware of what I'm doing.
