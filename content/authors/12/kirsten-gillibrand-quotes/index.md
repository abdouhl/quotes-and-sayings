quotes = ['''I find that when you open the door toward openness and transparency, a lot of people will follow you through.''' ,'''One of the primary reasons I first ran for Congress was to be a voice for our troops, veterans and military families.''' ,'''Nurses are on the front lines of our care. And they need to be at the foundation of health care reform. Let's get health care done - and done right - by ensuring the amount of nurses we need to provide quality care for all.''' ,'''Use your voice on the local level where it has the potential to be more widely heard.''' ,'''In addition to being an economic security issue, the failure to pay women a salary that's equal to men for equal work is also a women's health issue. The fact is that the salary women are paid directly impacts the type of health care services they are able to access for both themselves and their families.''' ,'''If we're going to be able to provide access to quality, affordable health care to every American - we need to have the trained health care professionals inside hospitals to provide that care.''' ,'''President Trump is tearing apart the moral fabric of this country.''' ,'''The brave men and women who have served - and those who continue to serve - our armed forces have selflessly sacrificed for our nation, and we owe it to them to provide the best services and protections available when they're overseas and after they return home.''' ,'''I believe transparency in government is key to restoring our nation's faith in its elected leaders.''' ,'''There is no greater call to service than that of our brave men and women who serve our country in combat across the globe.''' ,'''Doing right by our seniors isn't just about making the right decisions today - it's about ensuring that every generation of Americans can have a strong and secure future.''' ,'''We deserve a president who inspires us to stand for something greater than ourselves.''' ,'''Throughout my career I've fought for the rights of women as full and equal members of society.''' ,'''Our Declaration of Independence was the start of a conversation about how to achieve life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness for every citizen. Our Constitution was always intended to grow and adapt as we formed a more perfect union, established justice, and ensured peace, security, and the blessings of liberty.''' ,'''We can work with anybody. I mean, we passed the 9/11 health bill with Tom Cotton. Most people would assume I wouldn't be able to work with Tom Cotton and Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.''' ,'''A strong mentor can help a young woman find and advance in the career of her dreams that otherwise may have seemed impossible.''' ,'''The silver lining of the Trump presidency is it is an era of activism, and one where women really want to be heard.''' ,'''As a member of the Senate Aging Committee, I've gone to bat for seniors by cracking down on senior fraud, combating price gouging by pharmaceutical companies, and pushing for wealthy individuals to contribute their fair share to Social Security.''' ,'''I was one of the first senators to support marriage equality, and led the effort to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act.''' ,'''I didn't know how to pass a major piece of legislation; I didn't know how to get colleagues to support my views. It took a lot of asking for advice and learning. One of the lessons is that you have to be able to tell people why you care, and you're only going to be able to do that if you talk to someone whom an issue is affecting.''' ,'''As Congress focuses on comprehensive health care reform, one thing needs to be clear: We cannot fix health care if we do not address America's nursing shortage.''' ,'''Women in America must be trusted to make their own medical decisions and have access to the full range of reproductive health care, including abortion.''' ,'''Discriminatory wage practices undermine women's ability to provide for their families and survive on a decent retirement income.''' ,'''I'm proud to have stood with the LGBTQ community my entire career.''' ,'''For American families, Universal pre-K is an essential piece of the puzzle that not only allows their kids to get a good start, but it also allows mothers to remain on the job earning a paycheck and helping our economy grow.''' ,'''I love celebrating Mother's Day. Since I was a kid, it was a special day to tell my mother and grandmother how much I love them. Now that I'm a mom, it is a special day to spend with my children.''' ,'''The attack on the transgender troops - disgusting, disgraceful, outrageous. It's just endless. And then you try to do your day job of finding good bipartisan work across the aisle... You're doing both all the time. I guess I would describe it as intense. Everything is very intense.''' ,'''For me, getting off the sidelines means women making a difference by letting their voices be heard on the issues they care about.''' ,'''While we can't begin to repay the debt we owe our veterans for their brave service, we can certainly take steps to ease the physical, psychological and financial hardships they may be experiencing.''' ,'''When women earn more, families are stronger, and children have better access to quality health care and education.''' ,'''For many of the brave men and women who have fought on the front lines, returning home means trying to navigate a complicated and bureaucratic Veterans Administration benefits system.''' ,'''For too many, the shot for a brighter future is simply out of reach.''' ,'''By running, you're making that commitment that says, 'I'm dedicating myself to public service.' Win or lose, you're making that statement, and you actually are taking a step in that direction.''' ,'''I look at each nominee. If they suck, I vote against them. If they're worthy, I vote for them.''' ,'''America is the only high income nation without a paid family leave program. This means that if you or a family member gets sick, there is no guarantee that you can take the time you need to take care of yourself or your loved one, leaving already vulnerable families in the position of making hard decisions in cases of illness.''' ,'''As a candidate, Donald Trump said he would punish women for accessing abortion, and as president, he's made good on that promise by stacking the Supreme Court with anti-choice extremists Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch.''' ,'''Communities in every corner of America struggle to fill nursing vacancies to provide care for everyone who needs it.''' ,'''I have not been in Washington very long, but I've been there long enough to be shocked by how antiquated some of our laws have become.''' ,'''It's time to focus on real solutions that will create jobs and build our economy for real strength and stability - not just for the fortunate few, but for every American.''' ,'''The American people deserve to know that their elected leaders play by the exact same rules that they play by and that their lawmakers' only interest is what's best for the country, not their own financial gain.''' ,'''Just telling women: If you don't speak up, things aren't gonna change. If you don't become an advocate, it's not gonna change. If you don't vote, it's not gonna change. If you don't run, it's not gonna change.''' ,'''A bright future for the nation depends on the health and prosperity of rural America.''' ,'''When they return home from serving our country, our National Guard and Reserve members shouldn't have to be confronted with red tape in order to access the benefits they've earned fighting for our country.''' ,'''I was a tennis player in high school and college.''' ,'''I've never lived through a moment in history where people are using their voices and becoming strong advocates for what they believe in.''' ,'''As president, I will only nominate judges - including Supreme Court justices - who will commit to upholding Roe v.

Insurance companies do the same to block Medicare for All and prevent us from guaranteeing health care as a right, not a privilege.''' ,'''Americans are guaranteed the constitutional right to legal abortion in Roe v. Wade, and it's past time for Republicans to stop using the issue as a political football. In fact, it's past time for Republican politicians to stop interfering in women's personal lives, period.''' ,'''I was new at my job, and I needed to address my inexperience and weaknesses head-on.''' ,'''Instead of marginalizing women, Congress must get to work on policies that can foster job creation and fuel economic growth.''' ,'''LGBTQ people deserve to live, work, raise families, and succeed just like anyone else - and LGBTQ kids deserve to grow up in a country that supports and encourages them.''' ,'''I think the wall is stupid; it's a waste of the taxpayer's money. We need the money for job growth, infrastructure, 100 other things... it sends a bad message.''' ,'''I have always stood up to protect women's access to safe and legal abortion, birth control and health care at Planned Parenthood.''' ,'''The government can take smart steps to give all kids the healthy start they need to reach their full potential.''' ,'''To change Washington, you need to change the women's player list.''' ,'''Health care should be a right; it should never be a privilege.

We say, 'How can we pass this bill to help both of our constituents?'''' ,'''Brave doesn't spread hate or bully the vulnerable. Brave doesn't put greed and self-interest over millions of lives. Brave doesn't cower behind lies and walls. Brave doesn't pit people against one another. That's what fear does.''' ,'''We'd certainly have paid leave already by now, we'd have equal pay, we'd have a living minimum wage - a lot of things would change having that diversity of opinion in Washington. We certainly wouldn't be debating whether women should have access to birth control.''' ,'''Sexism is alive and well in politics, as it is in all industries.''' ,'''If we expect our children to thrive at our colleges and universities, and succeed in our economy once they graduate - first we must make quality, affordable early childhood education accessible to all.''' ,'''While we can never truly repay the debt we owe our heroes, the least we should do for our brave veterans is to ensure that the government takes a proactive approach to delivering the services and benefits they have earned, so they can access the care they need and so richly deserve.''' ,'''Put a lawn sign on your lawn; go door to door for your candidate. Register people to vote. There's so much we can do through our voices and time. That's what flips elections.''' ,'''In America, we make a promise to seniors: After a lifetime of working and contributing to this country, you'll earn the benefit of a secure retirement, good health care, and peace of mind in your later years. To me, that's a commitment we have to keep.''' ,'''A lot of members of Congress are isolated. They tend to be affluent. They tend to have a lot of people doing things for them.

There are so many important issues at risk. You're in a fighting stance every day.''' ,'''Along with a livable wage, many parents are desperate for quality affordable child care.''' ,'''I went to the Women's Campaign School at Yale; I went to Eleanor Roosevelt Legacy Training, women's campaign fund training. I got to know the district really well by talking to the county chair, getting to know politics, working on some local races.''' ,'''The men and women who lived through and came to our rescue on 9/11 were not Democrats or Republicans or Independents.

No. Just run for the office you want to run for and run on the issue you want to fix.''' ,'''We must do everything we can to help our service members and veterans transition into civilian life once they return home, and that means preparing them for the tough job market.''' ,]
