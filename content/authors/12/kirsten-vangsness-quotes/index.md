- From the time I was about 7 until I was about 13 or 14, I looked like I was Pat from 'Saturday Night Live.' I'm not exaggerating, remotely.
- I am always sort of delightedly surprised when someone recognizes me because as far as I'm concerned, I'm just going to work and getting paid to act, and that alone is fantastic; I forget people watch it, too.
- I dress a little strange. I dress a little theatrically.
- You would never argue about a straight girl playing a lesbian. Everybody still watched 'The L Word.' I feel like we have such great role models, like Jane Lynch and Jodie Foster and all these people that you don't even think about.
- I am a theater girl, and a lot of theater girls dress however pleases them. I wear whatever looks good on me. I wear what I wear because I have been shopping at thrift stores since I was five.
- I am a big believer in letting your own personal freak flag fly.
- 'Fiancee' is a very fun word to say, because I never thought I would have a fiancee or be a fiancee. Sometimes when I would introduce myself and say, 'This is my girlfriend Melanie,' it wasn't always clear what I meant. Now I get to say, 'This is my fiancee Melanie.'
- I didn't want that 15 minutes of fame moment like, 'Oh, she said she was gay.'
- I like writing about what to me are like questions that I have about myself and the human condition. I find quantum physics fascinating, so I like to write about that, and I like things that make me laugh.
- I like dressing how I like to dress, and I look like a little art statement.
- I dress like a 7-year-old space pilot. I have clothes that I still wear regularly from high school.
- On television, you have an intimate moment with the camera. In theater, you are making something live with people there. My brain doesn't understand that you don't get another take ever. I'm finally learning on TV that you can do something over if you make a mistake.
- I'm really proud of being part of that whole geek/chic, girl nerds, glasses are sexy and all of that because I think it's true. In America, I don't know about in other places, but there is this mythology about the way a woman is supposed to be and look and act and that's what makes them sexy. And I love being the alternative to that.
- I'm on the advisory board of Alex's Lemonade Stand, which is a children's cancer charity. I'm so proud to be on that and help them.
- I started writing because it was hard to find acting jobs. I didn't like any monologues in auditions, so I started to write my own things. Since then, I have written a couple of shows. I was nominated for playwright of the year for a play I wrote called 'Potential Space.'
