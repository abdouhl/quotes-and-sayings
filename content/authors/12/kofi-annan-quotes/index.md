What sort of Iraq do we wake up to after the bombing? What happens in the region? What impact could it have? These are questions leaders I have spoken to have posed.''' ,'''Eating insects is good for the environment and balanced diets.''' ,'''In the 21st century, I believe the mission of the United Nations will be defined by a new, more profound awareness of the sanctity and dignity of every human life, regardless of race or religion.''' ,'''Education is a human right with immense power to transform.

Where the leaders fail to lead, and people are really concerned about it, the people will take the lead and make the leaders follow.''' ,'''I think it is not just the U.N. speaking, but the concept of a third party, a third party to a conflict speaking out. You know, sometimes saying, 'Stop, this is enough. This cannot be allowed to happen,' gives the victims and the people who are caught in that situation courage, encouragement, support.''' ,'''The skills you need to fight the colonial power and the skills you need to gain independence are not necessarily the same you need to run a country.''' ,'''In the rush for justice it is important not to lose sight of principles the country holds dear.''' ,'''There is no development strategy more beneficial to society as a whole - women and men alike - than the one which involves women as central players.''' ,'''Shifting towards low-carbon energy systems can avert climate catastrophe while creating new opportunities for investment, growth, and employment.''' ,'''Sometimes leaders slide from the role of freedom fighter into the presidency, which they may be unsuited for, but everyone accepts it until they hit the bump in the road.''' ,'''My own advice to people who would be in office for two or three terms is that they must accept democratic rotation: ideally, not put themselves up for re-election and allow the system to work.''' ,'''We cannot allow situations where leaders threaten war on television or on Twitter.''' ,'''We need to think of the future and the planet we are going to leave to our children and their children.''' ,'''Change is a process which has to be managed.''' ,'''No single solution or actor can deal with the complex and interrelated challenges to electoral integrity arising from manipulated data, hate speech, and fake news.
