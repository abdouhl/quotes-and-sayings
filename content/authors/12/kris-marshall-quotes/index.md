- I'd spent the whole summer working in Manchester filming Citizen Khan and then went straight into the last couple of weeks of my wife's pregnancy.

- I really admire people who have the integrity and dignity to hold out for the best work, even if that means you're not going to work for six months. But I don't have that.
- I like to do everything, if I can. There's a lot of roles which I would have loved to have taken that went to other people.
- So even though 'Sanditon' was filmed in Gloucestershire on the coast, which was gorgeous, it meant I could finish work, get home, and do a few bedtime stories.

- You'll see a lot of actors doing adverts. There's a reason why. I could probably buy a castle if it were in somewhere like Lithuania. Not this country.

- In terms of diet, when I'm home, I start the day with a cup of coffee, Weetabix, toast and some fruit. If I'm at the house for lunch, I might choose an omelette with green salad.
