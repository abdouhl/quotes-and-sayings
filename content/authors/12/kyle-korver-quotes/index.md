- I like doing drills and when coaches take you through drills and stuff, but I don't like counting shots and things like that. I just shoot until I feel good.

- Draft night for me - I watched it in my dorm in college. And it started off with just me and a friend, because I knew I probably wasn't going to get picked right away.

- A lot of guys can shoot two, three, four, five, six, seven, 10 feet behind the 3-point line. A lot of people can do it. It's just, when is it going to be considered a good shot? When are coaches going to encourage you to shoot that shot?

If they do, and they want to keep talking about it, then I will.

- Most guys are either big talkers or big workers.
- The NBA is a beautiful job in a lot of ways. But for living stability, thinking you're going to be somewhere for a long time, it's not for that.

- When I came into the NBA, coaches wanted you to shoot a midrange shot or two before you shot your 3 - you know, to get an 'easy one' first.

- For me, I've never really thought of myself as labeled as a shooter or whatever. People can say whatever they want.
- It hasn't always been easy. There's a lot of hard moments. Sometimes you learn from the end of the bench. Sometimes you learn from injuries. Sometimes you learn the most through the hard things.

- That is what shooting is. There is no secret sauce, man. You've got to find mechanics that you can make the same every time, and you've got to do it over and over again, and you can't just shoot for rhythm. You've got to understand what you are doing. You have to focus on those details every day.
- I'm not a cold-weather guy.

- You can visualize, and you can try to trick yourself into thinking a certain way. There's all kinds of things you can do to try to get in the right spot mentally. But at the end of the day, to have real confidence, you've got to be doing good at your craft.
- I love thinking about mechanics and having your mind agree with the mechanics. Sometimes you can shoot it correctly, but your mind doesn't think that it's right. So it's like, how do you get your mind to trust that that's the right way to shoot it.

- I loved being 36.
- It's hard when you get down. You start pressing a little bit trying to get back in the game.

- Midseason trades are hard.
- A lot of things in life, you can be told the right way to do it, but you've kind of got to learn by your own mistakes. It's just human nature.
- Shooting is all about rhythm and confidence, and sometimes those are the last things that get there.
- It's good to always try to learn and try to grow.
- Moments can change games; moments can create a run.
- I think any of the older guys you can poll throughout the NBA, they're super-regimented. Because as long as that body lasts, your mind should be better; your shot should be better.

- The mental side of sports, it's huge. It's such a massive part of the game.
- I would say moving to Iowa turned out to be the best thing for my basketball career.
- I'll see some random guy and really like how he's locking his wrist when he's shooting or how a guy is catching the ball. It can be a little reminder that that's something I have to think about today.
- I probably need to hold my emotions in check a little more, but that's just part of my wiring, too.
- Sometimes it helps to take a couple days off, as weird as that sounds. Every once in a while, I could just shoot so many shots. You can get so, like, intense with it all. It's like in life, right? We're all created for a sabbath day or for a day of rest. You sometimes need that in shooting, too.
- I've played with a couple good shooters, but I've never been on a team where there's been three, four, five, six good shooters. And I've always thought that nothing gets you open more than being surrounded by good shooters.
- Not everyone gets to have one of the few super-dominant, all-pro, superstars in this league, and so playing with the pass and playing with space and playing quick is a really good backup.
- I've always believed the better the players I'm surrounded by, the better I am. I've never tried to think of myself as anything different. I know who I am as a basketball player and I'm never going to try to pretend that I'm more or less, but definitely not more.
- I feel like I'm a pretty good judge of character because I've had to judge a lot of characters.
- I've been on some really good teams.
- If there's a loose ball, dive on the floor. If you can take a charge, do that. The playoffs are all about scratching. Whatever it takes.
- If I see something in somebody, if it's something similar in my shot, I feel like it's the same type of thing in life. People who tell you what to do all the time or have all the answers for you, it's like, 'OK, whatever.' But if you've gone through something in life, you can speak to something a little more.
- I don't shoot shots just to shoot shots. I'm always working in a rhythm, working on mechanics. I've got a checklist of the things I need to do with my form, my legs, my arms, all of my mechanics.
- If the team is scoring, and I'm on the court, that's as good as me scoring.
- I have a hard time imagining a life without basketball.
- That's when I'm at my best: when I'm surrounded by good players.
- Every game is its own thing in the playoffs. When you're in them long enough, you understand. If a playoff series goes six or seven games, it's like a rollercoaster. Your emotions are so up, then they're so down. 'You can't do anything right! Then everything's going your way!'
- Chicago is an amazing place for sports.
- To have a superstar - he's Allen Iverson - he really took me under his wing and really forced me to shoot the ball and forced me to make plays, and to have him do that for me - and the way he was always in my ear telling me to shoot the ball and supporting me - it's a big deal.
- Every moment is big in the playoffs.
