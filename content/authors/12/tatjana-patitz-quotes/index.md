- Sometimes I get lonely, but it's nice to be alone.
- I would hate to be on a plane every day.
- I never starved myself.
- I want to do more documentaries and travel to places I haven't been. That is where I think I can be fulfilled.
- I loved making 'Rising Sun'. I got into the psychology of why she liked to get strangled and tied up in plastic bags. It has to do with low self-worth.
- I believe in aging gracefully.
- Microcurrent devices are actually really good because they stimulate the muscles, but I'm not a big fan of injectables. You don't know what they'll do to your face in the long run.
- Some models are naturally very thin, but if they aren't naturally like that, then what these girls do to their health to fit in... To be a size zero or a two when you're tall is incredible to me.
- It would be nice if models were allowed to be a more healthy weight - for the models, and for the young women who look up to them. We were athletic and healthy, and we looked like women.
