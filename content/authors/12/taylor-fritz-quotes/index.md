- It's a really good feeling in moving up the rankings so quickly because it's so reassuring that I made the right decision in turning pro.
- I think it's awesome that we're 50 years into the US Open being the US Open. It hasn't always been here. It's growing every year. Getting better every single year I come here.

- When I travel I have a full-time physio that I pay for myself. He also handles strength and conditioning.
- We had a court in our backyard, and I would mess around with the players on my dad's team. I hit with two hands on both sides, which I didn't stop doing until I was about 8.
- Tennis is such a physically demanding sport, and it can be so rough on the body at the pro level.

- I feel like I always win at least a round or two at every tournament. I don't go out in the first round too often.
- The first practice is two-and-a-half, three hours, and it's really physical. The second practice starts after lunch at 1 p.m. We work on specific stuff, like coming to the net. After that, I play sets. Then I'm in the gym for an hour-and-a-half doing legs, upper body, and cardio.
- My parents got me into tennis, and it's why I do what I do, and probably why I do it as well as I do it, because I've always had their guidance and their experience and their help throughout my whole life.
- I've said it lots of times before, I play for myself, so I'm not worried about other people's expectations.
- I always wanted to be a pro athlete. When I was younger I wanted to be the first person to be a pro at three different sports, but then realized how impossible that is. At 15 I stopped playing other sports and focused on tennis.
- Anything that would help me get my ranking up and get me seeded at tournaments will make my draws a lot easier and give me a much better opportunity to go deep in these tournaments.
- One of my strongest assets is my ability to be calm under pressure.

- It's always fun to play as part of a team and any other events that have that team aspect to it I always really enjoy.
