- I like breakfast sandwiches, and the Krystal Sunriser might be the best breakfast sandwich on Earth. It has a really soft bun and sausage, eggs, and cheese on it. It's great if you're out until 5 or 6 in the morning and you happen to catch the 5:30 first shift. That's what I used to do when I played clubs; I would almost stay out until they opened.
- I love New York. I'm working on Broadway, and it's a great way for me to get my feet wet in acting and a great way to season yourself as a performer.
- I was born on TV, meaning that's where I caught my break. So that's where I always have to be smart and revisit that medium as much as I can.
- I'm involved with Kid One Transport and Studio by the Tracks in Alabama. Kid One literally transports kids to better health by giving them transportation they may need to get medical care. Studio by the Tracks is an art outlet for mentally challenged children.

- Winning 'American Idol' gives the opportunity to really help make a change to a lot of lives, and making a difference has given me the greatest satisfaction and joy.
- Cooking is like music: you can tell when someone puts love into it. I come from a place where there was so much attention to detail. The population is smaller in the South, so more attention is given to serving smaller numbers of people.
- Life throws many curve balls, and if you don't swing... you're never going to hit any!
- I had to deal with being somewhat of an outcast because it's not socially acceptable to be a struggling musician. There have been times where I've felt sorry for the person I was dating. I felt she deserved better.
- The muses visit when I'm lonely.
- I'm not at the hoarder stage, but there are two or three storage units here and there. I have things that a lot of people put a lot of heart and soul into, a lot of mental energy. I'm good at keeping those things. When it comes to pop culture, as you move through this fast lane, you wonder where it all goes and how you can hold onto it.
- 'SVU' is one of my favorite shows. When I got the call to appear and play myself, I jumped at the chance. Obviously, I went over my lines, but playing yourself is a really great way to get your feet wet in the acting field. I enjoyed being on set and learning as much as I could about the scripted world.
- Y'all have no idea how many times I say, 'Yes, ma'am.'
- 'American Idol' is a juggernaut... Because of my 'American Idol' win, I am able to do the thing that I love most, which is to be an entertainer.
- I've been embracing gray hair since... high school, and I don't think that anything's changed since then.
- Any Southerner is spoiled when it comes to food.
- There were definitely curveballs in my growing up, from a family aspect. My parents got divorced when I was in second grade. I moved around a lot. Actually, I went to about four different schools when I was in fourth grade.
- Music was a big outlet for me. Being able to play an instrument and sing was definitely a good way for me to escape things I was dealing with: family issues, growing up, being a kid and not knowing what I wanted to do with my life.
- 'Idol' was groundbreaking television. I am very fortunate to have won the show at the time. 'Idol' changed my life, and I am thankful.
- I'm not afraid to eat breakfast at three in the morning. As a kid, I used to go to bed at 8 P.M., wake up at 1 A.M. when my grandma would cook me breakfast, and then I'd pass out again.
- Career had a lot to do with 80 percent of my breakups. It's very tough to date a struggling musician. The idea of it is enticing and fun and mysterious. But the reality is long hours and hard work. I have a lot of respect for the women I've dated.
- A lot of my music is very roots-oriented, and that's country and soul. I've been in every roadhouse in the South, soaking in all of that... Nashville is like a second home to me, and I'm just gravitating toward the songs.
- 'American Idol,' for me, is fizzling out. They can't package me, man... I'm an artist that's created this concept but used the 'American Idol' machine as a marketing tool.
- I've surfed the Web and the whole dating connection. I find that pretty fascinating, but no real leads.
- Some people get a kick out of Taylor Hicks being their landlord.
