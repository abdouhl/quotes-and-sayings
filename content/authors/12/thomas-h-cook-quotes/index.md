- Life to me is defined by uncertainty. Uncertainty is the state in which we live, and there is no way to outfox it.
- Risk will always be a part of life. It's how we recognize this and deal with it that matters.
- I went to the Alabama public schools at a time when my English teachers, all but one of whom was a woman, taught nothing but the classics. They revered the great British and American writers.
- I like characters who are changed, often for the better, by the dark nature of their experiences. I also can become engaged by a character for whom I wish to see justice done, one way or the other. In general, I require a book to have some sort of moral center.
