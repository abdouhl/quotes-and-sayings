- People wonder why I dislike my opponents. It's not personal or that I hate them: it's just that I know what I've had to sacrifice to face them.
- On May 29 2016, my wildest dreams came true. I became the WBC cruiserweight champion of the world at Goodison Park. The dream location, the dream title, the dream ending, a third-round knockout of Iunga Makabu.
- Boxing is the only thing I have ever understood - I certainly don't understand women.
- Anyone can lose a fight. That doesn't bother me. But the shame that comes afterwards is unbearable.
- People can dress it up however they want to, but boxing is life and death.
- I love looking back at the older fights; they don't make them like they used to. Just watching Tommy Hearns, the technique in his punching, the brilliance and the combinations from the likes of Ray Leonard and 'Sugar' Ray Robinson.
- I fear no man. I really don't.
- I just idolise Nigel Benn, the things he said, how ferocious he was, how intimidating he was - I just loved watching him. As I do the old Mike Tyson, the '89 Mike Tyson. The Tyson who walked to the ring with a white towel on and looked ferocious. He frightened me just watching him.
- I say some silly things now and again.
- I've made some bad mistakes in life.
- I just struggle with the fame thing and people thinking I'm something I'm not. I'll always struggle with that until the day I die, I think.
- I'm very lucky because less than one percent of boxers get out of the game financially secure.
- The Isaac Chilemba fight was draining.
- I will beat Andre Ward. I will knock out Andre Ward. He's a pound-for-pound king, but I will beat him.
- I knew about boxing, as my dad could fight. He had a successful security firm in Liverpool, and I'd see him come back from a jog before shadow boxing in the back yard. I'd watch and replicate what he was doing, as kids do. It's funny how things turn out.
- Normal athletes couldn't do what Premier League football players can do.
- I love 'Rambo.'
- When I left school - or, rather, when I was expelled from school for hitting a kid who had disrespected a teacher - I had nothing, with nowhere to go. Where I'm from, it really means that. Now my family are millionaires. I never dreamed this would be possible.
- I used to be a light-heavyweight, and I'm much faster than cruiserweight. That's the reason I didn't struggle with David Haye's speed, and David Haye is much quicker than Oleksandr Usyk with one punch and much, much, more destructive with the way he hits.
- I've mixed sparring partners up. I've done tons upon tons of rounds with big, heavy lumps who are trying to take my head off.
- As a heavyweight, I've not missed dieting. Those days where you're sore or tired, it makes me feel happy to know I can eat a bar of chocolate.
- Tyson Fury should be looked at as someone who conquered the world, defeating a nine-year king in Wladimir Klitschko.
- I had a headache for four days after the first Haye fight. I didn't tell anyone, I just went to bed and thought it would go. But for four days it remained. Then I got my brain scan before the second fight, and I was worried when I went for it.
- This World Boxing Super Series has been a breath of fresh air.
- I am not a heavy drinker, I've never taken a drug in my life, but I am prone to a pizza.
- I would never talking about hating a fighter. I don't hate no one.
- Usyk is less of a puncher than Lomachenko but comes with just as high a work rate, so Usyk has to take some to give some to be exciting, whereas Lomachenko has genuine power, and he can stop fighters with that power.
- I don't claim to be the best boxer in the world. What I claim to do is give 100% when I get in that ring.
- I'm after megafights, and me fighting Haye equals megafight.
- I love the sound of a Tyson Fury fight.
- Before I fought Adonis Stevenson in 2013, I had 4lbs to shift in a morning before weighing in. I had zero energy left to train, so the nutritional adviser said the only way was to drag it from my body in a hot bath full of salts.
- Getting into character to become 'Pretty' Ricky Conlan for the 'Creed' film was surreal.
- No matter what happens, I'll never be the greatest cruiserweight. That title belongs to Holyfield.
- My legacy is secure.
- Some say I'm arrogant, some say I'm deluded.
- Some people have asked me do you think I got David Haye at the right time, but nobody said it was the right time when he weighed in with a six-pack, looking fantastic.
- I'm from the street. We all know that.
- I love fighting. I don't know what it is in me, whether it's a sickness or a gene, but I just love standing in front of another fighter and going for it: they can hurt me, and I can hurt them.
- I am going to smash B.J. Flores to bits and be the first man stop him.

- I ain't a 16-fight novice who has only fought at British title level.
- Usyk could beat me - he's beaten better than me, so he could beat me - but I just don't think he will, and I will find a way.
- I've earned every single thing that I've got.
- I've never chosen the easy route to world titles or the easy route in fights, and I came up short against Stevenson.

- I've achieved all my dreams.
- I could also lose to lesser fighters than David Haye, based on the fact that styles make fights.
- My goal first and foremost when I walk into that boxing ring is to get home safe to my missus and three children, because they're all in life that need me, and they really do need me.
- I'm just a normal fellow who gets punched in the face for a living and gets punched really hard at times as well. But you know what? I'm all right at punching them back.
- When it's all said and done, Linares is an exceptional fighter.
- You will all laugh and say I wouldn't have a chance, but I would knock Andre Ward out - or I will outbox him. He is a pound-for-pound great, but I can match him on the inside, and he has never fought anyone who could do that.
- I can sell a fight, make no mistake.
- The speed and timing go with age.
- When I'm training, I don't think about anything else.

- I like the thought of gaining revenge over WBC light-heavyweight champion Adonis Stevenson, who beat me in 2013.
- Everyone knows I get off the floor, and I fight until the finish.
- Every single time I step into a ring, the same thing is on the line. Take away belts, take away money, take away glamour and fame. Ultimately, I'm fighting for one thing, and that's my life.
- I like hurting people.
- That's the thing with me: I'm never satisfied.
- What my family's been through I can't even put into words. We're very close.
- David Haye was a better fighter than me, but it's not about the better fighter because the better fighter does not always win.
- You don't brag about putting someone in hospital. It's absolutely horrible.
- Fighters like Bernard Hopkins can go on because their style is not based on reflexes and timing.
- Just because I beat David Haye doesn't make me a great fighter. I'm still the same fighter that I was.
- I defy anyone in the world to trade with me.
- I want people to remember me when I retire as a fighter who would fight anyone - that Tony Bellew was scared of no one. I'm happy with that. Anything more is a bonus.
- What people have to realise is that it's not the fights that are really hard; it is the training camps. It's living away from home for 12 weeks. It's sparring with guys who are told they will get Â£1,000 cash if they can drop me.
- People don't drop me with shots on the temple.
- I just tell the truth. Some people don't like it. Some people do.
- Stylistically, Tommy Hearns is much better than Marvin Hagler - his technique and punching were better - but he just couldn't do it. He couldn't beat Marvin Hagler, and it's because styles make fights.
- Make no mistake about it: nobody gives you nothing for nothing. You have to work hard to get what you want.

- I've always said boxing will not retire me, I will retire from boxing, and I stand by that statement.
- I just want to be left alone.
- As any fighter does, we all go down. Very few get up. I've done it on multiple occasions.
- Style makes fights; I've always said it.
- There will be no more fighting from me. The only things you will see me doing from here on in is trying to act sensible and behave myself.
- Do I beat a fully fledged, fully fit Tyson Fury? Probably not. But do I beat a Tyson Fury that's been out of the ring for two years? Yes.
- I'm happy for people to rate and rank me as they want, but it will never come from my mind.
- Especially with someone like me, my family know how much I push myself to the absolute limit.
- At age 68, I expect to be strapped to the couch with the remote control like Jim Royle.
- I was hoping David Haye would beat the fight out of me in the second fight.
- I've had a fantastic career.
- I can't and won't be defeated at Goodison Park, the greatest stadium in the world.
- I know what I am getting into with heavyweights. Not one of them can dictate against me because, firstly, they don't have feet fast enough. Secondly, while there are far better athletes and stronger fighters than me, even some who are quicker, they don't have the ring IQ I have. It allows me to dictate.
- In the build-up to a fight, I am scared, and I do worry about myself. But once I step into that arena, that worry has gone. A switch gets flicked, and I want to do damage. All I care about is doing damage as fast as possible.
- You'll never see me go into a fight and struggle to get up for it. I understand first and foremost what's at stake.
- When I go into a boxing ring, I'm willing to die.
- My dream is to fight at Goodison Park. Forget Wembley, or Vegas, I just want to fight at Goodison Park. It's been a dream ever since I was a child; no one's ever done it.

- I'm not a perfect person - far from it.
- I don't need celebrity friends. I don't need new friends. I am what I am.
- I am the best cruiserweight in the world.
