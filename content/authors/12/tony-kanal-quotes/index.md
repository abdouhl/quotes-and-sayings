- We had such a small budget making our first record, and the only way we could make it work was that the record company would find studio time in the middle of the night - literally, that was so cheap that we could afford to do it.
- It's not We're an awesome band.' The bottom line is, we're just very fortunate.
- Stick out the bad times because there's always good times coming up. When you come out on the other side, it's amazing.
- We kind of expected it - the lead singer always gets a lot of attention and a female always gets a lot of attention - but we didn't expect it to be as intense as it was.
- We came from that whole school of thinking that you give people 150 percent every time.
- We're getting older and we can't party like we used to.
- I think going through some of the hard times makes you appreciate it even more when things are going well. It makes you realise how fortunate you are and not to take things for granted.
- We're a vegan family, and my kids were brought up vegan, with a respect for all species, and we don't, as humans, have the right to exploit those species.
- I think Gwen, in her lyrics, always touches on personal subject matter.
- I don't see us as being part of that 90s revival. We were always a band, even when we weren't playing together.
- It's a different world now. You look out there and you can see so many people filming with their cameras nowadays. I can go on YouTube and see last night's show if I want to. It's out there.
- It's always a learning process, every time you work with someone. You take a bit of what their history is and hopefully you give a little back.
- When we started, we were in a van and looking for change under the seats so we could buy food. We went from that to having a hit and getting to do things like make music videos with million-dollar budgets.
- We've had those experiences as a band and you fast forward to just the crazy rock 'n' roll nights, where you'd try to outlast each other and see who could drink the most. Fast forward to now and it really is amazing and nice how family-friendly Vegas has become.
- I think we all realize that, if anyone left, it wouldn't be No Doubt.
- Just by default, because I don't have kids on my bus, I'm putting the studio on my bus. Where everybody else is doing their cribs on their bus, I'll have a little studio, so I'm going to invite my bandmates, on days off, to come and keep writing so we can continue the creative process and keep it going through the tour.
- For any band to stay together for 10 years proves that something is correct with the chemistry involved in all four of us.
- There was always a real camaraderie with No Doubt. It was always more than the music.
- We wrote the early idea for Undone' but it just wasn't working. Then Gwen had to go to England for some family stuff and when she was there, she sent me an email saying that she had an idea for what to do with Undone.' She sent me these demos and she was totally right, there was something there.
- We were on tour for 'Tragic Kingdom' for 28 months. We were going through the breakup, and in every interview we were talking about it so we were opening this wound on an hourly basis.
- I remember writing Sunday Morning' and Gwen wasn't feeling well that day and I had an acoustic guitar and I started singing, Somebody is feeling quite ill ' and that became Sunday Morning.'
- I never had a cool older brother or sister to turn me on to cool music.
- It's the little things that stick with you though. Like the boring airport layovers and the bus breaking down in Prague. Those were the real bonding moments.
- Just the fact that that song was 'Just a Girl,' people are going to focus on Gwen. They're going to focus on Gwen because she is the lead singer; because the first single that we released was 'Just a Girl,' and it is very autobiographical; and because she is who she is. And she is the kind of person that people like to focus on.
- I think if there's one thing that the history of No Doubt has afforded us, it's our opportunity to go and do different creative things, and I think we would be remiss not to explore different avenues.
- As pop songs, the early stuff like Electricity' and Enola Gay' were such inspirations to Gwen and I, especially melodically. They inspired us to try and do our own John Hughes prom-scene movie moment kind of songs.
- For us, the music is the most important thing that we're doing. But we also like to give that energy to the crowd, because what they do is take it and give it right back to you.
- We would write our songs, then we'd have a programmer come in and add, for lack of a better term, bloops and bleeps on top of everything. Of course, the funny thing is that a lot of the modern-day dance music people are super-influenced by the '70s and '80s stuff that we already love. So it was a natural fit for No Doubt.
- Adrian has golf, Tom has surfing, Gwen has Gavin, I guess, and this is all I have - I wake, eat and sleep No Doubt.
- You don't get that opportunity often to press the reset button, get in a studio, and just be free and creative. I think that's such a special thing to happen.
- As you get older, you're just smarter.
- The one thing I'll say about Dreamcar and the music we've created is that we never set out to do anything specific.
- Bad Brains are so underrated.
- On No Doubt's second visit to Paisley Park, sometime around 1999, we were working on a song with Prince called Waiting Room,' which would later be released on our Rock Steady album.
- There's something to be said for perseverance. We've been sticking it out a long time.
- I think back on it now and even though Gwen and I were living through a tough time with the breakup, as creative partners, that took precedence in our lives. Even though we were going through this really emotional stuff, which obviously ended out coming out in the music, we managed to stay really close and be creative partners through all of that.
- We would spend every morning drinking rum and Cokes or Red Stripes for breakfast, to get our heads in the right space. It's a wonder we got stuff done.
- I'm just always impressed with what Gwen pulls off. She's amazing.
- No Doubt is a very specific thing that's comprised of Tom and Adrian and myself and Gwen, and it will always be that way.
- So, I went to see No Doubt play on March 14, 1987 at the show at Fender's Ballroom in Long Beach, California. A week later I tried out and I joined the band and that was obviously a completely incredible thing for me and a life changing moment.
- We know how fickle the music industry is and that you have to focus on the things you can control-writing songs and playing music.
- We know how fickle the public and the music industry is.
- We would say, OK, the B section isn't good enough, let's rewrite that,' until we felt the song was great.
- Starting out, you're just doing it because you love it so much; that's what I remember about us. Looking back now, some of the things that seemed like big obstacles seem so small now - 'Wow, how will we get through this?' But we always did.
- There's a real family aspect to No Doubt. We all grew up together and we've experienced so much together.
- No Doubt will always be there; we've experienced things together that no one else will ever experience with us. It's a family that will always be there, and the music we've created will always be there.
- The 'Beacon Street' record was kind of like a b-side to 'Tragic Kingdom,' but it came out before 'Tragic Kingdom,' so it's a weird situation.
- I don't think anyone can relate to me as well as my band-mates can.
- We're from Anaheim, that's our stomping grounds, that's where we grew up. That's where we practiced in the garage, that's where we went to high school.
- If the audience is bringing it, it always goes up 10 notches.
- The interesting thing is that as soon as Gwen said, 'Let's go on the road,' we were all like, 'Let's go on the road!' Four adults turned into four giggly children.
- Gwen is someone that girls can look up to and feel like they know. She is very Everygirl.
- If your fans are comfortable, then people are going to be stoked to be there.
- We love Eighties music.
- Festivals have become so fan-friendly they make it so easy and comfortable for people and I think that's the most important thing.
- We travel with two personal trainers.
- Look, the Jamaican dancehall stuff, the reggae influences and the ska influence, are always going to be part of our DNA.
- We were having so much fun that once we were through each day, Tom, Gwen, and I would go, 'OK, let's go out and join all our friends at a dance club now.' And we would do this daily - go out and have a few drinks and dance the night away and at the end of the night go, 'OK, I'll see ya tomorrow at two o'clock, let's do it again.'
- One of the best things about being in a band for so long and having any level of success is the opportunity to go and play in different creative sandboxes.
- Songwriting is such an intimate thing, and with people you don't normally write with, you're naked.
- Just A Girl' was the first song that was on the radio for us. That was incredible because to hear that song on KROQ-FM in L.A., where we grew up, and you've listened to KROQ your whole life, and then to hear it on the radio was unbelievable.
- We've had lots of breaks, especially over the last 10 years, so to still be getting together and to be able to get on stage and play together is a big deal.
- I can tell when my brother's been borrowing my CDs.
- In our minds maybe we think we're younger than we actually are.
- It's honestly all about the audience and if they're having a good time.
- To be abundantly clear, No Doubt is four people, and that could never be recreated or replicated.
- Think about being onstage playing these songs. I'm opening my personal life up to all these people. But I just can't get attached. I've got to separate myself from the music and lyrics.
- You don't bring people down to your show and expect them to stand there and look at your shoes.
- This may be our 15 minutes of fame, so we're going to enjoy it while it lasts.
- We judge everything we do by the Clash and U2.
- It's an awesome feeling to have gone through all of the experiences we have together as a band and to now see our own kids there watching us.
- We've been through the experience of being in high school and starting a band. Then we were also a garage band, while we were going to college, trying to make ends meet.
- I always say this: I don't listen to stuff I've worked on when I'm driving in the car.
- One of the reasons this record took so long to come out is that we withstood a lot of pressures and we were unwilling to compromise on a lot of things. 'Tragic Kingdom' is a battleground. It was the outcome of three years of struggle.
- Using the computer to record was a cool way to keep all the original ideas intact.
- There's a different beauty to big and small audiences, and I don't think one is better.
- I'm not that familiar with bhangra or Bollywood music. Maybe it's just a reaction that kids have, that you don't really listen to stuff your parents listened to. I didn't think it was cool.
- It's always hard to talk about music and describe a song.
- We're not the kind of band that writes very well on the road.
- You can do a small club show and the energy is so contained. Then you play these big festivals, and have 50,000 people waving their hands in the air with you.
- We want to sound modern, but we're still influenced by ska, reggae and Eighties U.K. bands.
- You don't have to be singing songs about angst and pain to be credible.
- We were making 'Tragic Kingdom,' and we were kind of battling with the record company. It was just being drawn-out, in the same kind of situation where we were all working, we all had jobs, we were going to school.
- We never forget we're all in this together. But Gwen's an incredible performer and she deserves all the attention she gets.
- We've always found a muse for a record - something that's a unifying inspiration for the four of us.
- It's exciting because No Doubt has never played Rock in Rio before. It's actually an honor to be a part of such an iconic festival and the really cool thing is that the lineup is so diverse and it's got something for everyone.
- Sometimes in my mind I still think I'm 16 onstage and my body tells me that I'm not 16 anymore.
- The fact that our band has weathered so much and stayed together for so long and we still get on stage and have a good time together, that's a big deal for us. We don't take that for granted.
- For the first time ever we have our own buses. That's purely out of necessity because Gwen's got her nannies and the babies on her bus, and Tom has his wife and his nanny and baby, and Adrian his wife, nanny and their son.
- As far as scalping goes, I don't think you'll ever be able to eliminate it.
- What it boils down to is the vibe of the audience. If they're having a good time, we're having a good time. We feed off them.
- I knew we would eventually get back together, but I don't think any of us really knew when it was going to happen. It had to be a situation where all four of us felt like it was time. It's just too personal and too big, with too much history, to do any other way.
- We make hotels keep their gyms open late so we can work out.
- We've gone through just as much stuff as any band. We just don't choose to sing about it. Well, maybe we do choose to sing about it.
- We got to live though the record industry in its heyday.
- We were teens in the Eighties, and that's the kind of music that we all grew up on. When you're in those really formative years, from, like, 13 to 19, what you listen to is so influential, and I think that's just part of our being now.
- I'm not given the opportunity - nor do I want it - to write my own lyrics.
- We played one show in Bangalore in a field where they'd never had a rock show before and when we got there, they were actually cutting the grass with scissors.
- One of the most important things you need when you're doing big shows, like Rock in Rio, is consistency, and that starts with the sound in your ears. If it isn't just right, it throws you off and makes it hard to focus on the music and the performance.
- There's no way to escape who we are.
