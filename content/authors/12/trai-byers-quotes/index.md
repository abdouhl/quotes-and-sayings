- One thing I learned particularly at Yale was how to work with others. Having studied so long trying to master myself, the biggest challenge was learning about the other person's work.
- In 2013, I didn't work at all, just contemplating what I needed to do, whether I was walking in my destiny or not.
- Betrayal does so many different things to people.
- God is building an army all over the place, in Hollywood as well. So it feels good to be a part of it.
- We need to pay attention to each other. We are our brother's keepers. We are our sister's keepers.

- I do have musical background; I sing.
- Bipolar disorder is so swept under the rug as a nation and, I think especially, by black people. It's not our culture to go get therapy. 'Give them medicine for what?' We put people in court, put them in court again, versus really paying attention to what it is they are going through.
- I'm supposed to share the Lord with people. All of us are disciples on some level. You don't have to be behind the podium to tell a story, connect with people and share the Gospel.

- Ultimately, knowing God and reading the Word, it helps with patience with people, understanding, empathy and sympathy that they might not have that I have. If God gave it to me, why not exercise it?
- I'm an artist with a message, and my message is more for society, casting the mirror onto them and saying, 'Hey, this is what we look like, what are we going to do about it, how are we going to use what we've been through to aid where we're going.'
- When I think of Kansas, I think of family.
- There are many different forms of bipolar and the way that it expresses itself.
- I'm really passionate about God and religion, and I thought maybe I'm supposed to be a pastor.
