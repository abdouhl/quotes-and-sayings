- I take a lot of pride in growing my brand and connecting with young fans and with the reach that Lids has, with 1,200-plus locations and the amount of merchandise they sell gives me a large opportunity to reach out to fans and keep connecting and trying to grow the game of baseball.

- I don't want to be a player that signs a long-term deal and towards the end is resented, either by the fan base, by the organization, or on my end for having my performance slip below what my contract dictates.
- That's where my vision lies and my passion lies, leaving the game in a better place for my fellow players than it was when I came in.
- Spin rate itself doesn't make a pitch harder to hit. It just makes it further from what the hitters are used to seeing. It takes a pitch further away from average.
- I enjoy the pro game because it gives me an outlet to combine my intellect with something that I can still enjoy doing. It's better than applying my intellect while sitting in a corner office somewhere, trying to write code.

- I want to win a World Series. I've come in second, both in college and in the big leagues. I'm tired of it.
- I understand that the truth can upset people, but I'm never going to stop sticking up for myself, or for what I think is right.
- People get the wrong impression about me. They think I'm elitist or I'm conceited or whatever. But I'm a really good person. I take care of my friends and my family. I'm kindhearted. I'm a better person than a lot of people I'm surrounded by. I'll get chewed up for saying that, but it's true.
- Everybody is afraid of risk.
- More so than any other major American sport, baseball has the most diversity of culture and personality, and is the least marketable. Why? It doesn't make any sense.
- You always have to surround yourself with people that are more knowledgeable than you or are better at certain skill sets than you are, so they pull you up.
- I just get this reputation of being a bad teammate, but no one would come in and tell me why.

- I'm an intense competitor, and that fire is what drives me.
- I'm very much human.
- Growth and maturation isn't celebrated or isn't talked about in society now. Is it possible that I was a bad teammate in 2012? Sure. Is it also possible that I'm a good teammate in 2019? Sure.
- That's how I choose to approach my career. I'm constantly trying to find an edge and find the next way to improve myself.
- I want to make my fastball better. How do I high-grade my fastball to make it the best fastball in the league? I can only throw so hard. I'm close to my genetic ceiling on my velocity.
- Generally when I say stuff, people take it one way or the other.
- If I didn't play baseball, I probably wouldn't play a sport because i'm not really that athletic. Baseball was the one sport I could nerd my way to the top.

- I'm not explosive. I can't jump.
- The more those young fans get to understand that, 'Hey, this guy does some of the same things I do,' it creates a lot of interest and a lot of belief that they could become future big-leaguers.

- I want to be happy. I want to enjoy playing baseball.
- Look, I'm not that big.
- I've always enjoyed being on MLB Network Radio as a guest.
- You grow from failure. That's one thing I try to apply to my life in all aspects.
- Zito was my favorite pitcher for a good long time, pretty much until Lincecum came into the league. Obviously, if you know Barry Zito, you know the big curveball. So that was kind of my inspiration for learning how to throw it. Tried to pattern that pitch off of him as much as possible.
- I think at the end of the day, I am myself, to a fault.
- If anything, I hope to see more players feel comfortable speaking out and sharing their perspectives openly in the future. The game needs more of that in my opinion.

- I want to be a member of a winning team.

- Everyone makes mistakes in the past. I try to learn from them. I try to learn from them as quickly as I possibly can.

- I try to understand other people's viewpoints on things and be better in the future. I think if you look at my history as a baseball player, my history on social media and my history as a person, for those who know me well, they know that I apply that process to everything that I do.
- I am not tired of being baseball's designated 'outspoken guy.' It's just me being me.
- When the pressure is on, you're going to default back to how you've played your whole life and how you'd normally pitch.
- I grew up going to Dodger Stadium and I would look out there on the field with my dad and say, 'Man, those guys are superstars.' And they were. But they almost had this extraterrestrial feel to them, like it wasn't achievable. It wasn't a tangible goal because I didn't know anything about the players.

- I've had coaches along the way that actively go out of their way to make sure that I don't succeed. They don't like me.
- Spring training is kind of my offseason. I'm preparing for the season, but the workload that I experience in spring is much lower than any other time of year. And so, I enjoy it.

- From what I've read, Gen Z largely favors players over teams and that's one of the reasons it's so important to showcase MLB player personalities.
- I grew up in a loving family, but I essentially grew up alone. I had no friends for a while.
- I like who I am, trying to handle myself with integrity, character, honesty, treat people well and how I would like to be treated. And as long as I do those things, I can look at myself in the mirror and be proud of who I am at the end of each day.
- Hopefully at some point, someone else behind me will have an easier time with training methods, with being honest, with being true to who they are or whatever, because I broke down some sort of barrier.
- Why would you lock yourself in a situation that may not make you happy? I think that's highly inefficient.
- That's really one thing I really care about as a person is trying to make the people's lives around me better. Whether that's just being a friend and listening or with information I can offer. However it is, that's something I care about and I try to do on a regular basis.
- I ignore the vast majority of things people say to me online. Sometimes, I respond. But all you see is the response.
- I try to make the things that I say be based in reality, based in facts, and truthful. And if that's the case, and you want to be upset at me for stating the truth, that's your choice.
