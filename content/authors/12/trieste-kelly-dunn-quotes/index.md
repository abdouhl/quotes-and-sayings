- Some of my biggest complaints about acting in television were that I was always wearing a tight dress or pencil skirt, and I was always wearing heels.
- I love working with directors who have good taste. It's incredible when a director can say something and things open up for you. I went to The University of North Carolina School of the Arts, and some of my best experiences on sets have been working with other alums.
- I've learned that guns are exceptionally challenging to use effectively, with a power that must be respected. But mostly what I've learned is that they're a lot of fun, and dangerously appealing to an active imagination.
- Guns are heavy metal machines, and, at least in my case, it's surprising how many hours it takes before it looks like you know what you're doing. Releasing and re-loading magazines is difficult when you're asked to do it quickly and efficiently.
- While actors play with guns for make-believe, the guns themselves are by no means make-believe; they're real. Even when the actor is using blanks, there are all kinds of safety protocols to follow when shooting one at someone. Pulling the trigger is the easy part.
- Thank God for small movies and filmmakers who can make movies for not $8 million. Thank God for $8,000 movies.
- I definitely want to continue working in independent films - and big budget stuff as well - but there's a freedom you have when you're not getting paid. It's easier to say no and there's no pressure to please the powers that be. Also I don't have to hear 'flirt and smile more.'
- 'Banshee' was interesting because it was on cable, and it didn't have commercial breaks, so it read like a movie. Not only because of that, but it was a pretty interesting style, and I hadn't read a show like this.
- As a female, you are often being asked by directors to be warmer, softer, flirt more, smile more etc... None of those things are bad, and obviously we are capable of a variety of human behavior, but it gets really old having to play into somebody's stereotype or ideal.
- It helps with your acting when you're not in a perfect costume, perfect wardrobe, a perfectly seamed blouse, perfectly ironed hair, and perfectly done eyeshadow. It's really liberating.
- I think if a personal connection seems far off, I have to work and find a way to bring it closer to me, or I don't feel grounded.
- As an actor, some of the most fun days I've had on set have involved shooting blanks all day - or better yet, on a micro-budget indie shoot in Texas, shooting live ammo. I feel guilty admitting this, but make-believe beating a man half to death for nine hours can also be strangely satisfying and, dare I say, good fun.
