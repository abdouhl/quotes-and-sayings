- As a result, we will continue to see more innovation on the Internet and on mobile phones than on consoles.
- But any big change is more likely to result if there is a disruptive event such as new technologies or platforms that have a surprising effect on market share.
- From day one our next generation system will run all our exsisting software - so that gives us a head start.
- So the guy that we're really targeting our system at this year is one of the guys who brought a 16bit system three or four years ago and has pretty much had it with that, and he's ready to buy something new.
- Online console gaming will continue to grow at a healthy pace.
- And initially, a lot of companies avoid trying to make a really radical new kind of title for a new system, because that would involve learning a new machine and learning how to make the new title at the same time.
- We want to make as big a market as we can with our current product.
- But we also think that we've got more quite alot more support than any new format has ever had.
- There's a basic principle about consumer electronics: it gets more powerful all the time and it gets cheaper all the time. that's true of all types of consumer electronics.
- I'm not saying that more performance wouldn't be better - all these technologies are going to get better - that's the difference between first generation and second generation.

- We also had good software in the key categories and more focus on the gameplaying capability, so more of the marketing effort was targeted at game customers.
- I can't tell you how important it was for us to be successful in japan.
- We'll look at the japanese launch as a model and aspire to have things go as well as they did over there.
- None of our competitors have ever made two systems that run the same software.
- If you always wanted to wait for something better, you'd never buy anything, right?
- The only problem we've had is the amount of time it's taking people to develop titles.
- With our next generation hardware, polygon rendering will probably be an area we'll get more heavily into.
- What that means initially is that you have alot of products that are only slightly better games in the same genre on another machine - and the titles that really take advantage of the machine come along later.
