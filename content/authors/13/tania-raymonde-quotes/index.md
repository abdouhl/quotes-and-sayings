I grew up on that.''' ,'''I think 'The Walking Dead' is very interestingly paced. It's slow, almost like an old Western. It's also very stylised - visually, I think it's very pretty. It's more of a psychological drama than anything else.''' ,'''People ask me, 'Is 3D a good medium for horror movies?'

I am, like, the perfect horror movie viewer because I do not get scared very easily. I can really stomach anything so, as a result, I have watched a lot of really disgusting stuff that I should probably never have seen.''' ,'''I am a movie fan across the board, though, so if a movie is well done then I love it and it does not really matter what the genre is.''' ,'''I am like the perfect horror movie viewer because I do not get scared very easily.''' ,'''I would really like to do a straight action movie that's hardcore - heavy action, like 'The Expendables' or 'Fast Five.'''' ,]
