- I want variety. I certainly don't want any kind of hype if I can avoid it. I'm trying to play parts which are a little more out there, but I want variety, I suppose, because - like a lot of people - I'm easily bored.
- I loved DreamWorks and Pixar, and I still love kids' films.
- I didn't go to drama school to be a musical theatre performer. I enjoyed it, but I didn't go to do that; I went to be an actor.
- I've got Colin Firth's number in my phone!
- I'm a working actor. I don't make my own work, so it's the opportunities that are presented to me.
- That's the joy of making a movie: watching all the elements come together.
- I applied to drama school when I was about 18 and didn't have any luck anywhere. They basically turned me away and said I had a bit of growing up to do. I went back to Aberystwyth and did my growing up by spending eight months working in Peacocks.
- Of course, everyone would like to play a superhero, but this is by no means me saying I would like to go play Cyclops.
- I think being busy is a healthy thing.
- If there's one thing I've learnt, it's that I don't think a man ever looks better than when he's in a suit. So I'm wearing them increasingly, not in my personal life, but in my professional life, and I'm really enjoying it.
- I had dreams of winning Olivier Awards.
- We don't quite have the same comic book culture as America, but I would watch Spider-Man cartoons and X-Men cartoons and watch Bond as much as anyone on the planet.
- In school, I always sang in choirs. In fact, I used to do a lot of musicals in the youth theatre that I was a member of between the ages of 16 and 18.
- I want to play real characters rather than young leads in very plotty things. I want variety.
- I completely get the drag thing.
- Franchises mean that you're tied in. That's a lovely feeling of comfort to the whole thing. From a business perspective, it really keeps you current and lets you go and do other smaller, more pedestrian things.
- I've had two fights in my life. Both times I threw one punch, and both times I broke my hand! I really am a stranger to the world of fighting.
- Doing the press has become as much of a job as getting in front of the camera. You have to avoid burnout, avoid saying anything stupid, but still come across as yourself.
- People always say 'humbling,' but I actually think it's quite inflating being nominated for an award. It's wonderful; it's a great feeling.
- If something appeals, something appeals. I don't think I'm particularly calculated about it. I know I have an alarm bell that goes off in my head where something feels like it has no creative integrity to it at all, and it's just about making money.
- I like dogs, I just don't choose to spend time with them.
- If I could play any superhero... my favorite superhero is Spider-Man. Andrew Garfield is wonderful at doing it to the point that I don't think I should play it.
- I feel like I've made good friends with people I've worked with, but in terms of lasting inspiration, it is probably Matthew Vaughn who directed 'Kingsman' who's been really supportive, loyal to me, and been a really good person to work with.
- I used to sculpt a bit as a kid.
- I want to surprise people and do different things and maybe do something that's not quite financially rewarding.
- I don't want to start getting my little violin out, but travelling across the world constantly and staying in hotels is tough, man.
- In drama school, I entered a singing competition, which I ended up winning, which was great.
- I'm into books - I love literature, so I toyed with the idea of being an English teacher. I had a fantastic English teacher at school. I think great English teachers make the world go round.
- I always sang in school choirs and went on tours to other countries. I have always loved it. It's a very communal thing, and you really connect with people.
- For my money, when you're doing an on-camera performance, unless it's for something particularly stylised, you are, by and large, striving for naturalism.
- If you watch a television show made by accomplished professionals of children's TV, it's all very expressive.
- I'm very conscious of... I don't feel like a star.

- I've made these films, and I'm really proud, but my lifestyle hasn't changed.
- I can say I'm not doing 'X-Men.' I love the franchise, and I love the people who make them on and off screen.
- The endless teen franchises that come out of Hollywood... more often than not, the central character doesn't have any discernible character traits. They're just the young, good-looking guy who goes on this journey. They're always played by fantastic young actors, but ultimately, they're not very interesting characters.
- There are some parts of my life that are wonderful, and it's amazing to get to go to cool events and award shows and things like that, but I think the outside perception is that your life just changes overnight and you wear Dolce and Gabanna suits and drive a Mercedes. But life's just not like that.
- The Strokes are one of my favorite bands... And there's this band called Future Islands that I love.

- It's quite a thrill to be playing a hero.

- I love funk and soul and Motown.
- Part of me looks forward to a time when I have a family and a partner and I take less of my nourishment from social occasions. Having a little unit around me will make my working life easier, because it is quite lonely otherwise.
- For an actor to have the chance to go and play something that's far away from yourself, physically and also in terms of personality, character, is so much fun.

- The whole spirit of 'Eddie The Eagle' is that it's the taking part that counts, not the winning.

- I have absolutely no interest in playing the young male lead around which a story happens.

- Brie Larson's performance in 'Room' was pretty incredible.
- You go to drama school, and the people you revere and admire are those who work on the London stage, and you hope that's a world that you'll be able to break into and do enough occasional television and small film work to eventually get to the point where you're paying the bills.
- I'm not interested in going and doing a big, action-adventure romp with nothing to say about being a human being.
