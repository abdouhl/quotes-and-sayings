- The majority of my work is about preparation.
- I'm interested in the murky areas where there are no clear answers - or sometimes multiple answers. It's here that I try to imagine patterns or codes to make sense of the unknowns that keep us up at night. I'm also interested in the invisible space between people in communication; the space guided by translation and misinterpretation.
- My work is drawn to the political but avoids an agenda. There is no inherent critique or support.
- In my work, I construct texts and images. Between those two points the blur occurs. Each is altered by the other again and again, back and forth.
- I do seem to try to make things harder and harder for myself. In some perverse way, obstacles interest me and I'm drawn to projects that end up being incredibly laborious.
