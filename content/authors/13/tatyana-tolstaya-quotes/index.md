quotes = ['''I am interested in the subject which is Russia.''' ,'''Politics disappears; it vanishes. What remains constant is human life. So I try to develop a perspective in my writing where politics is just one of the pieces of furniture in this furnished world. It is not the purpose. It is not the goal.''' ,'''Art has nothing to do with politics. It is the freest thing in the world.''' ,'''People know that I am a very good author.
