- I love Sunday-morning drives. I'll be up at 6 A.M., get a cup of coffee, and head out.
- I think I'd be a good dad; it would be a pleasure.
- To me, the most romantic gesture is a quiet night with my girl. I like to cook for her. I'm a meat eater and a griller - I do steaks, I do chicken, I do fish. I have a broad palate!
- I own nothing; I just stay with friends all over the country.
- I enjoy my food. I like to grill; I do that a lot. I like meat and have big dinners - steak, red meat splurges, prime cuts.
- I once lived in a cottage made entirely of wood, and there was an electrical fire. We all ran outside, and no one got hurt, but the house was demolished.
- To be honest, as an actor, job security is not a trait.
- As an actor, some of my favorite things to work on are night exterior scenes. Any time that we're on location and shooting at night, it's just magic. I got to do that so many times working on 'Vampire Diaries' that it filled my hat.
- I'm a country boy. I grew up kicking around the woods, riding dirt bikes, playing football, climbing rocks and all that good stuff, so that's always been fun.
- I don't think anybody thinks they're bad, just in life, in general.
- I have a bunch of brothers. I grew up with a big family.
- My mum wants me to get married - and have children, of course. She's met Gaga; we've been dating a while. We're in a committed relationship, and I'm really happy in my relationship. I'm a very lucky guy. As far as having more of a domestic life and settling down into my relationship, we have to see what happens.
- I'm not very materialistic - I don't have a whole lot of stuff. But I do always like a pair of really weird socks.
- I am a gypsy. I havent' had a home for a long time. Call me a homeless person - I just throw everything in a bag and I'm good to go.
- I don't have lavish taste.
- When I was on 'Trauma,' the first order was six, which turned to 12, and then there were rumors of getting cancelled. I'm used to that.
- I look up to a strong woman; maybe that's why I fell for Gaga. She works incredibly hard and is very strong and inspirational like Mom, with a great work ethic.
- I was in San Francisco for 'Trauma' and then got back to town and got situated and started looking at things and passing on things. I think I was around for a month and a half, and there were other projects that were up, but it's all a waiting game. And then, 'The Vampire Diaries' came up, and I was really interested and read for it.
- I want a brood, you know. I'd like to have a little soccer team and a minivan and all that stuff.
- If 'Chicago Fire' goes for a long run, maybe I'll look for a place, but in my line of work, you can't throw your eggs into one basket because you might have to move. I'm not big on 'things,' though, so I don't own TVs, couches or cars because I wouldn't know where to put them.
- Being on 'The Vampire Diaries' feels almost like a game you play when you're a kid. When I was a kid, I used to have to take the garbage out at night on Wednesdays. I lived out in the country. I'd take the garbage out, and I used to pretend that I was the only person in the whole world, except for one other person, and he was looking for me.
