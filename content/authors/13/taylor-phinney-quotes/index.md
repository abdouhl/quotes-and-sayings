- I'm not super social, don't really go to parties, or basketball games, or football games very often, the big social occasions.
- When I'm not training day in and day out I love to go out and dance, even though it is potentially in my contract that I'm not allowed to do that.
- I would describe my dancing talents as incredibly deep.
- It's cool to be in the paper every once in awhile and people read about you and they know who you are.
- I raced locally for a year, went to Europe the year after and went to the Olympics the year after that.
- There's a lot out there for me to learn that isn't in college, so I think it's fine for me if I don't go yet.
