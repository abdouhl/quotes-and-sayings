- To live abroad you have to grow up quickly.
- Celtic are a great, traditional club.
- A lot of my family follow Liverpool, including my dad Tero and my uncle. In Finland I would say Liverpool is the biggest team, it started in the 1980s with the games on the TV. And then obviously they have had two Finland legends in Jari Litmanen and Sami Hyypia.
- The Scottish game is not easy - far from it.You don't have so much time on the ball. There are aggressive defenders but it is good. Every opponent likes to mark closely so it is not so easy to score. In Germany there was more space to run into other areas of the pitch.
- Of course, I can't be like Gary Hooper or anyone else because I'm me.
- Football is getting bigger but ice hockey is still the biggest sport back home.
- I'm not the type who gets stressed about something.
- If I see someone that's too arrogant, that's not how I was raised.
- I haven't made any targets of how many goals I want to score, because I just want to help the team.
- Daniel Farke is so good, a man-manager - he is calm but he can shout if he thinks I'm not working.
- Growing up in Finland, ice hockey was the main sport. But I never played that. I went with footy. I never had any other hobbies.
- I got the call, 'Celtic want you.' And I knew Celtic were a top, top team. I thought it would be much easier than it was. It was quicker than I thought. When you got the ball, there was always a defender at you.
- Physically I was not strong enough to play at Celtic and I know myself it was not my best time as a football player, for sure.
- I wanted to go somewhere I could be more part of the team and where the coach really trusts me. At Schalke it wasn't really like that.
- When I played in Germany there was also a good atmosphere in the games but this is better at Celtic.
- My favourite team was always Barcelona. When I was young, I went to see them, my first ever big game. Jari Litmanen was playing there at the time. In Finland, Litmanen is a big hero for all of us.
- Scottish football doesn't suit me perfectly, how I want to play football.
- It is hard when you think you can do better, but things just aren't working out.
- I got used to the physical play in Scotland and it taught me about some stuff for sure.
- It's not easy to be a footballer.
- I will always keep my feet on the ground.
- Klaas-Jan Huntelaar is one of the best goalscorers in the world and even watching him in training and in games you can learn from him.
- I played in Germany which is quite a physical league.
- Those years in Denmark changed my game and how I played football.
- I just live life and I do not think about what will happen.
- Even if you have a contract you can be sold.
- It was not so easy for me in Scotland in general.
- I didn't really adapt to Scottish football well, but I enjoyed my time there. The physical nature and the pace of the game was a big thing, and many of the teams defended really deep against Celtic so there was not so much space to run in behind. That's a big part of my game, so that was one thing as well.
- I always try not to read anything of people talking about me, but of course you can still feel pressure at the stadium, during the games, if you don't play well.
- If I walked down a street back home people would recognise me, but they wouldn't approach me.
- You never know what's going to happen in football.
- Since I was a young boy, it was about playing football, always as a striker, never another position.
- When I moved to Schalke it took me a few months to settle.
- I have great memories of playing in the Champions League at Celtic Park. That was something I will never forget, and of course we won a championship and that's something no-one can take away from me.
- A lot of Finnish people are laid-back and quiet and that's how I am. I've never seen any reason to change myself.
- When I do defensive work well it always helps my offensive game.
- If I have a bad game I go home and see my daughter and I don't think about the bad game anymore.
- Both of my parents sacrificed a lot. My dad, Tero, would drive me to training every single day. My mum, Teija, came to Seville to help me. She did everything for me. It was such a big place to go at 17. Even if you can speak English, it doesn't matter there. It was all Spanish. They don't do English.
- Neil Lennon was a great manager; he really got your team in the mood and wanting to play for him.
- I like it in Denmark. The league is very good and all the teams are of a similar standard.
- It is always nice to get your first goal of the season.
- When I was a little boy, my dream was to play in Spanish football, which I've done, and then it was the Premier League, so it's all worked out OK.
- As a young guy I was really shy, more shy than I am now.
- It took me some time to get used to the game in Scotland because it was very different. The game is quicker and more physical. You don't get much time on the ball, that's for sure. It is probably better than I thought as well.
- I had four seasons with Brondby in Denmark and they were crucial, mentally. The first two seasons there, I score nine goals, then nine goals. Then we get a new coach, Alexander Zorniger. A German guy. The next two seasons, I score 20 then 17.
