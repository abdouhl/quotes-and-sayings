What makes me feel strong is knowing that I can live my life and be who I want to be.''' ,'''Love is, to me, a lot of different things. It's the love you have for yourself and if you have a family and friends. Your love for pizza.

I had no idea people could be as mean as they are when you're an adult.''' ,'''Don't get me started on PETA.''' ,'''Just because we're plus size, doesn't mean we have to prove that we're healthy, just as someone who is smaller than us or average size doesn't have to prove they are healthy.''' ,'''The societal obsession with appearance is definitely something that weighs on your mind as a model.''' ,'''People laugh in my face sometimes if they don't know who I am. When they find out that I model they're like, 'well what do you model?'''' ,'''I've noticed that a lot of people who criticize me are from the U.K. - both in the press and on social media. Since I've been here, I've gotten a lot of stares on the street, but in the States, people always come up to me and say, 'I love your hair' or 'I love your dress, you're so cute.'

If you want to run 5 miles up a hill, cool, go run. Do whatever you want to do, but don't let the size of your body and other people's opinions about you stop you from living the life you deserve.''' ,'''Obviously I probably have internalized fatphobia about myself and what the world has ingrained in us.''' ,'''Plus-size is a term that's never been used in hate; no one has ever used it in a negative way. The industry has always used it to help us identify where to shop.''' ,'''It's really hard to find boots for plus-size women because most of us have larger calves - not all of us, but most of us - so it's hard to find boots.''' ,'''I'll wear a crop top if I'm not loving my stomach because it kind of forces me to pay attention to it and to love it, really.''' ,'''For so long advertising hasn't been inclusive when it comes to plus sizes which is crazy to me.''' ,'''I have no friends from high school.

I am fat, so it's kind of silly to get mad about it.''' ,'''I think that people think that since I literally wrote the book on how to love yourself that I love myself all the time, but I don't.''' ,'''At the end of the day, we all have issues with our bodies.''' ,'''I can never celebrate a success in my career without it being picked apart because of my size or 'my health.'''' ,]
