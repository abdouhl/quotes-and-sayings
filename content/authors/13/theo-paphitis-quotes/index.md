- It's very difficult for an entrepreneur to let go. It's very hard to sell a successful business. People sometimes hold on until the business has no value at all.

- If someone underestimates you because you are warm and approachable, then you have an advantage over them.
- In the 1960s, my first-generation immigrant parents were gifted the olive branch of a blue British passport when working for the British Army in Cyprus. It completely transformed the Paphitis story.

It's so close to the way I grew up.

- I'm not massively academic. I'm a commonsense person.
- The statistics for investing in small businesses are such that the vast majority fail.
- Every successful high street needs a catalyst that starts making people want to come there, and independent shops can be that catalyst. If you want a new idea on the high street, you'll probably find it in an independent. I know I shouldn't say this, but new ideas rarely happen in chains. What we do is adopt it once we spot it in an independent.
- I like the odd day relaxing by the pool, but I couldn't stand to sunbathe for an entire week.
