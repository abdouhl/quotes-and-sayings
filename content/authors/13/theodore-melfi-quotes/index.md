- To me, there are saints every day. They stand up and help others and live for others and do things for others.
- After a tumultuous 20-year marriage, my father up and left one day, leaving my mother to raise three boys without the means to do so. And yet somehow she did.

- I have a very strict philosophy that if you're not working out, you're getting fat.
- If you don't infuse humor into a subject matter, no matter how dark, the audience can't accept the message of a film. It closes them down. Humor can open them up.
