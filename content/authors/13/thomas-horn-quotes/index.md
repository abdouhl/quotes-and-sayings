- I'm not sure I have a natural gift. I think it's just that some people have an easier time expressing their emotions, maybe because of the way they've been raised, and I've always been expressive.
- I'm kind of a private person in a way.
- I would go into a place that was quiet and isolated and think about how my character would feel in the situation, considering who he was and what he had been through. I would think about that even up to 30 minutes. And when I felt the character was in my body and I had left, I could walk onto set or into rehearsal.
- Grief, no matter where it comes from, can only be resolved by connecting to other people.
- Mature? Yeah, I get told that a lot. I don't know if it's true. I guess I try to be bright.
- I had a really great experience so far with film acting. And most experiences from most actors, I've heard, are not like this. But I want a career that has many disciplines and many options.
- People have recognized me sometimes but not much. I'm glad my life isn't too different. I don't want it to be.
- We were bemused, I guess, when we got the call from Hollywood. We didn't know anything about the entertainment industry or even what a casting agency was. But I thought, 'What do I have to lose?' It's not every day a great opportunity presents itself.
- I don't want to make any huge decisions before I really know what I'm doing and am sure of myself.
