On closer scrutiny, it turns out that many of today's problems are a result of yesterday's solutions.''' ,'''The people made worse off by slavery were those who were enslaved.

Put differently, the terrible fate of their ancestors benefitted them.''' ,'''Hyperinflation can take virtually your entire life's savings, without the government having to bother raising the official tax rate at all.''' ,'''Groups that rose from poverty to prosperity seldom did so by having their own racial or ethnic leaders to follow.''' ,'''Freedom has cost too much blood and agony to be relinquished at the cheap price of rhetoric.''' ,'''The most fundamental fact about the ideas of the political left is that they do not work.

When you go down that road, don't expect freedom to survive very long.''' ,'''Facts are not liberals' strong suit. Rhetoric is.''' ,'''The Congressional Budget Office has been embarrassed repeatedly by making projections based on the assumption that tax revenues and tax rates move in the same direction.''' ,'''It is hard to read a newspaper or watch a television newscast without encountering someone who has come up with a new 'solution' to society's 'problems.'''' ,'''Creating whole departments of ethnic, gender, and other 'studies' was part of the price of academic peace.

Only if you cherry-pick the data.''' ,'''Imagine a political system so radical as to promise to move more of the poorest 20% of the population into the richest 20% than remain in the poorest bracket within the decade? You don't need to imagine it. It's called the United States of America.''' ,'''Being willing to donate the taxpayers' money is not the same as being willing to put your own money where your mouth is.''' ,'''The old adage about giving a man a fish versus teaching him how to fish has been updated by a reader: Give a man a fish and he will ask for tartar sauce and French fries!
