- I just don't like getting scared, like when people hide and jump out of places. That totally freaks me out. I'm not a fan of it.
- 'Hatching Pete' was so much fun. Mitchel Musso and Jason Dolley, as well as Josie Loren, who was also in '17 Again' with Sterling and Zac Efron and Matthew Perry are in it. We just had a blast filming.
- Our days are numbered, and God is just waiting for you to come back to him.
- I trained in Texas at Nikki Pederson Talent Academy.
- I don't think once you book a part you should stop going to class. I think you should constantly remind yourself that you're working and that you're working on getting better.
- You're never going to get from the industry what you give to it. But it's worth it; you just have to be realistic.
- No one is perfect in this world, and we all have our battles, but it's the way we get back on our feet and turn it around that really counts.
- You just have to be comfortable in your own skin before you jump into something where people that you're going against are going to be better than you in some way every time.
