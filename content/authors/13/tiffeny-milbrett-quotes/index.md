- I can't pretend to be enjoying this. I can't pretend I'm enjoying going out there and playing this style.
- I am somebody who... - I'm not saying I'm perfect, but I need that freedom, that ability to make mistakes out there. Because there's a fine line between making a mistake or being brilliant.
- I've known since I went to the national team when I was very young that I was a different bird.
- I don't think the game should be perfect. It's 95 percent mistakes out there - you have to work with 10 players on your side and another 11 against you. It's a crazy, chaotic game.
- But that in and of itself this past year was not a factor in what I did for the national team every time I stepped out there, or in training, or when I stepped out there in the WUSA.
- You can't ask every player to do the same thing. That's why we have amazing midfielders, defenders, forwards and keepers. You can't ask them to be of the same mold.
- It's not like you make a decision and everything inside you is 100 percent happy.
- I think it's sad to me that I had to make a decision to not play the game that I feel like I'm best at and that I love. But if it was just about the game itself, I'd be there in a heartbeat. But that's not how the real world works.
- I want to be the goal scorer and the play maker out there. I have been doing that all my life.
- I couldn't change who I am; I couldn't change the kind of player I am.
- Soccer's not a game that you can restrict players, especially creative players and players who have proven themselves at that level.
- Coaches give you too much information. I've been allowed to develop that intuitive ability in my career and lifetime.
- I'm not saying I didn't have ample time to recover, ample time to get to my best, I felt this year I did fine. When I stepped on the field for the national team, I was ready and able to make an impact, to score goals, to create chances.
- To be the key player in creating and scoring goals, that's what I take pride in, and the thing I know how to do best.
- My philosophy about the game, for instance, is that you have players out there who really do different things.
