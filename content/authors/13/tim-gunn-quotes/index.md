- I learned early on in teaching how easy it is to hurt a young person and that's never my intention.
- There's nothing I like better than going to my apartment, closing the door, cooking my little dinner for one and just tuning out. My apartment really is my haven. It's a nest where I go to heal.

- But if fashion were easy, wouldn't everybody look great?
- I had this wonderful career and thought I would retire as a teacher.

- Men's wear is all about tailoring.
- But I will add, there's one thing I will not do, ever: I will never talk to you about things you cannot change. It plants a negativity in the head of a designer or the student, and it's a distraction.

- I love HGTV. I love the Food Network.
