- We're journalists, so our default position is we're not writing editorial. We're trying to bring information to readers, viewers, so that they can make up their own conclusions.
- It's an amazing thing to hear they're finally giving out a Medal of Honor to a soldier from the wars of Iraq and Afghanistan.
- As journalists, because you don't carry a gun, you sort of become this observer.
- I'm a documentary image maker, still and moving, because keeping the real world on the agenda is really important at a time when we're increasingly disconnected from parts of the world on whom we depend.
- You can construct whatever story you want to. Documentaries are constructions, as is all journalism.
- Brotherhood means laying down your life for somebody, really willing to sacrifice yourself for somebody else.
- I don't go to war for the adrenaline rush. I cover wars because that's what I've ended up doing.
- I think it's really important that we understand that we share this world and we're connected to it.
- With soldiers, their wives are so fundamental in their relationships, and yet there's this kind of other war happening back in the States, where wives of soldiers don't quite understand what their husbands have been through, because their husbands won't really talk about it, and that's really the hidden war.

- Going to Liberia really changed a lot for me. I didn't realize what was happening on the same planet. My understanding that in the world everything is interconnected really grew - to go to one of the poorest countries from one of the richest countries in the world. It was two worlds apart.
