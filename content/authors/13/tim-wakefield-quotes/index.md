So I try not to use my pre-game warm ups as a barometer of how I'm going to pitch.''' ,'''I'm honored. Really honored that the Red Sox have asked me to possible be on the board of the Red Sox Foundation and do some stuff on their charitable works that they are so passionate about.''' ,'''It's nice to have a catcher who knows my mechanics, too.
