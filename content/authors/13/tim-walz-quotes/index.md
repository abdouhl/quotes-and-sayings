quotes = ['''To jump-start our economy, we must leave cash in your hands - because if you've got money in your pocket, you'll spend it at the hardware store or the corner market, and that will drive job growth in our private sector.''' ,'''We don't need more of the same, typical politicians fighting for themselves and for special interests. We need someone to believe in our small-business owners again and someone to champion those folks who play by the rules.''' ,'''I feel like I've got feet firmly in different camps. Between the right of gun ownership and public safety.''' ,'''You have to understand what caused genocide to happen. Or it will happen again.''' ,'''My first mission is to take care of our troops. I take that mission very personally.''' ,'''The budgets we work on in Congress are more than just fiscal documents; they are a reflection of our moral values as well. In choosing where to spend money, members of Congress choose what priorities they value.''' ,'''If giving tax breaks to millionaires created jobs or grew our economy, I would be in favor of them, but they are the same failed policies of the past that just don't work.''' ,'''Our nation is defined by an unshakable belief that we, the people, have the ability to control our destiny. A belief that anyone can reach out and grab opportunity and create a more prosperous future for themselves, their children and their grandchildren.''' ,]
