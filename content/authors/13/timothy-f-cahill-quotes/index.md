- I take compliments and I take constructive criticism. Not everyone loves you. It's the way you react as a footballer. I use it all to make me play better.
- India should go at their own pace and not compete with anyone. They have a league system in place and a huge fan base, but the thing they need the most is a good structure. They need to create a good footprint for football in the future because they have the numbers, but they need to improve the quality of the game.
- I want to work with kids and help develop them, show them the right way, the right morals and attitude into how to become a better footballer. Australia has many different cultures but I'd like to bring in the indigenous style, bring their competitiveness, athleticism and raw ability into the frame.
- Millwall is where I learnt my trade, and it was the most important learning period of my life - my apprenticeship in understanding football.
- I remember cleaning boots at Millwall on Â£250 a week and feeling like a millionaire. I'd made it then. At that time, if I never played for another club it wouldn't have bothered me too much because I'd made it with a football team in England.

- I have a lot of friends in the Australian cricket team, and they have told me a lot about India. Brett Lee was telling me about the food and Bollywood. I am the kind of person who likes to embrace the culture of a place, and I really want to travel and see the various temples around the country.
- For me, I don't talk about numbers. I've had big contracts my whole career; I just don't like talking about numbers if they're real or not real... whatever offers I've had, I always keep it private.
- I want to help grow the game in India and encourage young kids to play football.

- Every time I score the passion comes out and I try to relay that back to the fans and to the players and the staff how grateful I am to be playing for such a good football club. The fans have taken well to me. I am part of the furniture at Everton, but I don't take it for granted.
- The appetite and fight for winning a game outweighs any other thoughts.
- Whether you're a mechanic or you build houses or you work in an office, you don't have to like your boss.
- Playing away is just as exciting as playing at home.
- You could take everything off me tomorrow, I'll still be happy. So long as my family are living very close together, that's all that matters, really, for me.
- I love cricket. My all-time favourite is Sachin Tendulkar, without a shadow of a doubt.
- I'm blessed that I'm not content. Whenever I work with kids, which I'm passionate about, I want them to know that, yes, two World Cups, two Asian Cups, but I've done it the hard way.
- I hold the record now with Dixie Dean for being the only Everton player to score three Merseyside derby goals at Anfield. I still hope to better it. Things like that, the fans never forget.
- It's a massive compliment to me to be known in Asia because Asia is the way forward in football, along with the Middle East. I believe that strongly.
- It's pretty cliched, but Times Square is just incredible. You really feel like you're in the capital of the world.
- The tattoos are about my grandmother dying, and they tell the story about my mother and father, my brothers and my sister, my kids. It's pretty much a family tree on my arm with my life in football, too.
- As long as I am able to compete physically with the younger players, I am going to play.
- I'm a very traditional person. The tattoos are about my grandmother dying and they tell the story about my mother and father, my brothers and my sister, my kids. It's pretty much a family tree on my arm with my life in football too.
- They knew who I was in Australia in 2006, but not to a great extent. Now, with the momentum of a second World Cup, it has gone crazy.

- I am someone that appreciates talent.
- No money in this world could convince me to play for Liverpool. That's not a lack of respect for Liverpool supporters or the football club. It's respect for the Everton supporters. You just can't do that. It goes against everything that I stand for. No chance.
- All I do is play football, eat, sleep, play with my kids, play football.
- I've had it all my life - people thinking I was too small or not fast enough, not strong enough.
- If kids see you on the street and they want an autograph, that's a big honour so I spend half an hour before I get in the ground and 40 minutes to an hour after the game with the Everton fans signing autographs.
