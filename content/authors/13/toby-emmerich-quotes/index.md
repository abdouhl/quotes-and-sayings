- 'The Conjuring' is incredibly effective and scary without the use of blood, gore, and death. It's a horror film that emphasizes atmosphere and suspense in the tradition of classics like 'Psycho' or 'The Others.'
- I want to make films that people will say, 'That movie rocked!'
- To be honest, prestige is probably the last thing I focus on.
- We never had a giant library or owned a lot of commercial characters the way most studios did. And since we didn't have a lot of internal resources, we had to find ways to be inventive and resourceful, which I think is a healthy way to run a good business.
- We made too many expensive movies trying to offset the loss of the 'LOTR' income. There was a lot of pressure to re-create that franchise, which turned out to be unhealthy for us, because it's such a once-in-a-lifetime success. It would be like trying to re-create 'Avatar' over and over again.
- I don't think any of us are careful enough about emails. When you are writing an email, you should imagine yourself in an auditorium speaking to 5,000 people, with your mother and grandmother in the audience, and it is being broadcast on CNN.
- If there's a secret to New Line, it's the people here.
- I don't squabble a lot, but everyone has a bad day.
- There are so many entertainment options - Netflix, Amazon, Hulu - and especially for younger people, who are Internet-savvy and video game fans.
- I guess you'd have to say that sometimes the audience is smarter than the critics.
- I've been to New Zealand, like, 25 or 30 times.
- When I'm channel surfing, and 'Silence of the Lambs' comes on, I have trouble turning it off. I wouldn't say that about 'Beautiful Mind.' It's a good movie, but I'm much more in awe of what Jonathan Demme did with 'Silence of the Lambs.'
- A movie needs to have a must-see quality among the people you are targeting. Also, make movies at a responsible budget so that if you attract your core audience, and they show up in the first few weekends, the economics will work.
- The villain in superhero movies is often, I think, what makes the movie.
- It feels to me like 'Shazam' will have a tone unto itself. It's a DC comic, but it's not a Justice League character, and it's not a Marvel comic. The tone and the feeling of the movie will be different from the other range of comic book movies.
