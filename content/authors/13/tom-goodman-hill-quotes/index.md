quotes = ['''You have to make decisions - you know what you think. That doesn't mean the audience are aware of your decisions or what you think - the lines you're saying may have ambiguity.''' ,'''You've got to take what comes. You've got to make yourself available for everything; you've got to pray that you're in a position to do the jobs when they come around.''' ,'''You can get a bit 'head in the clouds' - well, I do - and full of myself if I stick in front of the camera for too long.

I have no idea. I'm not a ghost person... it doesn't mean there aren't unexplained things; I just don't think they're ghosts.''' ,'''I love doing research.''' ,'''I remember when I was about 12, I read M. R. James' 'Ghost Stories Of An Antiquary' under the covers, way too young to fully understand what was going on with those stories - completely terrified but absolutely loved them.''' ,'''I love ghost stories but kind of left them alone after my teens and came back to it after playing Heathcliff in 'Wuthering Heights' on the radio.''' ,]
