Their ability - anybody's ability - to predict what human behavior is going to be, without looking at the entire construct, is difficult.''' ,'''Evolving societal values indicate that the death penalty should be abolished in its entirety.''' ,'''Society is now less convinced of the absolute accuracy of the criminal justice system.''' ,'''I have spent 40 years both as a doctor and public servant putting people first.''' ,'''Age is the thing that correlates best to what health coverage costs.''' ,''''Competent counsel' ought to require more than a human being with a law license and a pulse.''' ,'''All of my political career, I've fought for the taxpayers.''' ,'''I'm very tough on crimes where there are victims who have been physically harmed.

If you're making $40,000, $50,000, $60,000 out there and you've got an Obamacare plan, by and large you've got an insurance card, but you don't have any care because you can't afford the deductible.''' ,'''There are going to be counties across this country that won't have any insurance company providing coverage.''' ,'''I have no feelings for the criminal. All my feelings lie with the victim.''' ,'''I am convinced that, because the criminal justice system is run by humans, it is naturally subject to human error. There is no rational basis to believe that this same type of human error will not infect capital murder trials.''' ,'''You get the choice as individuals across this land to be able to purchase the kind of coverage that's right for you and your family.''' ,'''I say that Medicaid isn't the only vehicle to be able to purchase coverage or be able to have coverage.''' ,'''I liked the give-and-take of a policy discussion in the community, with citizens. I didn't know that even took place, frankly, but I never dreamed it would be an enjoyable thing to do.''' ,'''I have no idea what stocks I held in the '90s, in the 2000s, or even now.''' ,'''Somebody's going to pay for health coverage for the American people, and the question is, how do you do that?''' ,'''Anybody that's asked, I've counseled that they not expand Medicaid eligibility. I've been critical of any expansion because you know what Washington does. It promises something for a finite period of time, and then it leaves you on the hook.''' ,]
