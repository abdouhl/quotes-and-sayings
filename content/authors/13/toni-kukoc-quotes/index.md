- When the confidence builds it is easier for the player to come into the next game.
- It was almost an accident that I got into basketball at all but fortunately it wasn't too late and I was able to be a part of a great generation for the sport.
- I don't think the people in Chicago really knew exactly who I was in the seven years I was there.
- Sometimes in my mind I have a picture of something happening, and because the foot is not right it is harder to happen. I see the ball and I can see myself intercepting it or rebounding or doing this stuff, and it's just not there. There's not the movement or explosiveness.
- I always felt like I needed to play basketball.
- For nine years, I was playing at more or less the same weight and I'm a little bit slower than I used to be. But I'm glad I have a couple of pounds more because I think it will help me in games for sure.
- I have got to stay aggressive. When I have a shot, I have to take that shot.
- I thought those three years when we won championships, I really was good enough to play in the All-Star game. I felt I deserved to be in the top whatever that would be, the top 20-some players in the league. Really felt that comfortable and confident on the basketball court.
- Maybe NBA teams won't want me and maybe I'll play in Europe the last one or two seasons.
- Coming here, I never thought about being like what I was supposed to be in Europe, the No. 1 guy and building the whole team around you. Coming here, I was relaxed about that because I knew there was going to be Michael, Scottie, Horace and I could learn from them.
- It's a saying if coach likes and sees good stuff in you and wants you to play he'll pick on you, he'll make you work and do things right. Once he stops talking to you, you know you're done.
- War very strange thing. Not easy, not easy for sure to leave family, friends, even car, house, everything.

- I always felt comfortable looking at the court.
- You never know when people with sick minds can destroy your life. It doesn't matter how well life is going on for you that moment. If that can't happen in the middle of New York City, it can happen anywhere else. If the terrorists can hit the Pentagon or the White House I don't see where it's safe.
- In Italy, my wife and I always said we feel like strangers because there's maybe only a couple other people from other parts of the world. Here in Chicago, there's millions of people from Poland, thousands from Japan, hundreds from Croatia. We like it here.
- When I first started playing, we practiced nine hours a day. Five and a half to six hours of those were working on the fundamentals.
- I don't want to say which guard it was with the Bulls, but I would take the ball and he would come to me and say, 'You are taking my bread.' I didn't know the slang.
- A lot has to be the NBA. I don't know if I can say it is the egos of the players or the money that goes around and everything. But those relationships between the coaches and the players are just not the same. They are not even close to the European coach-player relationships.
- I try to imagine what it will be like to play for the Bulls. I don't think I will be able to feel it before I step on the court at Chicago Stadium.
- I think it's very important for every player after a long season, whether it's good or bad, to get total rest. Not just physically and mentally from basketball and the pressure on the court, but the pressures outside, too. Then, when you come back, everything's exciting again.
- My biggest reason for coming is to prove to myself that I can play in the NBA.

- I'm a sportsman, not a political man.
- When you see me laughing on the court, it means I'm having fun and enjoying the game.
- I was one of the main guys on my team and you always want to check people that you're bringing in. Are they tough enough physically and mentally? Can they respond when you need them to respond?

- When you reach triple-double, you know you were involved in every part of the game.

- Kevin Durant, to me in my personal opinion, is the best player in the NBA.
- Michael may be the biggest player in the N.B.A., but he's not the N.B.A.

- I am not a prima donna. It's just that I feel cold on the bench.

- I would watch San Antonio play and see plays I recognized from the Russian team, the Yugoslavian team.
- I can pass the ball pretty well.
- At least I can say no player got as much attention from the Dream Team as I did.
- I'm disappointed anytime I don't play well.
- Michael will always, to me, be the best player ever. He changed the game. He made it global. Every player today should tip their hat to him.
- If people say my numbers aren't enough for the Hall of Fame, I'm fine with that.

- It is nice to start a game and feel the game from the beginning, but I have to pick up the pace when I come off the bench.
- My choice was either Chicago or Milwaukee. Milwaukee is going with a young team and Chicago is in need of a big guy, so that's it.
- I had to change my game completely. I was what Scottie was. What he was doing here I was doing in Europe.
- I'm not a political man. I'm a basketball player. So that's what I have to do first. But second, I will try to help my country because I am a Croatian.

- I have always felt that I have to play with the ball to be the best player I can.
- I didn't play the No. 4 spot much at all in Europe.
- My wife doesn't want to go. She says, 'I am your wife, I will do as a wife should.' But she is worried about what she will do in Chicago, all by herself.
- Only Vlade Divac go first year he play. The rest of the guys from Europe sit on the bench.
- The ultimate sports figure. The ultimate competitor. Great person. I consider him my friend. I wouldn't be that good if I was Michael Jordan.
- Obviously the game is more enjoyable when the ball is shared and everybody looks for each other on both ends of the floor.
- I worry for the future of the world. For my children.
- Scottie was just a different character than Michael. He was more the soft side. Every once in a while he would explode, but he would help me. Michael on the other end was almost always aggressive.

- It was always a dream to come to the NBA.
- Everything about me is Croatian.
- Like everybody coming from Europe, I didn't believe it at first, but you really need time to adjust. I thought it was going to be like going from Croatia to Italy. But you really need the time just to understand things here.
- My thought is the only way I will have progress is in the NBA.
- There were games I would score five and games I would score 30, and sometimes the five points were way more important than the 30.
- Those two months I didn't play didn't help me. But injuries are a part of basketball.
- I would say it was my fault, my choice to not allow people to know who I was. Places I went, people I knew, they knew the way Toni Kukoc was as a person and they all treated me great. Everyone else who just read the newspapers and tried to learn about me, I guess I was not that good of a guy.
- Maybe two or three years will be enough for me to grow into a good NBA player.
- I feel as long as I'm playing productive minutes, I'll play. But if I'm sitting on the bench and not doing anything, then I'll retire.
- It would be nice to play again for a team that has a great chance to win a championship.
- There's a lot of things in my life that are more important I have to think about than what someone puts in the newspaper, or says on TV.
- I mean, if you're going to get traded, you're always looking for a good team to play with.
- I've been playing 10 years and I know it's easier starting the game. You have the opportunity to play much more aggressively.
- When some new guy wants to beat you, and you know you are better than him, you will make him see immediately who is the boss.

- Now if you ask me about coming from Europe, I would suggest to any young player interested in the NBA to not spend two or three years in Europe searching for money. Just give it a shot. You can always go back.
- I love Scottie. The guy that helped me the most those first two years was Scottie. He is so easy to play with.
- There is nothing personal between Pippen and me.
- I know that three months before the season is not enough to become a good NBA player, but it's a start.
