- I'm just throwing a name out there, but I think Nate Diaz and myself could actually put on a good show.
- I'm from the 805, man. I don't have to talk about where I'm from, but I'm tough.
- Wits always win, man, in the battle of brain versus brawn.
- Preparing for a short-notice fight is dangerous, it doesn't even matter who you are preparing for. Short-notice fights suck.
- I'm not one to throw anybody under a bus, but check this out: I'll be the first one to step in front of it.
- I'm tried of D'arce, D'arce, D'arcing people, but if I have to D'arce somebody else up, the D'arce Knight will return.
- People want to call me weird, 'cringey.'
- A jab is established through timing and that's how I take it. Cause I have a 76-inch reach but I'm not worried about range. I'm looking to establish that timing so I can see when that chin is available or I see that the nose is available, I can pop it.
- I can take a hit, I know I can hit back twice as hard.
- I'm looking for pound-for-pound list to be the best in the world and it takes belts to get there so let's get there.

- That's what I signed up for in the beginning. I was 170 pounds; 155 was forced on me.
- I don't want to be around people that bring me down.
- It would be nice to finish Khabib via liver shots, wouldn't it? I just want to see him wincing in pain on the ground where he belongs.
- I never make the same mistake twice. If you catch me slipping one time, good for you, but it ain't gonna happen again.
- What looks better with that 'Ultimate Fighter' plaque that's on my wall? That belt. I'll tell you what, I won't stop until I get it.
- I want to be a multi-division champ.
- I always knew and my parents always knew I was destined for greatness. I didn't know what sport it was going to be in. I played football, baseball and wrestling.

- This is an Olympic-level type of sport and it needs to be cleaned up.
- I'm a champion and I fight like a champion with or without that belt.
- I think I would pose a big threat at 145.
- One day, my bike tire broke miles from home and I found a way to fix it. That's what I learned: Even if you don't have all the tools, you can improvise.
- I like to push my body to just extremity to get past the mental toughness barriers. So fighting at 145, that would be great. If Kenny Florian can do it, I can do it.
- We've never had somebody to secure the legacy for the 155-pound division.
- Any of my previous fights before the UFC and 'the Ultimate Fighter' were all main events and co-main events.
- I thought Al Iaquinta did a great job at UFC 223, but Khabib is going to say he won the Super Bowl after he faced the third string? No way, dude. So many people hold him up on a high horse, but I see his flaws. I wasn't impressed with anything he did.
- If you don't show up, you lose.
- You can't really be one-dimensional in this fight game. If you are, you're going to get knocked out or you're going to get finished. Either that, or you're just going to take a lot of damage and you're just not going to be able to last very long.
- I always said the 155-pound belt's been in so many grubby hands, man.
- It's what you do after making a mistake - that's what I like to see. As long as you mature and grow with it, that's fine.
- You can't just learn wrestling overnight.
- I've never been much for the accolades and for the trophies and for the merits because at one time in my life I kind of got bored of all those.
- You put the pressure on this guy. You test his conditioning. You test the cardio. You test the heart, the will. That's how you beat RDA.
- You dangle a little bit of change in front of somebody and what do they do? They change right up like a chameleon.
- At my academy, I have a full 20x20 canvas but I don't have any ropes around it and do that for a reason so I don't get on my back on the ropes.
- I'm a fan pleaser.
- I've been training like an Olympian.
- I want to keep winning.
- All you guys out there that ever got bullied, I'm the guy that's going to help you guys.
- I'm gonna be always the main event.
- If I were to fight Khabib, guaran-damn-tee you I would throw him from his feet to his back and beat him like in sambo like a five-point move in wrestling. That's my background.
- Everybody wants to see this fight. Everybody wants to see these fireworks. They want to see that explosiveness. They want to see me throw Khabib on his back and get that five-point motion with this U.S.A. wrestling. Because if wrestling was easy, it would be called Sambo, my friend. Straight up, I'm going mop that dude up.
- It's interesting how Khabib fights but to me it's just boring, it's lazy.
- The torch needs to be held by somebody that's great. Because champions are made in the dark, baby. We don't need the lights and the spotlight. That stuff is for everybody else, man.

- I work hard for my stuff. And even when I work hard for my stuff, it gets taken away - which is cool. It's alright. You can't take my smile. And you won't.
- I'm an entertaining fighter.
- The UFC has a long history of changing a fighter's compensation for a particular bout... There's always changes that's always being made as far as contracts.
- Finesse is catching the baseball on the edge of your glove when you're turning two, making the one-handed grabs and shoestring tackles by running across the field in football. And finesse is what I bring to fighting.

- I'm the people's champ.
- The sport I'm in allows me to use my creativity.
- A lot of people like to trash talk, but I don't. I like to use my movements inside the cage to do my talking.
- I finished Edson Barboza in a d'arce choke. What else do you want? He's very hard to take down. Spinning heel kicks, spinning kicks. I took some of his most powerful shots and I just kept coming forward. I'm the Boogeyman out there.
- I always want to fight someone who is going to be game out there.
- The money will come to you, you've just got to keep winning.
- At the end of the day, does the UFC really like its fighters?

- I'm a superstar. And I move like a superstar in that Octagon, and I expect somebody to move like that when they signed that dotted line with me.
- I don't want to be a cookie-cutter-poster-boy-bubble-gum-chewing fighter.
- I don't want that title to come to my hands and be like, 'nah, I don't feel like it was deserved or it wasn't earned or whatever' - not saying that any of my accolades weren't, but I want it to be special. I want it to be super special and just super dope, and even if it's not special to everybody else, at least it is to me.
- I like to have job security.
- I'm beefy. I feel good at 170. My wife loves me at 170.
- It's not just about knockouts, son. This is mixed martial arts. It's about finishing people. It's about putting in that time, putting in all five rounds.
- I'm not someone to joke around with.
- Well, being my type of fighter and my type of guy, you know I throw a lot of barrage of punches, kicks, knees and elbows.
- I don't fight for anybody else besides myself and my family, so therefore I win.

- Starting at age 6, I was helping install the Formica table tops with that strong glue. My dad was the master. I was the apprentice. I'd be in there working until I'd be telling him, 'I feel woozy,' and he'd say, 'Go outside, son.' So I'd go organize his tools. He used the best ones made.
- I'm tired of labels. This is my label right here: El Cucuy.
- I might not always be given the respect that I should have, but it's what fuels me.
- You don't have to use aggression to squash somebody. You have to use your brain.
- The lightweight title will be mine, but I'm looking for multiples and I am looking for that best pound for pound spot.
- This is a man's sport. I fight.
- I can go down to 145. I can kick everyone's butt there.
- I own 170 and 155. These are my weight classes.
- We all have to pay our bills. We all have to pay our taxes. Straight up.
- When I first started fighting, it wasn't the easiest thing. I didn't have all the money in the world. I was eating Subway once in a while, some packets of oatmeal here and there. It wasn't that bad, but it's because I was fortunate and had good people there to support me.
- I don't want to be close with anyone who's wishy-washy.
- Opportunity sometimes comes once in a lifetime.
- Don't give me an easy fight. I want somebody that's worth it, that's put in their time and put in the amount of effort.
