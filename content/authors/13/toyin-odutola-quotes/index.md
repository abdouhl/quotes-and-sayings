quotes = ['''It's kind of a language I've developed over time that's basically breaking up the face into components and planes. Inside each plane, I draw gradation marks, and when planes come together, they form sinews, a hairlike weave that's like a landscape of the face.''' ,'''I don't think about race before I start drawing. I think about how to make that mark to fit whatever purpose I need it to fulfill.''' ,'''I moved around a lot when I was a child; two of the houses I grew up in have totally disappeared. One was burnt in a riot, and the other was pulled down.''' ,'''My identity is not based on performance; it's based on something that's pre-determined by someone else, and I don't even understand what that is because I'm an African who came to America.''' ,'''When I was in school, I conceptually didn't want black people to have context, to take it out of all that history. I wanted nothing to indicate where they are or what time it is, to place them anywhere.''' ,'''I'm really interested in independent publishers and memes and mini comics. But even before that, I was interested in Japanese manga and anime.''' ,'''The social media bit is really about documenting process. I like the dialogue if it's constructive, but I'm now at a crossroads.
