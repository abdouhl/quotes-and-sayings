- No matter how good you are, your mentality has got to be right. A lot of young players, that's where they go wrong, and that's what I've always seen when I was growing up - players who are almost there but couldn't quite get there because the mentality wasn't right.
- I started playing football with my mates and my brothers, in the playground or the park or the front garden. It was just about enjoying it, having a good time playing. I wanted to play all the time.

- As long as everyone does their part - the attackers score the goals, and the defenders keep the clean sheets - then you can't go too wrong.
- When I was growing up, I was focused on football and school.

- I try not to pay too much respect to the players I am playing against.

- It's something you dream of. It's very special to play in the Merseyside derby and, especially, win.
- Technology is playing an increasingly important role in the life of a footballer, and I guess that is true across most sports now.
- I was about six, and Liverpool had a community summer camp. They sent a few invites to my school and my age group, to my class specifically, and they were like, 'Who wants to go?' So every lad in the class put their hands up, as you'd imagine, so the only fair way was to pick names out of a hat, and luckily, my name was picked out.

- As long as possible, I want to have that relationship with Liverpool, to be a Liverpool player. To say I have done that for the whole of my career is something I have dreamed of being able to say.
- No matter what the competition is, we're not going to take it easy. We're going to fight for it and try and win as much silverware as we can.

- To be a Premier League player is something that not everyone can say; even some of the best players in the world can't say that!

- I'm just a lad playing for Liverpool, trying to achieve his dream, so to see a lad with my name on his shirt - when I grew up having the names of other players on my shirt - it meant a lot.

- That is probably the best thing to do: look back on the harder games you've had, the tougher games, learn what I didn't do well and what I could have done better.
- That is how I have been brought up - to never give up, never take anything for granted.
- Until I am playing every game all season for a couple of seasons, I am always going to be striving for better.
