I thought that the improv classes would help with my wrestling career, which it has.''' ,'''I'm missing a knuckle, it's crushed inside my hand at the moment.''' ,'''Recently, I went up to Casino Rama to see Martin Short's show, just to see how he put it all together. And after the show, I went backstage and picked his brain to find out why he did certain things.''' ,'''Oh, gosh, okay... well, my biggest injury was probably a bone chip in my ankle that required surgery.''' ,]
