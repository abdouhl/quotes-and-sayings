- If you are going to go to a medium, go to a medium as a skeptic... and this is a medium telling you this! Because if someone is a medium and they are legit, they're not going to be shocked by skepticism, they're not going to be taken aback or intimidated by skepticism.
- I can work with skeptics - cynics are a little bit harder because they already have their mind made up. There's nothing that I'm going to say that's going to change that.
- When I'm not doing readings, I just spend a lot of time alone and try to meditate. Going for walks in nature is also really good for me. It's a way to center myself without having people around, because my ability is less of an on-off switch. It's more like a radio volume dial, so I always have background music in my head.
- I would love to be able to tour and get to be able to read people who might not be able to afford to go to L.A. and really just spread my ability and share it as much as I possibly can.
- My closest friends do come to me all the time about their personal life for advice but we have healthy boundaries!

- A lot of people I read start off as skeptics or nonbelievers. There comes a point in every reading when you see their worldview being changed.
- What I do isn't for everyone and I totally respect that.
- I think that we can learn a lot from the first-hand experiences of others and I think that if you look at these readings - celebrities or not - there's information that comes through that is so specific and personal there's no way you could research that.
- I think I just grew up with this receptivity that a lot of people might shut down at an early age because of the influences around them. I didn't really have that, so it just allowed me to trust what I see, hear and feel a lot more. It allowed me to have more confidence in going with my gut.
- The things that make us unique, the things that make us different, the sometimes unique positions we're in our calling. By sticking true, we can ultimately do something that can change the world for the better.
- A good way to tell if a psychic is authentic is, if they are going to verbalise these things, it should be with the intention of helping the person.
- My goal with any reading is always to give the client what they are meant to hear.
- Sometimes getting an idea of the trajectory we're on can be helpful and knowing where to go and what to avoid.
- I had graduated high school early, and my thought was to become a hospice nurse.
- I usually go straight for coffee when I wake up. I start my day with a half hour meditation... but only after a cup of coffee. Caffeination with meditation might sound funny, but it's how I don't fall back asleep in the morning!
- It's really surreal watching myself on television because I pick up on all my mannerisms. You really get to see yourself in a completely different light when you actually watch yourself.
- What I've found after doing over 200 celebrity readings on 'Hollywood Medium' is that everyone is looking for the same thing, it doesn't matter how rich you are, how poor you are, how famous or not famous, every human being experiences loss and I'm glad the show starts a conversation about that.
- A lot of the people that I read have never had a medium experience before - it's comforting.
- I believe the readings I do are a validation that there is more to this world than what we can see.
- Having quiet time mentally is key in harnessing our intuition, and being awake when others are asleep allows for us to be with our thoughts.
- Yes. I get scared sometimes if I don't know when a physical sensation is going to go away. For example, if I get a chest pain it's grandpa trying to say 'heart attack' and I verbalize 'grandpa had a heart attack' and the pain goes away. But there's sometimes that I'll verbalize and the pain is till there, and then it doesn't go away.
- I'm too much of a hippy for the east coast.
- I like to think of religion as languages, our religion is very cultural, it has a lot to do with where we are born on this planet, it can really impact our religious beliefs.
- People stop me and ask me about their loved ones who have passed away. I have to explain to them that what I do is a lot like therapy and it really requires the right time and the right place.

- I think there are so many misconceptions about mediums.
- I would say the nature of what I do can be very overwhelming and some things revolve around things that are not positive. But I cannot allow fear to dictate my readings.
- I just try to help the people I can.
- My readings are really about connecting people, whether it's to their deceased loved ones and finding the closure through that or connecting them to insight into their personal lives. Those are the connections that I aim to make and those are what make the biggest difference.
- Oftentimes reoccurring dreams are ways a loved one is trying to come through and deliver a message.
- Making chocolate with RuPaul, it doesn't get much better than that honestly. That's the dream; that's what everyone aspires to do.
- I don't know if anyone can do a reading for other people, but I do think that we all have an intuition and that if we can follow it we can hone it and it can be used to do a lot of good.

- In reading celebrities, public figures, their lives are on Google! So, obviously, there's information about them.
- I'm learning more and more from every reading that I do. When people come through they're not talking about heaven or hell, but I definitely see that there's a continuation of life and that we do still have the ability to connect to our loved ones and the love that we share with them.
- Tilda Swinton would be a great person to a reading on because I think she is such an interesting and fascinating person. To see a personal side to her would be really intriguing.
- I believe if someone is authentic, they shouldn't have to advertise. If you can really talk to the dead, people are going to hear about it.
- I think sometimes people expect people to burst into tears. But, I think sometimes emotion, as I've seen, shock, can have a lot of different manifestations. Sometimes it's tears and sometimes it's just complete stoicism.

- If I allowed fear to dictate my life, I would not be productive.
- I grew up in a very small conservative town and as a result there were a lot of people who didn't like what I did. So I would say for anyone who is dealing with bullying, regardless if it's not to do with being a medium, I know what it's like to be alienated and feel different.
- My favorite part of my job is really getting to connect people to their loved ones and, really, to allow them to have a release and be able to come into a session not knowing what they're wanting or expecting, and be able to leave it feeling a sense of healing and a sense of closure.
- I see Khloe Kardashian pretty regularly, we cross paths a lot.
- My sixth sense uses the other five senses to communicate. I may have a vision, hear a sound, get a smell, or have a physical sensation that corresponds with how someone passed. What I do revolves around noticing subtle differences in my mind and body - because they're messages.
- Being a medium, a lot of religious people are like, 'ok. that's talking to the dead.' The bible talks about it in a very different context so I think there's more stigma to being a medium.

- I've learned never to generalise and that regardless of our differences, we all share the same fundamental human experiences.
- Situations we might write off as a coincidence could actually be a late loved one trying to send us a sign.
- Somehow, I've become Hollywood's go-to medium.
- Ultimately I look at the long-term goal of communicating messages. Although I've seen some traumatic things, delivering messages of comfort and closure allow for a sense of peace.
- Readings all have their own intricacies but every reading has been fulfilling, even the challenging ones.
- Love life readings are my least favorite things to do in the world because I can sit with Amber Rose and say look 'I'm seeing a 'T' name. This is gonna happen, stick with that relationship. Don't date a rapper.' And then she'll go and date a rapper.
- I don't claim to have all the answers about how the afterlife works.
- I think you don't need to add anything into your life to be more intuitive, it's more a matter of taking away things that are distracting us from being intuitive.
- I think we all have the ability to tap into this inherent connection that really connects us all.
- Every reading is different as far as timing, so some will last a half hour and others will last three hours.
- For me, it's really important when I go into a reading to not have any bias and so that's a big reason why I never know who I'm meeting or where I'm going.
- My reading with RuPaul was actually, for me, on a personal level, one of my favorites and the most shocking. This is someone I've wanted to read for a long time and so when he was standing there I nearly fainted.
- I'm an only child, so I don't really have any siblings to drive me nuts.
- I think for me, growing up as an only child, I didn't have a lot of people around me or a lot of foreign influences, so growing up, I really kind of got lost in my imagination - for the better.
- As a medium reading people in the public eye it really is my job to read information from my clients that isn't out there publicly and really tap into those private details.
- Some of us are born with a heightened sense of intuition and others less so, but being open to seeing the signs and synchronicity I think is important.
- I always say, I can tell everybody else's future except my own.
- It's really important to differentiate between being sceptical and cynical.
- Dreams, I would say, are probably the most prevalent way a loved one will try to deliver a message.
- When I'm being driven to the reading, my mom doesn't know who the client is. My assistant, Charlie, does not know who the client is. We follow a lead vehicle... so we don't know where we're going.
- For me, the goal of a reading is fundamentally to help the person get closure or insight, and so sharing negative information without any positive silver lining or any potential resolution is pointless.
- Heart issues, they happen to men, it's not uncommon.
- I embrace skeptics.
- One of the beauties of intuition is that if I was interacting with someone that didn't feel right or they were kind of creeped out by what I was able to do, then they clearly weren't the right fit.
- In a reading, I might hear a voice, see an image or even get a physical sensation that corresponds with how someone passed.
- In life we grow and step out of our comfort zone... but the more I do it the better.
- When I meet people, I relay things I see and feel. And in a reading when I interact with a person, I'll pick up on sensations and feelings and piece them together to make a coherent thought. My goal is to always get specific information and relay details that people will connect to.
- In my opinion I think there's a difference between skepticism and cynicism; I tend to avoid cynicism because I feel it can err sometimes on the side of ignorance, by just disregarding something without actually seeing it or experiencing it first-hand.
- Doing readings is so gratifying that it makes any physical intensity worth it for me.
- I would say that if you can stick to who you are as a person, that's all that matters.
