- Like, man, I would love to wrestle Roman Reigns. I would love to wrestle Gable, or Shorty G, I would love to.
- If you embrace it, I think being an underdog becomes more of an advantage than anything.
- I wanted to build respect with my peers... I felt like I had done that throughout my WWE career. I really felt it and knew it was there when I got injured.
- Stuff happens. We perform at such a high level so many days a week that things are going to happen. We just have to do the best we can to take care of each other and to let a person know that we're there for them when they do get hurt.
- I don't know if it breaks my heart to say it or not, but I feel like my legacy might be more behind the scenes than it ever was in the ring.
- You don't have to sever your spinal cord to be paralyzed for life. You could just touch it and be paralyzed for life.
- To all of a sudden go from feeling almost invincible to being temporarily paralyzed to then having rods and screws in my neck and not really being able to move around to seeing my body change, I definitely, definitely, definitely did not feel myself at all.
- My tryout match for WWE was against Kofi. I was unsigned, and then I got signed by working the dark matches. I wrestled with Kofi in my first TV match at Deep South Wrestling. We've done single matches, tag matches, all the way to producing.
- My main goal is to leave everything I have out there in that ring at every arena.
- I haven't wrestled in five years almost. June 1st, 2015 was my last match, and I'm at peace with it. I love what I do now, and being a part of working with the talent.
- I'm a constant work in progress, always working on every aspect to get better and better. You're always going to see a different Tyson Kidd.
- Wrestling and WWE has given me a good opportunity as a talent. I just want to give back and give everything that I can now that I physically can't do this anymore.
- So, the role of a producer is to kind of look at the show, kind of give our takes on what we see, and that'll be prior to the production meeting. Then, we kind of get assigned our matches and our segments, and then we - I like to go and collaborate with talent, and we put together what we see on TV every Monday and Friday.
- If you're afraid and don't let yourself get to empty, you'll never build your conditioning. I learned that from my Japanese trainer, Tokyo Joe, a long time ago.
- There's an unwritten protocol when you hurt somebody. And when I say you hurt somebody, obviously it's not on purpose, but it still happens. I know I've rocked guys before where I checked on them after to make sure everything's cool.
- You know, if you read a book, once you get to chapter five and stuff starts stepping up, it doesn't mean chapters one to four didn't happen. They happened, but now we're on the next chapter, and that's how I'd like to be perceived.
- I lived with Stu Hart and the rest of the Hart's. So, I could go to the Hart Dungeon any time I wanted.
- I lost feeling for about five seconds. Everything. Head to toe. Times ten. You just sit there in no control. I was in no control, I was at a higher power's mercy. You're just sitting there, all of a sudden your body feels like it weighs like two million pounds.
- I have to show the WWE Universe that I can be versatile.
- I do wish my career had kept going. I think sometimes people think that we know everything in advance. We don't.
- Wrestling, at its core, is all about fan and audience participation and fan interaction live in that Arena. Live in that bingo hall, live in that gymnasium, whatever it is, man, I've wrestled in all of them.
- I want to win the title and defend it around the world and have it seen on 'Total Divas.' I want the NXT Championship to be worldwide, so everybody knows what it is.
- Before I got hurt, I was on the road five days a week and then I'd come home for a day and a half. And some of those times, I'd be filming Total Divas, so at some point I was working seven days a week, which I was cool. I loved it.
- When we lay something out and the talent goes out there, I'm part of the creative process of helping putting things together maybe putting things in different places. When they go out there and execute it even better than I have it imagined in my head, it is just a great feeling.
- But I'm not going to let my knee alter anything I do in the ring. My move set is part of what makes me unique and there's no way I'm going to throw that away out of fear.
- I'm out to prove that NXT is not to be overlooked, that it's not a stepping stone or an easy place to compete. Every single guy and girl down there is hungry.
- There's only one way to train, and that's being in the ring. And even in practice, it's not the same as performing in front of a crowd.
- Even though I do feel great right now, there is a chance that if I were to try to wrestle that I might reinjure myself. It might not be in that first match back and may not be in that second match back, but there is a chance.
- I did, one time, over the past couple years look into maybe doing a little something in a Royal Rumble, just kind of as that, so that could be my last chapter, so the last time you see me is, y'know, this little thing, and it didn't work out.
- When I saw Air Boom perform, I went out of my mind. It was two guys with high-octane offence forming a team. It was exciting.
- Having a chance to work with Dusty Rhodes, he has helped me so much that I can't even praise how much. The first time I saw him on WWE television in polka dots I never would have thought that guy would be such an influence on my career.
- I liked helping talent with their matches prior to my injury. Obviously, now as a producer it becomes more a larger responsibility than just me as a talent giving advice. What I didn't know was I didn't know how fulfilling it could actually be.
- I didn't fracture my neck, I didn't break it, but technically it's actually worse. The ligament holding the C2 ruptured, so my disc hit my spinal cord.
- In Tampa, it's not that cold but it gets dark early here compared to Calgary.
- So if I see what I will call like a beautiful match, if I watch it at home by myself, I'll have a hard time not in tears watching these matches.
- I'm like coal under pressure. I turn into a diamond.
- The main thing is that everything is taped at Full Sail. It is kind of like competing on home turf every time in terms of the tapings and specials. The main roster travels, I am in Hartford for live Smackdown, then head to Edmonton and Calgary and Denver. It is travel travel travel. NXT is more stationary.
- If you take a look back at my body of work in the ring, I'm so happy that I had that NXT run... It sucks that my in-ring career came to an end, but I'm glad that I had that full-year body of work.
- I want to entertain the audience. I want the people to get their money's worth.
- Adrian Neville should expect absolutely everything out of me. Like I said, he is going to be facing Tyson Kidd at his absolute best. I've got nothing to lose, and there's nothing more dangerous than a guy with nothing to lose.
- I have zero animosity with Samoa Joe. I found him my first day back at WWE after my injury and we had a very good heart to heart. I wish him nothing but the best.
- The respect from your peers - I don't know if it's because I grew up in the business, I don't know if that's why - but to me, that became the biggest thing.
- Just sitting in a steam room, you can't breathe. When you're doing Hindu squats in one and you get past 100, your whole body feels numb and you keep going. You start to find your limits and push your body past those limits, making new ones.
- In 2011, I had a big chip on my shoulder, and I felt like I had a lot to prove every time I went out there. It led to good performances, but sometimes backstage, I could be - not to the talent, but just in general - I could be angry.
- I'm a giant UFC fan. Huge. I watch UFC all the time.
- After being temporarily paralyzed, it puts a lot of things in perspective.
- As soon as I got hurt Kurt Angle reached out to me, Steve Austin reached out to me, and Edge, who I already had a pretty good relationship with.
- I love sitting and collaborating with people and just being creative and we are all throwing out ideas and next thing you know some magic is being made in the ring that I had a small little part in.
