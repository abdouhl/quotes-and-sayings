- I have been obscenely lucky. I've got most of the things I've asked for and done well at the things I've wanted to succeed at.
- I've just finished reading 'The Second Plane,' and I think it's some of the best non-fiction I've ever read.
- I was the first and only person in my family to go to university, and I spent two decades redesigning myself: even my voice is the product of elocution lessons.
- Where writers are from is one of the world' s most boring topics. Where we're born, gender or race, wealth or poverty - those are the things we spend time talking about. Stop trying to label me. I'm a writer. Worry about whether I'm any good!
- I might live in Manhattan or Edinburgh or Cardiff. I think of myself as without nationality.
- From the age of eighteen to twenty-one, I worked any job I could get my hands on. One of these jobs was selling fake paintings door-to-door.
- Law gave me some structure... all these rules and internal disciplines.
- I get into all sorts of trouble with my publicists and with newspapers because I won't do photographs.
- Before MS moved in on me, I'd worked for seven years as a city lawyer, as the editor of a literary magazine, and before the age of 20, I'd also worked as a cadet journalist and as an assistant director in both film and TV. And then, after the lesions of MS, both on my spine and in my brain, I was the opposite of bionic.
- Life is ruthless, and its bestowal of fortune arbitrary and capricious. I'd been born to morons, and mine was a shabby life.
- I've never experienced writer's block. When it's going really well, my body temperature goes up, and I'm flushed. I get quite delirious.
- I grew up in a bookless house with a father and brother who have spent most of their lives in prison, psychiatric hospitals, or living rough, and a mother who has spent her life slaving and scrimping to pay the bills, living a nervous and troubled life.
- As is the case for many people with multiple sclerosis, the effects of weakened limbs, spasticity and fatigue had cut my working life in half. Yet not a single GP, neurologist or nurse, and none of the MS websites, had mentioned the use of neuroenhancers for the treatment of neurological fatigue.
