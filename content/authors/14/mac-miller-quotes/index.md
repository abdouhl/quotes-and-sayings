- When you feel sad, it's okay. It's not the end of the world. Everyone has those days when you doubt yourself, and when you feel like everything you do sucks, but then there's those days when you feel like Superman. It's just the balance of the world. I just write to feel better.

The studio's become the sanctuary that people have come in and found new things out about themselves, as weird as that sounds. But it's true, I'm no different. I've made some crazy hard records, and I've made a jazz album.

- Just because someone may or may not have someone that writes some words for them doesn't mean that, A, they don't have to kill it on the performance, and, B, they don't have to have the ear for what's tight and what's not, which is something a lot of people don't have.
