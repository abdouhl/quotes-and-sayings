They want to leave - so let us let them leave.''' ,'''And also I assert our interest in respecting all our obligations and implementing all our commitments. And will save no effort whatever to protect this newborn opportunity of peace, that is provided through what we have already declared here today.''' ,'''We have accepted the principle of democracy and we are committed to respect the popular verdict and the result of that national consultation.''' ,'''There is a requirement to ensure the withdrawal takes place in a civilized manner. We will be able to show the world we deserve independence and freedom.''' ,'''Let us all pledge to protect this opportunity in order to see that the wish of peace becomes a true and daily fact in this region.''' ,'''It is high time that the Palestinian people restore their freedom and independence. It is high time that the decades, the long decades of suffering and pain would stop.''' ,'''Here, I declare that the Palestine Liberation Organization is ready to return immediately to the negotiating table on the basis of the adopted terms of reference based on international legitimacy and a complete cessation of settlement activities.''' ,'''I say: The time has come for my courageous and proud people, after decades of displacement and colonial occupation and ceaseless suffering, to live like other peoples of the earth, free in a sovereign and independent homeland.''' ,'''I can certainly put myself in Israel's shoes. They are humans just like we are. They want peace and security inside their borders.''' ,'''We differ on several issues. And this may include settlement, the release of prisoners, the wall closing institutions in Jerusalem.''' ,'''Israel reoccupied the cities of the West Bank by a unilateral action, and reestablished the civil and military occupation by a unilateral action, and it is the one that determines whether or not a Palestinian citizen has the right to reside in any part of the Palestinian Territory.''' ,'''The time has come to end the suffering and the plight of millions of Palestine refugees in the homeland and the Diaspora, to end their displacement and to realize their rights, some of them forced to take refuge more than once in different places of the world.''' ,]
