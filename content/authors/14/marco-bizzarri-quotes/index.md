- We say that our world must think of and listen to consumers, and this is true, but not too much, in the sense that if you want to change and innovate, you must also think with your own head. Maybe you make choices that the market is not ready to accept but that will be accepted in 18 or 24 months.
- Diversity and inclusion, which are the real grounds for creativity, must remain at the center of what we do.
- I tend to make my most important decisions by following my instincts rather than any straightforward logic.

- In a company like Gucci, you can lose millions and millions in a second.

- I wanted to have a creative director crazy enough to say, 'Sure, I'll do a collection in five days.'
- The kind of contact that they make with the customer is what brings them back to shop. The experience, the feeling that you have in the store is what makes the difference.
- From a branding standpoint, the show represents only a fraction of our business, and the impact you actually have on the consumer is super, super tiny. I mean, what about the pre-collection? That is just as important as the show.
