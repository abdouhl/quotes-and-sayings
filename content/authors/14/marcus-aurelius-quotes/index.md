Realize this, and you will find strength.''' ,'''Perhaps there are none more lazy, or more truly ignorant, than your everlasting readers.''' ,'''The universal order and the personal order are nothing but different expressions and manifestations of a common underlying principle.''' ,'''The soul becomes dyed with the color of its thoughts.''' ,'''Let men see, let them know, a real man, who lives as he was meant to live.''' ,'''A man's worth is no greater than his ambitions.''' ,'''Let not your mind run on what you lack as much as on what you have already.''' ,'''And thou wilt give thyself relief, if thou doest every act of thy life as if it were the last.''' ,'''Look back over the past, with its changing empires that rose and fell, and you can foresee the future, too.''' ,'''Whatever the universal nature assigns to any man at any time is for the good of that man at that time.''' ,'''Begin - to begin is half the work, let half still remain; again begin this, and thou wilt have finished.''' ,'''Waste no more time arguing about what a good man should be.
