- I trust the people who are working with me. I delegate.
- There is no better protection against the euro crisis than successful structural reforms in southern Europe.
- Interest rates do not have to be identical across the whole euro area, but it is unacceptable if major differences arise from broken capital markets or concern about a euro area break-up.
