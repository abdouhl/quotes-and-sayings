quotes = ['''The job of the poet is to render the world - to see it and report it without loss, without perversion. No poet ever talks about feelings. Only sentimental people do.''' ,'''The art of teaching is the art of assisting discovery.''' ,'''Wit is the only wall between us and the dark.''' ,'''Nothing in man is more serious than his sense of humor; it is the sign that he wants all the truth.''' ,'''Bring ideas in and entertain them royally, for one of them may be the king.''' ,'''To fail to love is not to exist at all.''' ,'''The genius of the Marx Brothers is for parody.
