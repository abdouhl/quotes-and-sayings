- There is something that has become part of my routine that I eat two or three times a week. Sushi. It exists in Europe but isn't very popular, and especially in L.A., I started eating it. It's both tasty and healthy.
- I lived in L.A. for four years, and basically, every corner you go to, or in a restaurant, you can't even find people from the same background.
- I have become a subscriber for 'Business Week.' It teaches me a lot about business, and I have really started to get into it. I'm interested in business and learning about how everything works.
- I used to dye my hair different colors and have crazy periods, especially early in my career when I played in Italy.
