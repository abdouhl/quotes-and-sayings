quotes = ['''The position is clear - there is no ambiguity in Sinn Fein's position. We, along with all the other parties, have signed up to a reduced rate of corporation tax of 12.5 % by 2018.''' ,'''Commemorations can stimulate debate, which will ultimately lead to a greater understanding of the events of our 'through-other' history and to shape a better future.''' ,'''World War One is an important part of Ireland's multi-layered history during which tens of thousands Irish people lost their lives.''' ,'''Our visits to the United States have brought huge benefits by helping attract foreign direct investment on a scale not previously seen in the north of Ireland.''' ,'''It is amazing that you now have a bus company in Ballymena producing world class buses for Hong Kong, Singapore, London and Las Vegas.''' ,'''Our ability to make a decision about the declaration is hampered by the British government being reluctant to give us the clarification which we require.''' ,'''The people who were marching at Peggy O'Hara's funeral gave the impression they were associated with the INLA, which is supposed to be on ceasefire and to have decommissioned some of their weapons. I ask if they could have honoured her in a more dignified way.''' ,'''I don't think the majority of people - to be quite honest - care. I think they see me as someone who was at one stage of my life in the IRA, but they see me in the round, as someone who was able to make peace.''' ,'''Ireland's place north and south is in Europe and leading change in Europe.''' ,'''You could count on the fingers of one hand the number of people in the north who said to me, 'When did you leave the IRA?'''' ,'''I don't hate Peter Robinson, and I don't think Peter Robinson hates me.''' ,'''Obviously, Ian Paisley and I were regarded as very bitter opponents. When we decided in March 2007 to govern together, both of us understood that we weren't going to change our views but that we had to work with one another if we were to end the conflict and move forward.''' ,'''I'm not going to be known as the Sinn Fein Minister who did the bidding of a Tory administration which is focused on decimating the welfare state.''' ,'''On a number of occasions, I have made it clear that Sinn Fein policy was to argue for the establishment of an independent, international truth commission.''' ,'''I think people see me as someone very much associated with political agreement and, probably more than anything else, being able to build a relationship with loyalist leaders Ian Paisley and Peter Robinson.''' ,'''That's healthy and good for us that there are people who are prepared to question what we are doing.''' ,'''The engagements I had with Queen Elizabeth and Prince Charles were about reaching out and showing respect to the unionist people. I also recognised that when someone like her makes acts of reconciliation as she did do at the Garden of Remembrance in Dublin, she is 100% behind the peace process.''' ,'''Well I think it has always been a mistake to reduce the peace process in Ireland to a decommissioning process.''' ,'''War is terrible. There is nothing romantic about war.''' ,'''We don't believe that winning elections and winning any amount of votes will win freedom in Ireland. At the end of the day, it will be the cutting edge of the IRA which will bring freedom.''' ,'''Sinn Fein is the fastest growing party on the island of Ireland.''' ,'''There is not much point in establishing an organisation like the independent commission for information retrieval, or the other organisations that we agreed to, if we do not encourage people to participate.''' ,'''It was traumatic for my children to see the British army en masse coming into our home and searching the house. I recall on one occasion, when our home was raided, my youngest son was standing at the top of the stairs - he would probably have been only three years of age - in his pyjamas. The soldiers came up the stairs, and he peed himself.''' ,'''The war against British rule must continue until freedom is achieved.''' ,'''The spirt of 1916 is as relevant and inspiring today as it was a century ago.''' ,'''The sheer scale of what the Tories are attempting to do is staggering. But Sinn Fein will not agree to this ideologically driven austerity agenda.''' ,'''It is Cameron's cabinet of millionaires who are the real spongers given free rein to live out their Thatcherite fantasies at the expense of ordinary, decent communities throughout these islands.''' ,'''Sinn Fein will not do Tory austerity.''' ,'''If Britain votes to leave the European Union, then that could have huge implications for the entire island of Ireland and, given all the predictions, would run counter to the democratic wishes of the Irish people.''' ,'''I would describe myself as a practising Catholic. This is only my opinion; others may disagree.''' ,'''The task ahead of us will be extremely challenging as the Tory party continue with their austerity agenda and as we continue to resolve the issues of the past and build unity, reconciliation, and equality.''' ,'''I believed that, in a situation where the community that I came from were being treated like second- and third-class citizens, that I had a responsibility to fight back against it. And I don't apologise to anybody for having done that. I think it was the right thing to do.''' ,'''When I went to the all-Ireland final - Kerry against Dublin - I couldn't get away for an hour and a half with people coming up and wishing me all the best. Not one of them said, 'Martin, when did you leave the IRA?' But every one of them knew I was in the IRA at one stage.''' ,'''I will not be silenced or deterred.''' ,'''My ultimate dream would be for Derry City to become champions of an all-Ireland league in a united Ireland.''' ,'''I am opposed to abortion on demand, and I am opposed to the 1967 Act in Britain being transferred to the north.''' ,'''As a young man on the streets of Derry, I saw Ian Paisley as an immortal opponent of everything to do with equality, justice, fairness, and respect for Irishness.''' ,'''I will work with whoever is leader of the DUP.''' ,'''I never talk about shooting anybody, but I do acknowledge I was a member of the IRA, and as a member of the IRA, I obviously engaged in fighting back against the British army.''' ,'''There are many things we can do with Scotland and, indeed, with others which would be hugely beneficial to both Scotland and to Ireland, so I'm absolutely up for all of that.''' ,'''I have huge respect for Nicola Sturgeon and for the SNP.''' ,'''I have passed, I hope, many tests over the course of the last 20-odd years in relation to the peace process and intend to continue to work forward in a very sensible and reasoned way with political colleagues in the Executive.''' ,'''But the fact is that the vast majority of Republicans support the Sinn Fein leadership.''' ,'''Tony Blair has made a good contribution to the cause of peace in Ireland. He has made a great effort to understand it. He has great empathy with the need to resolve the conflict.''' ,'''Let us walk into the conference room as equals and not second class citizens.''' ,'''I know who Queen Elizabeth represents. I know she's the head of the British state. I know she has all sorts of titles in relation to different regiments in the British army. She knows my history. She knows I was a member of the IRA. She knows I was in conflict with her soldiers, yet both of us were prepared to rise above all of that.''' ,'''A lot of Labour people are telling me Labour is in poor shape.''' ,'''I think that what is happening now in terms of the Brexit vote does represent a serious undermining of the Good Friday Agreement.''' ,'''Within loyalism and the UVF, there are clearly people who are not just aggravated by the issue around flags or parades. They're aggravated by me and Sinn Fein being in government. They're opposed to the political institutions - there's an inability of a minority within loyalism to accept the concept of equality.''' ,'''I haven't done anything that I'm ashamed of.''' ,'''In fact, I would defend to the death their right to express a different point of view.''' ,'''Sinn Fein is the only political party on this island working to end that fracture in their nation and to achieving the Republic set out in the proclamation.''' ,'''I think that Peter Mandelson, particularly in relation to the issue of policing, made a huge mess of it. He allowed himself to be manipulated by the securocrats within the British establishment.''' ,'''I do have a very deep sense of regret that there was a conflict and that people lost their lives, and you know, many were responsible for that - and a lot of them wear pinstripe suits in London today.''' ,'''Unlike the Tory millionaires, I live in the heart of the proud working-class community of the Bogside in Derry.''' ,'''As a lad growing up in the Fifties and Sixties, I played both Gaelic football and soccer and loved them both.''' ,'''I lost a lot of friends at the hands of the British Army. The person who actually introduced me to my wife, Colm Keenan, was murdered by the British Army. He was a member of the IRA, but he was unarmed.''' ,'''In 2016, let us all join the Rising, and the only final message is this very clear: Up the Rebels. Up a sovereign and independent Irish republic.''' ,'''Let me put it like this: I am not prepared to officiate over on behalf of the British government what I think is a disastrous strategy which will impact on some of the most vulnerable and poorest people within our society.''' ,'''We've had a very consistent position down the years. Sinn Fein is not in favour of abortion, and we resisted any attempt to bring the British 1967 Abortion Act to the north.''' ,'''All I can do is to try and make the future better.''' ,'''The British government says that for Sinn Fein to be involved in talks the guns must be left at the door.''' ,'''There are no military solutions - dialogue and diplomacy are the only guarantee of lasting peace.''' ,'''I was proud to be a member of the IRA. I am still 40 years on proud that I was a member of the IRA. I am not going to be a hypocrite and sit here and say something different.''' ,'''The fact is that a car used by Gerry Adams and myself during the course of the Mitchell review was bugged by elements within British military intelligence.''' ,'''I want to work with Peter Robinson as first minister in a positive, constructive way and leave the elections to the electorate.''' ,'''While others have walked away from their responsibilities, the Sinn Fein team will work with the other ministers in partnership to deliver for all the people.''' ,'''I don't cheer when people lose their lives.''' ,'''Obviously everybody is accountable for their own actions, and everybody has to make judgments based on their own conscience as to whether or not they believe what they were doing is right or wrong.''' ,'''Sinn Fein is committed to promoting and enhancing reconciliation, and in recent years, I and other members of my party have taken a number of significant initiatives aimed to advance this process.''' ,'''If the British government is prepared to say that the Unionists will not have a veto over British government policy and that guns, vetoes and injustices will all be left outside the door, then there is no good reason why talks cannot take place in an appropriate atmosphere.''' ,'''The most important thing to say is that Sinn Fein isn't going back to anything. We are a party on the move.''' ,'''The Good Friday Agreement was an incredible breakthrough. But it's my view that the Hillsborough Agreement could see politics in the north come of age, and see us all move forwards on the basis of equality and partnership.''' ,'''What's important is that, when you're tested, you stand firm against the violent activities of those who would try to plunge our people back into the misery of the past.''' ,'''Austerity is devastating these communities. The working poor, public sector workers, the disabled, and the vulnerable are the hardest hit by this bankrupt and ideologically driven policy.''' ,'''In my view, a united Ireland is inevitable, and it is certainly more likely than a voluntary coalition which doesn't include Sinn Fein.''' ,'''As anyone who has tinnitus knows, it's not something that you can ignore, and you have to deal with it on a daily basis.''' ,'''My parents were very religious. My mother came from Co Donegal to work in the shirt factory in Derry when she met my father.''' ,'''I remember vividly as a 15-year-old, in 1964, seeing Derry play Glentoran in the Irish Cup Final at Windsor Park in Belfast. Glentoran were one of the two big Belfast teams, along with Linfield. Any rural team playing them was up against the odds.''' ,'''Along with that ongoing process Sinn Fein took a decision to establish a peace commission which had the responsibility to travel around the country to receive submissions from the general public, also our opponents.''' ,'''Bill Clinton was one of the greatest presidents that we've seen. He was involved in the peace process in the very beginning, and he not only showed himself to be knowledgeable about Irish history and Irish-British relationships, but also he was very sympathetic to the idea of resolving conflict.''' ,'''I would have felt ashamed if I had not been part of the resistance and part of fighting back against the forces of the state.''' ,'''I carry out my full duties as Deputy First Minister and accept I have tinnitus but appreciate the hearing that I do have and that it does not limit me in a professional or personal capacity.''' ,'''There are some discussions taking place in the United Arab Emirates about the prospects of a long-haul flight into Belfast.''' ,'''I believe a united Ireland is inevitable. I have never put a date on it.''' ,'''We all have a responsibility to advance the process of reconciliation, and as a political leader, I am committed to leading from the front and to continue to take bold and significant steps.''' ,'''We have to govern by treating every single citizen equally.''' ,'''I'm not going to be reduced to the position of being the implementer of Tory cuts in the North.''' ,'''I am very proud I was part of the IRA in Derry and involved in repelling the designs of the British state forces against people who were being treated as second- and third-class citizens.''' ,'''If there is a vote in Britain to leave the E.U. there is a democratic imperative to provide Irish citizens with the right to vote in a border poll to end partition and retain a role in the E.U.''' ,'''I never panic when I get a wasp at my ear. As soon as you strike out, they'll sting you. So just stay cool.''' ,'''I don't know what caused my tinnitus, but I started to become aware of a very low ringing noise in my right ear, which is now constantly there.''' ,'''The last thing we want to see, given the success of the peace process, is the return of installations along the Irish border.''' ,'''Let's leave beside them in another pile all the injustices which exist in the northern state.''' ,'''Let everyone leave all the guns - British guns and Irish guns - outside the door.''' ,'''I am very sure of the ground I stand on. I am also very sure that it is the path shared by republicans across this island genuinely interested in building a new agreed Ireland: republicans who put Ireland before ego, criminality, and self-gain.''' ,'''I do not think we can dismiss the contribution that people make, particularly when it is a very dangerous occupation to be involved in building support for the peace process.''' ,'''I come from a very sporting family and played many sports as a lad.''' ,'''I'm still an Irish republican; I absolutely believe in Irish unity and am working to achieve that. But over the course of 15 years or more, people like myself and others have been working to end the vicious cycle of conflict.''' ,'''Whenever people reach out the hand of friendship towards me, I am not going to refuse that hand.''' ,'''Remembering the loss of those Irishmen from all parts of the island who were sent to their deaths in the imperialist slaughter of the First World War is crucial to understanding our history. It is also important to recognise the special significance in which the Battle of the Somme and the First World War is held.''' ,'''They were two very religious people. My father was a foundry worker and was a daily Mass attender, as was my mother.''' ,'''As a former member of the IRA, I accept all the responsibilities that are due to me. But in terms of the individual circumstances, I don't comment on that.''' ,'''Sinn Fein is an Irish Republican party. We stood in the Assembly election to deliver a prosperous economy and jobs, to protect and enhance public services, support those most in need, and to progress Irish Unity.''' ,]
