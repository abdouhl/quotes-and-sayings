- All the difficulties surrounding the making of 'Mars et Avril' actually fueled its creativity and contributed to its international success!
- 'Mars et Avril' is a science fiction film. It's set in Montreal some 50 years in the future. No one had done that kind of movie in Quebec before because it's expensive, it's set in the future, and it's got tons of visual effects, and it's shot on green screen.
- I made a film that was impossible to make, but I didn't know it was impossible, and that's how I was able to do it.
- Problems are hidden opportunities, and constraints can actually boost creativity.
- When American producers see my film, they think that I had a big budget to do it, like 23 million. But in fact I had 10 percent of that budget. I did 'Mars et Avril' for only 2.3 million.
- If people tell you it's impossible, it's an even better reason to want to do it. People have a tendency to see the problem rather than the final result. If you treat the problems as possibilities, life will start to dance with you in the most amazing ways.
- When you're facing an investor or the institutions or a distributor, it's you yourself with your own ideas and your own project.
- Even if somebody in your family is successful, it doesn't change anything. On the contrary, I suppose people expect more of you in certain ways.
