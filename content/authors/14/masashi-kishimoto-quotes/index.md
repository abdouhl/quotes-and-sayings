quotes = ['''I didn't think much about foreign readers when I began 'Naruto,' but I knew that many of the artists who influenced me had already been accepted overseas.''' ,'''I like the way Quentin Tarantino creates a scene using a series of close-ups or showing very cool images of a person or people walking on some ordinary street in slow motion. I wish I could achieve that kind of slow-motion effect in manga, but it's rather difficult to draw; the only things we can play with are tones of black and white.''' ,'''I watch a lot of movies, and I tend to be influenced by scenes that intrigue me, that make me want to use the same effects or technique.''' ,'''Perfect heroes are cool, but no one can really empathize or identify with them.''' ,'''Exaggeration can lend action scenes more force, but I like to stick to more realistic figures: They help keep the cool in the action scenes, although they may be not as forceful as the exaggerated ones.''' ,]
