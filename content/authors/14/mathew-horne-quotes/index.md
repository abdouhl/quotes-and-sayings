- My upbringing was very basic working-class on the outskirts of Nottingham. My mother, Glenis, was a nursery nurse, looking after special-needs children, and my father, Brian, became the manager of a lace factory after working his way up as an apprentice.
- The first time I ever met posh people was when I went to Manchester University to study drama, but I couldn't care less about people's backgrounds - it's all down to the individual.
- I see clothes as an art form, and also a statement: no matter how vociferously people protest that they don't care what they wear, they sort of have to.
- I wouldn't want to be a part of something that has gone off the boil a bit and isn't as good as the last series. I have confidence enough in my own ability to go on and do something else.
- I always plan what I'm going to wear, although I hope my clothes say that I look really good and I've not thought about it! Ironing is part of the preparation, so I don't mind it.
- Whenever I am not filming and not required to travel with work, I spend all my downtime in Scotland.
- I wanted to be a prosthetic makeup artist after watching 'A Nightmare On Elm Street'.
- I always wanted to be an actor. I did drama at Manchester University and then had a stand-up comedy double act with a guy called Bruce MacKinnon.
- A dressing room is both a personal space and a workspace. It changes with the flick of a switch: turn on the relay - the speaker linked to microphones in the auditorium - and you're at work; when that's off, it's your sanctuary.
- I was nine when I started getting laughs in a school comedy sketch one day, and acting became all I wanted to do. I'm sure my career choice was difficult for my parents: they would have had the usual parental neurosis about how tumultuous the business can be, with lots of actors out of work.
- There have been a lot of strong women who have had a huge influence on my career. I'm working with Imelda Staunton at the moment and she's definitely one of those women. And I would include Kathy Burke, Alison Steadman, Kylie Minogue and Catherine Tate as well.
- I wore a dress as a child for six months and I wouldn't take it off. I was three. I've seen the pictures.
- I've always been a clothes horse, and I spend a lot of money on designers.
- I go to bed at 9.30pm and listen to Radio 4.
- I'm quite ritualistic about my preparation. I always shower before a show, even if I had one before leaving my flat.
- I find it ever so archaic, chanting, but I can see why people do it. I love seeing people getting all their frustrations out for the week.
- I feel most relaxed when I am acting or writing.
- I played in goal for Notts County juniors. I liked that sense that goalkeepers were outsiders, mavericks. But I stopped when I realised I wasn't going to grow any more. I'm 5ft 7ins so I couldn't have been a professional.
- Jealousy isn't something I do. I am not a jealous person.
- If I wake up after eight hours it's right; after nine I'm groggy.
- I can't remember a Christmas where I didn't have a rotten cold, and I always get one about two weeks into a job. I definitely get man flu - I'm not brave at all.
- TV's so quick. You make a choice and you do it, and if the director thinks that's wrong then you make another choice and you do it, and that's it.
- A sketch show by its very nature is hit and miss.
- My dad's a lifelong Notts County fan, but it didn't cross my mind to support his team, and I still feel bad about it. I'm a Tottenham fan because of a 1986 Panini sticker album.
- I won't leave the house without having a shower and, as much as it makes me a terrible anti-conservationist, I often have two a day.
- I go to the gym four times a week and play football about twice a week. I'm pretty active.
- I would go to Hollywood if something came in that I really wanted to do.
- My first relationship at 15 made me really, really mature because it was so destructive and intense. We were inseparable for three years and I was completely and utterly besotted. But then it all fell apart and it took me a long time to get over it.
- When I was about 24, I went to Reykjavik with Benedict Cumberbatch for a few days. We took a three-hour coach ride to a glacier and raced on snowmobiles at 60mph.
- Most dressing rooms are sterile and they feel like someone else's space. But over two weeks of previews, before the show officially opens, they transform - filling up with cards, flowers, home comforts.
- I am not really a fan of beaches or lying by swimming pools, and as I have quite sensitive skin, the sun is my enemy.
- Budapest was very beautiful and spending the day under a canopy of Hungarian trees, on horseback, was fantastic.
- Elves, Eskimos and aliens are the type of girls I am attracted to. I've been going out with my current girlfriend for a year. She looks like a cross between an elf, an Eskimo and an alien, with a bowl haircut and little thin legs.
- No, I'm far too selfish to have a child. Also, I couldn't bear to have an ugly child. I'd have to be 100 per cent sure that the girl I had a child with was good-looking. You can never tell because you don't know what's going on while it's being fermented. You'd have to do a lot of research to check that they didn't have ugly genes.
