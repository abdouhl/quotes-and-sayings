She is just a star. I can see.''' ,'''My kids, they take a lot from me and I always come from an intellectual place. Like intellectually, not emotionally, and most people come from an emotional place and it's unfortunate.''' ,'''The thing with R Kelly was, he liked to record late at night, around midnight.

My personality is how do I buy a hospital? And that has nothing to do with stage. That has to do with the entrepreneurial inside of me.''' ,'''See, I would never have Beyonce up here public speaking. She's not good at it. Solange was just at Yale. She's incredible at it.''' ,'''I've been an educator all my life pretty much. It's important as a manager and also as a record label, to educate your artists on public speaking, how to build that connection, how to communicate effectively, to have a general working knowledge of the music industry.''' ,'''We as label executives, we have to know the limitations of the artists.''' ,'''I guess I kind of have been known as the guy that shakes up girl groups.''' ,'''Every one of us have been disappointed before and have had to go through the grieving process of anger and, you know, disappointment and then acceptance and forgiveness.''' ,'''Business is business and family is family.''' ,'''I would describe my relationship with my daughters as 'loving.'''' ,'''My father was a truck driver, made $50 a week.

Later I found out that she wasn't, and she was actually very much in-tune with her Blackness.''' ,'''Only a fool manages himself.''' ,'''Beyonce did an incredible job of differentiating the sound of Destiny's Child in her songs. When you hear Destiny's Child, you know it based on the harmonies and the melodies.''' ,'''At University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, I was one of the first Blacks there. I didn't go to a Black school until my junior year of college, when I went to Fisk University.''' ,'''It's a lot of stress being a manager - a lot of moving parts.''' ,'''The decision for Beyonce and Music World Entertainment to part was mutual. We did great things together, and I know that she will continue to conquer new territories in music and entertainment.''' ,'''What I'm really proud of Beyonce and Solange, they understand the importance of creating the narrative. It's all about the narrative and how you position yourself with your narrative.''' ,'''Kids watch their parents, right? And when kids are three, four, five-years-old, that's when they're like a sponge, and who they are is really developed by the time they are seven.''' ,'''I'm a little bit more proud of Solange. She chose to do it her way. Because in the beginning, we wanted to mold her into this pop star, and that is not who she is. And we were wrong. I was wrong, the record labels were wrong... She wanted to do it her own way, and she did.''' ,'''When I was growing up, my mother used to say, 'Don't ever bring no nappy-head Black girl to my house.' In the deep South in the '50s, '60s and '70s, the shade of your Blackness was considered important. So I, unfortunately, grew up hearing that message.''' ,'''I only do things that I'm passionate about.''' ,'''As a father I am extremely proud of Beyonce.
