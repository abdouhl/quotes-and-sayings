- I'm really bad at memorizing, so that's one of my big struggles in an audition setting, with the lines.
- I want someone that I can have fun with and laugh with. I love to laugh, and I'm really sarcastic, so it's important that she can take a joke. I think if you are going to be with someone for a while, you really need someone you can let loose with and let go of all the stress of the day.
