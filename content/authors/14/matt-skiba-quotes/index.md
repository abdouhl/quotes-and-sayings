- The very first show I ever saw was The Judds, and that influenced me to not play country music.
- I think that the more that you play and the more instruments you play and the better you get at them, then you will be better off for it as a guitarist.
- A cousin of mine was a graphic designer, and he took me as a kid to see Flesh for Lulu and Social Distortion in 1988 in Chicago.
- It's never been about what we want others to see: it's about what we want to see; it's about what we want to do. We only have a career because of our fans, but we have to keep making music for the reason we started making music.
- I consider myself a pagan and a witch.
- I think who I am as a person on and off the stage is always kind of the same thing, but I don't take a lot of things very seriously.
- I love being in Blink!
- When I agreed to do the Blink shows, I said that I'd do it as long as they were willing to practise every day.
- As a kid, I took piano lessons, and I didn't like it. It wasn't cool. I was into Duran Duran and rock music. I didn't have any interest in piano. I did it for three years, and because of piano, I learned percussion. I learned scales. I learned how to sing. Piano gives you all of the basics of those things.
- I grew up on Michael Jackson, Pat Benetar, and Van Halen - all the things coming out of the television.
- I really like a lot of the old 2-tone ska. I definitely went through a phase where I was into The Specials and The Busters. But a lot of the ska revival - I never really have had an interest in that.
- Being a drummer definitely influences how I play guitar. And then piano influences drumming and vice versa.
- We definitely like to write songs about darker things, but we like to think of it as a celebration of the evil ideas that run through everybody's head.
- People think we're always dark and gloomy, and we're not.
- The Sekrets record is very much me, and Dan's Emergency Room is very much him. And then Alkaline Trio is very much ours.
- I'm a bookworm, so I read about a book a month.
- Creating a record on my own and deciding who plays and how the songs were structured, it was fun to do.
- I've been to the Bahamas before, and it's so crass. You land in Nassau, and the whole island is replete with beauty and culture, but there's a lot of poverty. It is a largely black population; then they build these places like Atlantis and The Cove that are walled off.
- With Alkaline Trio, we are who we are. We never really feel too confined, but when we get together, there is an Alkaline Trio sound, and when I go off and do something on my own, there is an element of freedom that I don't have with the Trio.
- I want recording to be fun.
- I go with what I know and what I see, and I believe in reality.
- Death isn't something that should necessarily be glorified, but I also don't think it's something that people need to be afraid of. It's just the way it is. There's nothing we can do about it.
- I'm in Alkaline Trio; I guess I get to rip off myself. I give myself permission.
- My attraction to the Church of Satan... is the same thing that initially attracted me to punk rock. It was something that wasn't very entirely popular, and it was sort of like the adversary to mainstream culture and beliefs.
- There was some real bad alternative - 'alternative' - stuff that came out in the '90s that's completely cringe-worthy.
- Glasgow is one of my favourite cities.
- I miss the videos that are short films, back when MTV played videos all day.
- When you're 20, you think you know a lot more than you do.
- Fear is sort of like jealousy. It's an unnecessary emotion.
- The really smart conspiracies are the ones that explain, 'This is why this is plausible,' not, 'This is what happened.' If it makes sense and if it's possible, I'd investigate it.
- All of my HH Jags have Ducati stickers on 'em.
- I honestly couldn't have asked for or expected the amount of love and support I've received from a large majority of Blink's fans.
- The first line of the song is always the hardest thing to write. And then after that, the song should - unless it sucks - it should write itself.
- I like even numbers.
- We've had kids come to our shows and ask us why we hate Jesus. It's like, 'Well, we don't hate Jesus at all. We just think religion is silly, and it's a really popular thing, but that doesn't mean we have to agree with it.'
- I went through some pretty rough patches in my life, and I've come out of them a stronger, more inspired, and energetic person.
- I collect motorcycles and art.
- It feels really good to be doing Blink justice. Stepping on stage for the first show was pretty crazy. I've been skydiving several times, and that's the closest thing I can compare it to. Such a beautiful rush.
- I first heard of Ulver reading the 'Lords of Chaos' book.
- My parents have always been very supportive. But now that I play in Blink, all of my parents' friends are so jazzed that it makes my folks excited.
- There are things about this country that are horrible; there's things about this country that are beautiful. I've been almost everywhere, and there's nowhere else I'd rather live.
- The Ramones all hate each other, and they did it for decades. I wouldn't be able to do that. That would be like working at the bank or something.
- Pennywise are legends and gentlemen and maniacs.
- Making your band your career just seems like a pipe dream when it's not happening, and when it does, it seems so surreal.
- With every inch of my energy, I wanted Fyre not to happen. I put all the electricity and energy in my body against that thing happening.
- To be in touch with death, and the darker side of life, makes the lighter side more enjoyable.
- I've done some stuff with Glenn Danzig before, and while I can't really say that we're friends, we're friendly acquaintances.
- I grew up on Edgar Allen Poe, and I loved Alfred Hitchcock's movies.
- I think people hear the words 'transcendental meditation' and 'paganism,' and that's almost worse because it's real. Those are real things. Those are absolute energies. Satanism is like Halloween. Transcendental meditation and having a realization of how we really are - whether we want to be or not - we live in a pagan culture.
- The Devil is fun.
- Orange County encompasses a large area that has a lot of Alkaline Trio fans.
- My parents are both war veterans; they met in Vietnam. They were involved in a war that they absolutely disagreed with.

- I don't personally feel that I've lost my fire.
- They are one of my favorite bands and one of my first musical loves: Devo.
- Never had a mullet.

- I loved anything spooky, mysterious, or frightening.
- I have never played in a ska band.
- I was a bicycle messenger when Alkaline Trio was formed as a way to make ends meet before the band became a career, and I've just always been a cyclist - I BMX'd, and then I got really into - through messengering - I got really into road bikes and fixed gears, which I still have.
- Heaven and hell are something that people create to make some people feel guilty and other people like myself laugh.
- We have the best fans in the world. A lot of artists say that, but in this case, it's actually fact.
- Jesus was not born on December 25th. There's carbon evidence of it. That freaks people out.
- I don't think we're any more preoccupied by life and death or heaven and hell than anyone else, but it's fun to write about the inevitable - you're alive, and you're going to die.
- There is sort of an unspoken 'no skateboarding' clause on tour that I break pretty often.
- Rock n' roll is the Devil's music.

- I feel like everything happens for a reason.
- They're great players. I'm not a Blues Traveler fan, though. I get it, but it's not for me.
- Dallas is a good town. I spent a lot of time there as a kid. It always nice to come back.
- I think I'm a man about the things I need to be a man about, but I get paid to play, pretty much. I do what I love for a living, and I also get to build BMX bikes in my spare time.
- I'm from the MTV generation.
- We certainly are proud of our punk-rock heritage, but when people who like other kinds of music are into your band, it's flattering.
- To worship the devil, you have to believe in it first.
- At an early age I told myself I would never quit skating; I would never quit riding BMX and being a motorcycle junkie. I just can't stop doing those things.
- When George W. Bush was up for re-election, we took part in Rock Against Bush.
- I see kids in Cradle of Filth shirts at our shows, which is awesome.
- As far as, like, the moon landing... did we go there? I believe so. Is it everything that we're told? I don't think so.
- I think for us - and for a lot of people in the Church of Satan - we definitely like ruffling people's feathers and poking fun at organized religion a little bit.
- I'm the die-hard that still goes out to buy records.

- Meditation has really done wonders for me personally and artistically.
- Touring with Blink helped introduce people to Alkaline Trio who otherwise wouldn't have ever heard of us.

- Being on Epic, it wasn't like we got signed to a multi-million-dollar deal.
- We have this song called 'Radio,' and I wrote that song when we needed one more song for a record. So I went back into the other room and wrote it in 20 minutes.
- For me, it's about eating a bunch of fruit and exercising, which opens up the creativity, makes it easier to give ideas a chance and bubble to the surface. I'm no angel, but it helps me, as does hiking, heading to the ocean to catch some waves - for me, sweating it out is definitely good for the creative process.
