- Though some choices may slow our journey, every path we take gives us more familiarity with how our actions affect the world around us, giving us more opportunities to learn how to help ourselves and others.
- I write little quotes all the time to help encourage people to come together, like this one: 'If fate happens to toss you a lightbulb, use it to light the path of others, for they will use theirs to light the path of you. With your light together with mine, it's two times as bright and twice as strong.'
- I've always lived by the ocean, and I always will. There's nothing like taking a walk and being able to smell the ocean breeze.
- 'The Office' is clearly the funniest show on TV. But I can't live without watching 'Eureka.' It's my favorite show of all time, and I watch it constantly on my iPod.
- Life is full of confusion. Confusion of love, passion, and romance. Confusion of family and friends. Confusion with life itself. What path we take, what turns we make. How we roll our dice.
