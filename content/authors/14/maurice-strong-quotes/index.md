quotes = ['''Inertia is a powerful force in human and political affairs.''' ,'''Most of my supporters are people who actually know me.

It adds up.''' ,'''Nevertheless, the concept of sustainable development is now known - even amongst those who haven't accepted it - and it's recognized, debated and followed by an increasing number of businesses.''' ,'''One of the things that I've always thought I would like to do is to develop an environmental index. Then people can measure their own environmental performance on an index as they do in other ways.''' ,'''We're either going to save Ihe world or no one will be saved.''' ,'''I am on the board of corporations who contribute both to environmental problems and their solutions.

We have the inertia of past habits, unsustainable habits.''' ,'''Don't accept that you can't make a difference. Because if you can't make a difference, you won't make a difference, and if you put a multiplier on that we will continue on an unsustainable pathway.''' ,'''We in the industrialized world make a greater difference because our ecological footprint, our impact on the condition of the environment, is 40 to 50 times larger than that of people in the developing world.''' ,'''Licences to have babies incidentally is something that I got in trouble for some years ago for suggesting even in Canada that this might be necessary at some point, at least some restriction on the right to have a child.''' ,'''What pleases me most is that sustainable development is on almost everybody's agenda now.''' ,'''Toyota was the first to put a commercial fuel cell powered car on the road, and I have no doubt that Toyota will continue to be in the front lines in the development of competitive fuel cell vehicles.''' ,'''Not to say that corporations are perfect today, but even grand corporations like Dupont have made immense progress in translating some of their past environmentally damaging practices into new profit opportunities.''' ,'''A shift is necessary toward lifestyles less geared to environmental damaging consumption patterns.''' ,'''Anyone who is seriously interested in me would usually do a little more homework and realise that the extreme criticisms are almost exclusively ideologically based.''' ,'''We owe at least this much to future generations, from whom we have borrowed a fragile planet called Earth.''' ,'''I've always made it clear that I do not believe that global government is either necessary or feasible.''' ,'''I am President of the UN created University for Peace, which has a strong commitment to the relationship between peace, security and the environment. I meet with young people around the world and I always come away enthused and encouraged.''' ,'''I am retired from all my official roles, but I am still very active. I have close relationships at the U.N. I don't have any role at the U.N, but I'm still quite cooperative with a number of U.N. activities, in particular to China and that region.''' ,'''If you want to maintain a sustainable supply of fish you have to farm the fish, rather than mine them. So putting your money into fishing fleets that are going to exacerbate the problem by over-fishing is not the way to preserve the underlying asset.''' ,'''Also, it is interesting that developing countries, with China and India perhaps in the lead, where the future of the global environment will be decided are now on board with the case for sustainable development.''' ,'''I've got used to criticisms and, naturally, I try to make sure I don't listen to the more extreme ones because most of the people who have taken their right-wing extremist view of my life are people that I've never met.''' ,'''I believe we are going to move into a situation where the more effective conferences will be smaller, more specialized, more focused, with occasional large gatherings to get the attention of the larger world.''' ,'''The combination of population growth and the growth in consumption is a danger that we are not prepared for and something we will need global co-operation on.''' ,'''Ted Turner is still a leader. And he sets a great example. His ability financially has been reduced, but his influence and his example still is an important asset to the whole environmental movement.''' ,'''I learn something from criticism because when it comes from sources you respect you always examine it and learn.''' ,'''My son is the main shareholder of my company, and I help him explore some of those opportunities that are related to things I know about, such as energy and the environment.

There may not be another chance.''' ,'''I've developed a huge regard for Toyota for its environmental awareness, for its immense commitment to research and development in this field, and for its leadership in developing hybrids which others are now following.''' ,'''After all, sustainability means running the global environment - Earth Inc. - like a corporation: with depreciation, amortization and maintenance accounts. In other words, keeping the asset whole, rather than undermining your natural capital.''' ,'''Rumors of my wealth are greatly exaggerated. I have never been interested in money.''' ,]
