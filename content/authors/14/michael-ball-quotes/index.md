- I do all the cooking at home and love it.
- That's what distinguishes the pros from people involved in amateur theatre. You just go out and do it again and again.
- I need to have a sleep before a show and a quiet hour. I need to get dressed following the same routine. And I like to smell right for a show.
- When I was 19 and at drama school, a couple of friends and I decided to drive from Guildford through France, down to the heel of Italy and then take a ferry to Greece - in an MG Midget. On our second day, in France, we were in a very bad accident and wrote off the car so we had to go home. But we then flew out instead and went island hopping.
- In 2005, I played Count Fosco in 'The Woman In White' on Broadway. It was a disaster. I was physically run down and terribly homesick and I just knew I had to leave. I lasted three months before the producers released me.
- Working every day isn't hard if you love what you're doing.
- You can generate a phenomenal relationship with an audience. It's very gratifying, a real privilege.
- I sometimes feel I want to release an album without people knowing it is me.
- I will always tour, it's hard work it really is hard work, but the feedback and the buzz you get back from it is worth it.
- Musicals allow a depth of emotion that you don't get in another form of acting, the chord changes, the lyrics really affect people, so that in two hours, you've forgotten about things.
- I play roles, but when I'm off stage, I always try to be myself.
- How many millions of times have I sung 'Love Changes Everything?' But when I see how it matters to people, it gives me the impetus to rediscover it and remember how lucky I am to have a song like that.
- I had Steven Spielberg on my radio show.
- You will never, ever catch me at the gym.
- Music is music and there are only two types: good and bad.
- When I was starting, I was working with actors who came up through the rep system, and they understood the discipline required: you were never late for rehearsal, you were never not ready to go on, you were always prepared; it was about showing respect to the rest of the company.
- I was very close to my grandmother, Agnes Parry. She was a typical matriarchal leader of the family and the community. People looked up to her and would always go to her for advice and help.
- The one I really get on with is Princess Anne. Talk about calls a spade a shovel! And she's so clued-up. She's a patron of a number of charities. I've been involved in a couple and she's not just a name. She knows the research programmes that are going on. She really does her homework.
- We're so stuck in our heads with social media that we don't get to meet people and go out to have a joint experience unless we go to a live event, like the theatre.
- You can't make a star - they just have it.
- As a performer, once you've understood the genre of musical theatre, you can tire very quickly of the two-dimensional stuff. With Sondheim, it's always a challenge. It's difficult and exhilarating and he's so good on the complexities of relationships and on things going wrong.
- Country songs are theatrical songs, they tell stories, and wear the hearts on their sleeves and they have great melodies.
- You have to be on your game with a live audience because anything can change.
- I adore Dartmoor, where I grew up, and the Cotswolds are amazing.

- People will assume what a record is going to be like and they are loath to even give it a listen.

- I've never been fashionable, so I'll never be out of fashion.
- That's the only show where, if anyone says to me, 'Is there a role you want to play?', I say, yeah, I want to play Sweeney Todd. Stephen Sondheim's so clever; it's a profoundly brilliant piece of work.
- Working is learning.
- I love my fans and they follow me everywhere - I recognise a lot of faces.
- I never thought of myself as a particularly controversial figure.
- The biggest myth I'd like to bust isn't about me - it's about musicals. So many people dismiss the entire art form through highbrow snobbery, but I think a lot of those people would be suprised if they actually saw some.
- I'm really superstitious.
- Theatres, stages are dangerous places.
- What does annoy me is when critics use me to ridicule my audience. All the stuff about 'Tesco housewives' and 'the blue-rinse brigade.'
- Ah, 'Kismet,' or Carry On Camel, as we called it. I thought the show was shocking. It was the worst designed production ever but it's got a fantastic score. It's not an awfully good book though. You really have to work hard to eke out any laughs from that script.
- It is as polar opposite as it comes for the man who was Edna Turnblad in 'Hairspray' to come back as Sweeney Todd.

- As a person, Stephen Sondheim is a very funny, very dry and very shy man. I've never witnessed any diva-ish moments, he just always seems so thrilled people are doing his work.
- It's a mantra I've lived by for as long as I can remember. Nothing lasts for ever.
- We've all sort of been there: It's coming on Christmas, all that preparation is going on, and you just want to escape. You don't want to buy into it. It's a time of year that brings up a lot of memories for people, and if you're missing somebody, it's hardest at this time of year.
- I send a text every day to my partner Cath, saying 'I love you.'
- The first time I encountered Stephen Sondheim was like everyone else: through snatches of old songs people performed in drama school, through 'Send in the Clowns,' which everyone knew. I wasn't aware at the time that he was the writing force behind 'West Side Story' and 'Gypsy.'
- No-one has ever sung quite so beautifully as Karen Carpenter.
- I got involved in the Surrey Country youth theatre which led me to go to drama school where I realised that this was going to have to be my career, and I was really lucky to get big breaks early on.

- I love doing characters that surprise people and showing what I am, which is an actor, first and foremost.
- I'm not a big fan of Christmas, and I think there are a lot of people who feel a bit melancholy at the holiday.
- You can't ever make assumptions about a family tree.
- I absolutely love 'Big Brother' and 'Celebrity Big Brother' and have never missed a series - but I would never appear on them.
- I used to bottle things up.
- I had no idea what I was going to do with my life. But then a lady at the youth theatre asked me if I'd ever thought of going to drama school.
- You can't get down and dirty at the opera.
- I just work so much and so hard that I love the idea of being around family, friends and my animals quietly at home, just chilling out.
- I love the idea of being on stage and people thinking they know who Michael Ball is, they've got an image and then not knowing and going: who's that? I mean, that's the best compliment ever.
- The only thing I won't eat is swede - I can't bear it.

- There's something about the security and warmth of knowing that one person who, whatever happens, will always be on your side.
- Tapping therapy is absolutely brilliant. Stephen Gately from Boyzone, God rest his soul, told me about it. It's just a little tap that focuses the mind away from that wave of panic and adrenalin that shoots into your body.
- I think shows like 'Dancing on Ice,' 'X Factor' and 'Britain's Got Talent' make great telly, but I'd never want to be contestant. I'm far too insecure and competitive. Also, working in theatre, you're being judged all the time - and I'd rather not be told I'm awful in front of millions of people!
- I have far ascended beyond every ambition my 16-year-old self ever had.
- Anyone who's suffered from panic attacks knows how frightening they are.

- Wilbur Smith's novels make terrific holiday reading.
- I don't think you last very well in this business if you're trendy because trends come and go.

- I can't properly explain it, but I don't mind admitting I suffered a breakdown.
- I'd always had this hankering to try some opera.
- I don't have hobbies. Other than watching telly and walking my dogs, what I do is work. That's who I am.
- I saw 'Hairspray' in New York and had one of the best nights I've ever had in the theatre.
- When you're on stage and the stars are aligned and the audience is as one and you're guiding them, steering them... It's a feeling of incredible potency, of unity, of such, such joy. It's almost overwhelming to know that you're making that number of people feel better.
- Legally we have integration, social acceptance and diversity... but that doesn't mean... everybody is down with it.
- I've recorded a few Bacharach songs over the years and performed some in concert and always felt they suited me.
- I'd rather take the mick out of myself before anyone else does. I know they'll do it, so I'd rather get in there first!
- Bacharach has such a brilliant ear for melody and his music has a completely timeless feel to it; I thought it would be great to do a whole album of his music and to record with a full orchestra and big band which is something I hadn't done before.
- This was a seminal moment in my life - my dad took me to see the original production of 'Jesus Christ Superstar' at the Palace Theatre in 1973. I thought it was just amazing, so powerful. The idea of using rock music to tell the story of Jesus was incredible.
- Try to leave people feeling better for having met you.
- I love a drink. But I've never, ever in my life been on a stage and done a performance with an alcoholic drink inside me. Never have, never would. I've seen people who do and invariably they're never as good as they think they are.
- You must never ask or expect anyone to do anything that you would not be prepared to do yourself.
- Les Mis' was an amazing experience, to be in the original cast of 'Les Miserables,' and 'Chitty Chitty Bang Bang' God bless it that was fantastic, at the London Palladium the biggest theatre in London the most successful show that has ever been at the London Palladium, that was fantastic.
- For the millennium, we flew to Kuala Lumpur and then on to Pangkor Laut, a nearby island.
- I spent my 40th birthday on the stage of the Palladium in 'Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.'
