- It has been a difficult road this year, but still I look at every day as a new opportunity.
- I realize that I'm in the twilight of my career.
- I think the French Open, in many ways, brought out a certain characteristic in me and in my game that was already there. Just the circumstances allowed for it to be able to show.
- That's what really seems to be the more difficult aspect - to have the men break through and challenge the best players in the world.
- I didn't have the ability to blow people off the court, so I needed my legs, my preparation and the ability to think on my feet.
- I feel like I have as good a shot as anybody out there and I have gotten close in the past, so why not have the attitude that I can come out and play great tennis and maybe even win this tournament.
- I think I could look back through the past few years at missed opportunities and stuff, but one thing I have learned is not to dwell on missed chances or times where you have failed.
- I have lost a little bit of flexibility, but the doctors say with any kind of torn ligament it is not uncommon for the injury to take 16 months to be 100 percent healed.
- You can work really hard, but if you're not training in the right way you're not going to improve and get to the level that you want to.

- For me, at the French Open, if I wasn't playing my match I was glued to CNN watching the events unfold.
- I was always really strict on myself about doing everything possible to prepare for competition.
- I just feel like it would be so against my personality to have this struggle in tennis and just give up. I know it's not me, not who I am, and that would probably affect other parts of my life.
- I am just trying to get biblically stronger.
- Obviously the Asian American community wants you to do well. They are cheering you on no matter what the circumstances.
- I still have a belief and a faith that some great things are still going to happen in my career. If I didn't believe that, it makes no sense for me to be out there, and on top of that, I know this is a period of time that God wants me to persevere through.
- It's like one of those dreams you have when someone is chasing you. You're running as fast as you can, and someone's trotting behind you, just out of range, trying to grab onto you.
- I look at tennis as a bit of a platform to hopefully touch lives and encourage people.
- As an athlete, I used my speed, agility and quickness to go out and play against the big guys.
- My knee feels good right now. I am definitely able to move about whichever way.
- In the tennis world, there weren't a whole lot of Asians playing. You see it a little bit more now. The same can really be said for basketball.
- I think when you've played at the level that I've played, anything outside the top 10 in certain aspects is just a number, unless you're obviously trying to get into tournaments and stuff.
- It's difficult sometimes when you have somebody who is of a different culture trying to make light of something that is maybe not quite something that they understand.
- Maybe sometimes I'm such a thinker, I reevaluate too much. Sometimes when it comes down to it, I really don't need to do anything, I don't really need to change anything. I need to just keep plugging away, working at it.
- As long as there's pasta and Chinese food in the world, I'm okay.
