- Adopting means opening your home, and heart, to a life you've never known. But there is nothing as richly rewarding as being an adoptive parent.
- I don't want to have anyone else as Prime Minister other than David Cameron, and if people spend their time thinking about some of this stuff, then they are getting in the way of two things: one, a fair, open, fact-based referendum debate; and two, the Conservative government continuing afterwards in a stable and secure fashion.

- I think it's time that we said to people who are incapable of acknowledging that they've ever got anything wrong: 'I'm sorry, you've had your day.' Unelected, unaccountable elites, I'm afraid it's time to say, 'You're fired. We are going to take back control.'
- I can't foretell the future, but I don't believe that the act of leaving the European Union would make our economic position worse; I think it would make it better.
- It's the invincible arrogance of Europe's elites that gets me. These are people who have seen the euro collapse. These are people who are presiding over a migration crisis on their borders, and yet do they ever acknowledge that they need to change? No. They say they need more integration, more of our money, more control over this country.

- I'm not interested in defending the position of those who already have money, power and privilege.
- The economic basis on which Nicola Sturgeon and the Scottish nationalists made the case for separation was based on an oil price much higher than it is at the moment, so there will be no case for it.
- In my view, our immigration policy means that we have some people who can come into this country - who we might want to say no to - and others, who we might want to attract, who can't currently come in.
- If we, in the future, have confidence in ourselves, then there's no limit to what we can achieve, and I think the depressing litany... that we hear from the Remain side is not the type of approach we should take into the future.
- Were I ever alone in the dock, I would not want to be arraigned before our flawed tribunals, knowing my freedom could be forfeit as a result of political pressures. I would prefer a fair trial, under the shadow of the noose.

- I will do exactly as the Prime Minister asks me.
- As long as there are people in education making excuses for failure, cursing future generations with a culture of low expectations, denying children access to the best that has been thought and written, because Nemo and the Mister Men are more relevant, the battle needs to be joined.
- Our security and sovereignty stand together.
- You know you don't see hospital consultants going on strike, and I don't believe that teachers and head teachers should. It's within their rights, it's a civil right, but I think it is wrong in terms of the reputation of the profession.

- Democratic self-government has manifestly brought benefits to India, Japan, Norway, Switzerland, South Africa, South Korea, and scores of nations all making their way in the world.

We will have control over our own laws, and as a result, we will be able to deal with whatever the world throws at us.

- What we're doing now is we're saying that individual schools can spend the money on their own priorities, so that head teachers can decide what's truly important, because the big shift in approach on education that we're taking - which is different from what happened before - is that we trust teachers and we trust heads.
- I was a union member in my youth as well and I went on strike, and I don't think it solved anything. It only made the situation worse for everyone involved.

- Teachers themselves know if there's a colleague who can't keep control or keep the interest of their class, it affects the whole school.
- One of the problems we've had is that the ICT curriculum in the past has been written for a subject that is changing all the time.

- Anyone who's working in manufacturing here should know they will have increased opportunities if we leave the European Union.
- There is no prospect of any of us being able to kick out any of the presidents of Europe; they operate in a sphere and a realm well away from and out of reach of and out of touch with the people.
- My sister and I know our lives could have been different - radically, unthinkably, irretrievably different - if we had not been adopted. We might have found ourselves in homes without love, stability or kindness. We might have found ourselves in care for much longer, without the secure attachment that being cradled in a mother's arms brings.
- When we vote to leave, I think a majority of people in Scotland will also vote to leave as well.
- I prefer to take the view of businesspeople who are actually generating jobs and creating wealth.
- There is a slam-dunk case for extending foreign language teaching to children aged five. Just as some people have taken a perverse pride in not understanding mathematics, so we have taken a perverse pride in the fact that we do not speak foreign languages, and we just need to speak louder in English.
- At the moment, I'm afraid that the discipline system doesn't give teachers the support that they need. One thing that I've been struck by is that the number of violent assaults on teachers increased last year. We need to be clear that teachers have the power they need in order to impose discipline.
- If you vote to leave the E.U.... we will have additional flexibility to help industries who really need it.
- Children in dysfunctional homes at risk of abuse are kept in danger for too long because politically correct rules mean we won't challenge unfit parents.
- Children themselves know they are being cheated. Ultimately we owe it to our children. They are in school for 190 days a year. Every moment they spend learning is precious. If a year goes by and they are not being stretched and excited, that blights their life.

- I can't influence how other parties choose to vote.

- Good schools should be left alone.
- Whether we vote to leave or remain, there are risks to our future; there are challenges in the global economy.
- One thing is undeniable. If we are going to continue to have support for migration, we need to be able to control the numbers.
- The common fisheries policy essentially gave other European Union nations unfettered access to our fish stocks and - I would hope - that if we leave the European Union, we can once more see the ports of Peterborough and Fraserhead and Grimsby flourishing, because we will take back control of our territorial waters.
- Ed Balls keeps saying that we are committed to scrapping the EMA. I have never said this. We won't.
- Hanging may seem barbarous, but the greater barbarity lies in the slow abandonment of our common law traditions.
- I recognise that fishing is perhaps not the most high-employment industry in this country, but it's a symbol of what we lost when we entered the E.U.: control over national resources that, if we retained them, we could have husbanded in our interest and, indeed, in the interest of others.
- I have specifically argued that we need to change our relationship with the European Union by fundamentally reforming not just our relationship but the European Union itself.
- In England, more than in any comparable country, those who are born poor are more likely to stay poor, and those who inherit privilege are more likely to pass on privilege. For those of us who believe in social justice, this stratification and segregation are morally indefensible.

- I think the principal purpose of education is to allow each of us, when we become adults, to shape our own future.
- The decision to trigger Article 50 is in the hands of the next prime minister. If that is me, I will make a judgement as to when is right for Britain, and I won't be hurried or hassled by anyone into pressing that button or triggering that article until I believe it is right for this country.
- I believe that there are better opportunities to keep people safe if we are outside the European Union.
- I absolutely haven't set out to burnish a reputation as a macho figure by picking fights.
- I think, instead of the pessimism of the Remain campaign, we have an opportunity to think of the next generation. If we have faith in their talent, in their generosity, in their hard work, we can, if we leave the E.U., ensure the next generation makes this country once more truly great.
- The First World War may have been a uniquely horrific war, but it was also plainly a just war.
- I want people to concentrate not on my job but on their jobs.
- I believe that the decisions which govern all our lives, the laws we must all obey, and the taxes we must all pay should be decided by people we choose and who we can throw out if we want change.
- It is literally the case that learning languages makes you smarter. The neural networks in the brain strengthen as a result of language learning.
- What I think is wrong is spending £9m of taxpayers' money on one particular piece of one-sided propaganda.
