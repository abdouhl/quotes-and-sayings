quotes = ['''I grew up in the Midwest and had a lot of exposure to big religion. I went to church every Sunday - my mother even sang in the choir - and most families I knew where practicing Christians.''' ,'''I've got an original graphic novel called 'The Indian and the Bandit' that I'm writing with a childhood friend.''' ,'''Most stories in 'True Blood' take place over a short amount of time. I think the entire three seasons of the show have only spanned a month and a half of those characters' lives.''' ,'''One of the greatest things about playing a villain is people wondering when he's going to make his comeback.''' ,'''I'm sort of killing two birds with one stone here, getting to write for 'True Blood' and being able to put myself in a comic at the same time.''' ,'''Co-writing the 'True Blood' comic is a dream come true both as a performer on the show and as longtime comic fan. It's a real privilege to build on the rapidly growing 'True Blood' mythology.''' ,'''When I approached Volume 1 of 'Lucid,' I realized I could tell something that only exists in four issues, or I could roll the dice a bit and approach this as Season 1 of a TV show.''' ,'''I'm hooked on 'Game of Thrones.' I'm a fan of the books and the show.''' ,'''I really want to do a 'True Blood-Six Feet Under' comic book crossover.''' ,'''I remember the first job I ever had was working on 'Firefly,' and I was talking to Joss Whedon, and he was asking if I was going to Comic-Con. He called me a loser for not going that first year.''' ,'''I want to work on the 'True Blood' comic for as long as they'll let me.''' ,]
