- I don't have a favorite photo. As a photographer, I have attachments to each image. Not the one photo: the experience of getting the photos is the challenge or the thing.
- The challenges I face in the studio pale in comparison to when I'm out in nature.
- I don't use cages - I've been surrounded by 150 to 200 sharks, not once ever been close to being bitten.
- Most people catch them breaching from the surface when they're shooting out of the water. I have them breaching from underwater in a 16-time sequence, a shark leaving the water and then reentering the water.
- I had this vision of shooting a great white in the studio with all the edge lights I use for movie posters. I knew that I couldn't bring the great white to the studio, so I had to bring the studio to the great white.
- People don't need to be scared. I tickle sharks. I do, when they swim by.
- Most people don't know that humans kill 100 million sharks every year, mostly for a really expensive soup in Asia.
