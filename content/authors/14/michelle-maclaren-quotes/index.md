- In 'Breaking Bad,' we have a lead character who definitely finds himself in a situation he would never have expected to find himself in normally.
- I did every odd job you could possibly imagine: Holding a sign in the rain for 14 hours straight, sweeping up cigarette butts, pouring coffee, running around - anything I could to be on a film set. I wanted to be in the business. So I'd say, 'You need that job done? Fine,' and I became indispensable to people.
- Would I like to do a feature? Absolutely.
- I'm not surprised that I tend to go for the dark side. I was a really scared kid, so I think I understand what scares people.
- Graphic novels are such a visually creative world - it's really interesting what they can do in one sketch. Now I'm hooked.
- A montage is incredibly challenging. When I can, I'd like to know what the music is going to be ahead of time because that will affect the beat, the pace of the montage.
- I always say that AMC hires filmmakers, and they let them be filmmakers.
- I always say, 'I love producing, but directing is my passion,' and for a while, I had to produce to support my directing habit.
- 'Breaking Bad' was a magical, amazing experience. I'm honored to have been a part of it.
- 'Once Upon a Time in the West' is one of my favorite films.
- Sometimes I forget to say 'cut' because I am so lost in the performance.
- I love television. Television is a great medium; I'm fortunate enough to direct amazing television.
- In general, we like to shoot Breaking Bad like a modern day Western, and Sergio Leone is one of my all-time favorite directors.
- After I directed for the first time, I wanted to call every director I'd ever worked with and apologize. In television you are tasked with shooting 42 minutes, or whatever, in eight days. That's not a lot of time.
- I really want to be part of things from the ground up wherever possible. Not to say that I'm not open to being a gun for hire - I am, absolutely - but I really enjoy developing.
- The type of producing that I did for many years involved working very closely with directors.
- I will never leave television.
- I seem to gravitate toward the dark side of things when it comes to directing. I love action, but I love the drama as well.
- Every character a writer creates has some of themselves in it somewhere.
- I approach an action sequence almost like a mathematical problem. Sometimes you get these action sequences that you read and go, 'Oh my God, this is huge, how do I do it?' and I go, 'Just a step at a time. Sit down and plot each piece of it out.'
- I've been very fortunate to have the opportunity to work on wonderful shows.
- Vince Gilligan and AMC are really wonderful people to direct and produce for because they don't put the demands of any conventionalism on you.
- I love the dark comedy in 'Breaking Bad.'
- My feeling is, from when I started on 'Breaking Bad,' there's no reason to pick and choose because every episode is great. Whatever episode you get, you're lucky to do it.
