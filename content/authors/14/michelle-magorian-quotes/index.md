It wasn't until I was nine years old on a ship returning from Australia that I was introduced to children's books.''' ,'''When my younger son was 13 years old, he asked me to read 'Swallows and Amazons' to him while he made models. He liked it so much that I ended up reading all thirteen of Ransome's books, including the ones that I missed out on.

The Arthur Ransome books gave me an alternative childhood and the tools to escape.''' ,'''At school, if I was ever bored in class, I would draw maps of islands or detailed interior of boats or lists of provisions and equipment I would need when I went camping in the summer.''' ,]
