quotes = ['''When you make an animated film, you make it over and over and over. We almost do ten versions of the film.''' ,'''A big part of directing animation is deciding what you really want to do and making sure it's about something. My favorite thing about animation is the storytelling. You can really dig into the story and spend time with the writers. The writers don't just write and leave.''' ,'''Our Trolls are like gummy bears that have been flocked in velvet, and it's a world made of fiber art... carpeted floors, houses made of hair - even fire is made of hair.''' ,'''The narrative shouldn't stop for the song in a musical. The music has to continue the narrative of the storytelling.''' ,]
