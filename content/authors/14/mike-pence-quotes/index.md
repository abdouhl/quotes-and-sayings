quotes = ['''You know, Hoosiers recognize pork when we see it. And they recognize what bailing out every failing business in America means - We're burying generations under a mountain range of debt.''' ,'''I occasionally got called the Rush Limbaugh of Indiana, but most people knew that my style was different.''' ,'''Fighting for free enterprise means standing up for free markets. The freedom to succeed includes the freedom to fail. We must defend entrepreneurial capitalism against the onslaught of the American Left.''' ,'''I opposed No Child Left Behind, I opposed the Medicare prescription drug bill, I opposed the Wall Street bailout. What the American people are starting to see is that Republican, Republicans on Capitol Hill get it and the Democrats, from the White House to Capitol Hill, just don't get it.''' ,'''The reality is that during the Reagan years, for instance, we doubled the amount of revenue that we were sending to Washington, D.C. after the tax cuts took effect.''' ,'''A campaign ought to demonstrate the basic human decency of the candidate. That means your First Amendment rights end at the tip of your opponent's nose - even in the matter of political rhetoric.''' ,'''I support free trade, and so does Donald Trump.''' ,'''The so-called 'Employee Free Choice Act' envisions a world where workers would be denied privacy and forced to vote in an atmosphere of intimidation.''' ,'''America wins when we trade and export and import.''' ,'''Donald Trump will never turn his back on those who serve and protect us at home and abroad.''' ,'''I believe we need to focus first and foremost - as Donald Trump has done with such force and such passion - on border integrity and building the wall.''' ,'''I opposed the Medicare prescription drug entitlement. I opposed the Wall Street bailout. I opposed the stimulus bill.''' ,'''The most important job I'll ever have is spelled D-A-D.''' ,'''I haven't agreed with every one of my Republican colleagues or Democratic colleagues on every issue. But I'm supporting Donald Trump because we need change in this country.''' ,'''A republic - if you can keep it - is about limitation, and for good reason, because we are mortal and our actions are imperfect.''' ,'''While that amendment failed, human cloning continues to advance and the breakthrough in this unethical and morally questionable science is around the corner.''' ,'''I truly believe that firearms in the hands of law abiding citizen's makes our families and our communities more safe, not less safe.''' ,'''Anybody that's been in Indiana for five minutes knows that Hoosier hospitality is not a slogan, it's a reality.''' ,'''People are tired of being told that this is as good as it gets. They hear in Donald Trump someone who says, 'We can do better.'''' ,'''People in both parties are restless for change, ready to break free of old patterns in Washington.''' ,'''Well, I think the reality is that as you study - when President Kennedy cut marginal tax rates, when Ronald Reagan cut marginal tax rates, when President Bush imposed those tax cuts, they actually generated economic growth. They expanded the economy. They expand tax revenues.''' ,'''For more than forty years, the United States Congress has shamelessly used payroll taxes intended for Social Security to fund big government spending.''' ,'''Negative campaigning is wrong.''' ,'''I don't believe Rush Limbaugh has a racist bone in his body.''' ,'''The choice could not be more clear. Americans can elect someone who literally personifies the failed establishment in Washington, D.C., or we can choose a leader who will fight every day to Make America Great Again.''' ,'''We cannot have four more years apologizing to our enemies and abandoning our friends.''' ,'''The presidency is the most visible thread that runs through the tapestry of the American government. More often than not, for good or for ill, it sets the tone for the other branches and spurs the expectations of the people.''' ,'''Years ago on my radio show, I used to say, 'I'm a conservative, but I'm not in a bad mood about it.' I've always believed that civility in heavy doses is essential in self-government.''' ,'''The Religious Freedom Restoration Act in Indiana does not give anyone the right to deny services to anyone in this state. It is simply a balancing test used by our federal courts and jurisdictions across the country for more than two decades.''' ,'''I truly do believe that history teaches that weakness arouses evil, and whether it be the horrific attack in France, the inspired attacks here in the United States, the instability in Turkey that led to a coup.''' ,'''I'll tell you from my heart, looking at their party further and further to the left, to paraphrase the director of the FBI: I think it would be extremely careless to elect Hillary Clinton.''' ,'''We can choose a leader who will fight every day to make America great again.''' ,'''The Republican majority, left to its own devices from 1995 to 2000, was a party committed to limited government and restoring the balances of federalism with the states. Clearly, President Bush has had a different vision, and that vision has resulted in education and welfare policies that have increased the size and scope of government.''' ,'''By requiring that any surplus in Social Security taxes be returned to the American people in personal savings accounts, the plan ensures that Social Security taxes will be used for Social Security.''' ,'''I'm interested in continuing our conversation about the discomfiture I picked up in the mainstream media with one particular element of this debate.

The way I was raised was like most Hoosiers, with the golden rule, that you should do unto others what you'd have them do unto you.''' ,'''I think it's time for the media and our leaders to get real and start telling the truth about the impact of adultery on our national life.''' ,'''The American people are tired of being told. They're tired of being told that this is as good as it gets. They're tired of hearing politicians in both parties tell us that we'll get to that tomorrow while we pile a mountain range of debt on our children and our grandchildren.''' ,'''All we're getting from the Democratic majority in Congress and from this White House is more bailouts, more spending, more planned stimulus, more deficits and debt, and the American people have had it.''' ,'''More than anything else, let me be clear - we need to be willing to fight for freedom, and free markets, and traditional moral values.

What is real is that adultery scars tens of thousands of children emotionally and psychologically every year. What is real is that adultery is an open wound in a relationship which more often than not overflows into domestic violence or worse.''' ,'''If I only had 12 years left to live, I'd want to live it as a member of Congress because that was the 12 longest years of my life.''' ,'''The conservative movement today is like that tall ship with its proud captain: strong, accomplished but veering off course into the dangerous and uncharted waters of big government republicanism.''' ,'''It is not for the State Department or even the Secretary of State to say when and how the resources of the American people will be spent.''' ,'''And my Christianity, first and foremost, governed the way that I tried to deal with people.''' ,'''Despite the hysteria from the political class and the media, smoking doesn't kill.''' ,'''Donald Trump understands the anxiety and aspirations of the American people like no leader since Reagan.''' ,'''What I want the Congress of the United States to do, and frankly what I would like to see the President of the United States of America do, is speak a word of support to the people of Iran.''' ,'''I watched my mom and dad build everything that matters - a family, a home and a good name.''' ,'''Most climatologists agree that, at best, global warming is a theory about future climactic conditions and cannot be proven based upon the historic record.''' ,'''Well the truth is, Republicans didn't just lose a few elections, we lost our way.''' ,'''We have rights in America.

My dad, Ed Pence, was a combat veteran in Korea.''' ,'''I never thought I'd live to see the day that an American administration would denounce the state of Israel for rebuilding Jerusalem.''' ,'''In my home state of Indiana, we prove every day that you can build a growing economy on balanced budgets, low taxes, even while making record investments in education and roads and health care.''' ,'''I said after 2006 that Republicans didn't just lose our majority, we lost our way.

Federal funding should reflect the priorities and the values of the majority of the American people.''' ,'''As governor of Indiana, if I were presented a bill that legalized discrimination against any person or group, I would veto it.''' ,'''Regardless of any title I'll ever hold, the most important job I'll ever have is spelled D-A-D.''' ,'''Saddam Hussein was a nightmare for the Iraqi people, and his execution marks the end of an era when violence against innocent men, women and children was a means to wealth and power.''' ,'''I promise you that when the circumstances arise where I have a difference on policy or on presentation, I have - I can tell you in my heart, I know - I would have no hesitation, were I privileged to be vice president, to walk into the president's office, close the door, and share my heart.''' ,'''Like every American, I will never forget where I was on the morning of September 11, 2001.

The Healthy Indiana Plan offers the uninsured an affordable health care plan with savings accounts that they control.''' ,'''If you want a president who will upend the status quo in Washington, D.C., and appoint justices of the Supreme Court who will uphold the Constitution, we have but one choice, and that man is ready.

We want to make it clear that Hoosier hospitality is not a slogan, it's our way of life. It's the reason why people come here from around the world and they come back again and again. Because Hoosiers are the kindest, most generous, most decent people in the world.''' ,'''I just always believe that we should not reward people with citizenship whose first act in this country was a violation of the law. And I continue to hold that view. But let me say, I think there is plenty of room here for compassion. And there's plenty of room here for crafting a solution that will deal with this issue in the long term.''' ,'''Donald Trump is a good man, and he will make a great president of the United States of America.''' ,'''Don't Ask, Don't Tell was a successful compromise in 1993; and so that compromise should remain.''' ,'''It's time for conservative Americans to right the ship again.''' ,'''The true legacy of 9-11 cannot be found among political leaders of the day, but in the citizen soldiers and public safety personnel who answered that day with courage and selflessness.''' ,'''As a conservative who believes in limited government, I believe that the only check on government power in real time is a free and independent press.''' ,'''What I am for is protecting, with the highest standards in our courts, the religious liberty of Hoosiers.''' ,'''It's time for conservative Americans to do what Reagan did.''' ,'''The reality is the cap-and-trade legislation offered by the Democrats amounts to an economic declaration of war on the Midwest by liberals on Capitol Hill.''' ,'''Anybody who is familiar with the historical data from the IRS knows that raising income tax rates will likely actually reduce federal revenues.''' ,'''The American people know what's necessary to get this economy moving again. It's fiscal discipline in Washington, D.C. and across-the-board tax relief for working families, small businesses and family farms.''' ,'''It's a privilege to serve in Washington, D.C., but I never lose sight of what the Lord has called me to do in my life.

That's exactly what it was a year ago. I mean, this - the American people know we can't borrow and spend and bail our way back to a growing economy.''' ,'''I'm a Christian, a conservative, and a Republican, in that order.''' ,'''Trade means jobs, but trade also means security. The time has come for all of us to urge the swift adoption of the Trans Pacific Partnership.''' ,'''Negative personal attacks have no place in public life and serve to erode public confidence in our basic institutions of government.''' ,'''Human cloning is coming.''' ,'''When Donald Trump becomes president of the United States of America, the change will be... huge.''' ,'''Donald Trump gets it: he's the genuine article. He's a doer in a game usually reserved for talkers. And when Donald Trump does his talking, he doesn't tiptoe around the thousand new rules of political correctness.''' ,'''It's time to stop the raid on the Social Security trust fund and start allowing Americans to invest their Social Security taxes in personal savings accounts.''' ,'''Let's resolve here and now that Hillary Clinton will never become the president of the United States of America.''' ,]
