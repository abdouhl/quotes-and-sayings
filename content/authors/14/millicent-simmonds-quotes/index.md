- I'm actually a fan of horror films.
- We have a wonderful world. I feel very lucky to be in it.
- Todd Haynes was incredible, he treated me like an adult, communicated with me, was supportive, he treated me as any director would an actor.
- Growing up, I never thought about becoming an actress because I never saw deaf people in TV or movies. I didn't think it was possible.
- If you're disabled or different from what general society deems normal, it's fine. There will always be people who won't accept you, but there are others you can find who will. You're never alone.
- Scary movies depend on sound a lot to scare people. When I look around and see people are jumping in their seats, I think: Why? Why? Nothing happened!
- I ride my motorcycle with my dad, I hang out with my sisters.
- Texting has definitely improved the communication between the deaf and hearing communities, but it shouldn't be... a substitute for learning the language to really connect with someone, especially someone you want to date or have a relationship with.
- I always wanted to be a cop or a fireman or do something dangerous.
- I'm from a really nice town. Full of nature, mountains, clean air, rock climbing. But I'd prefer New York City. I love the diversity here, the religions, the food - especially the food.
- But I was always comedic and would tell stories and use a lot of expressions.
- I was very shy. I didn't really hang around with hearing people very much. Mostly I had deaf friends.
- What I want to do is encourage more of that, more deaf presence in TV, movies, acting, modeling - that's really what I want to work toward.
- When I was in 2nd or 3rd grade, the drama teacher at my deaf school noticed that I liked to tell stories and had really good expression. I could entertain people with my stories.
- One of my favorite movies is 'Paper Moon.'
- A lot of people say the middle child is the most adventurous. That's me!
- I want to travel the world - like Egypt. I love history. That's my favorite subject at school. From the building of the pyramids to... King Tut. Their way of working without technology. I find all that fascinating.
- New York is my favorite city. I would love to move there one day.
- When I read the script for 'A Quiet Place', I immediately wanted to be a part of the film. It is such a unique story and I love my character, Regan.
- I think it's really important that we have diversity - whether it's different languages, cultures - be involved in film and in the arts.
- I don't know that hearing people have ever felt that experience of truly being left out. They have easy communication, while deaf people can't join in. It takes more time to communicate with us.
- To really understand a deaf person's experience, you need someone that is deaf to be able to tell you what their experience is.
- We do need more deaf people in Hollywood. But I don't think that deaf people always have to play a deaf role. I think we can play different roles. We need to see more diversity period. More people of color. More disabled people. More gender diversity. All kinds of diversity.
- I wouldn't mind if I had to travel every single day. I love meeting new people and experiencing new things, making new connections with people in different places.
- I don't really like fashion.
- I'm not as savvy and knowledgable about all of the directors that are out there, but as a person, I'm really open-minded and love meeting new people and watching the way directors film and their perspectives and following their lead.
- I love to read. My favorite book series is 'Cherubs'.
- I have no problem with how people communicate. But I think it's important... for everyone to be open to learn sign language.
- I don't use my voice a lot in public.
- I'd love to continue acting. Maybe start a business.
- I want to study philosophy. That fascinates me.
- When I lost my hearing, my mom got a deaf mentor to come into the home.
- In third or fourth grade, I loved to sign stories and monologues.
- I'm happy being deaf. I'm happy with my life and my family.
- I think signing gave 'A Quiet Place' a unique quality. I think sign language is represented as beautiful and helpful.
- American Sign Language is a language. It's fun to learn, and it's different from other languages because you use your hands, you use your face, your facial expressions, and there is also an incredible culture that comes with it and an amazing community too, and through that, we can support each other.
- I'd like to meet more people and gain more experiences and travel.
- I think hearing kids my age miss out on genuine connections already because they text so much, and then they feel awkward when they are face to face with someone.
- When I was younger I didn't want to hang around with anyone. But now I feel so comfortable. I convey my thoughts, my emotions, I can communicate better, I have a better understanding of the world. Now I have a sense of purpose. It makes me think a lot more about things.
- The deaf community relies so much on eye contact, expression and body language. It's such a huge part of who we are.
- I was in several school performances, mainly Shakespeare and comedic roles. I just accidentally became an actor. I totally didn't expect this.
- My advice for young people is to just be yourself. There's no pressure. Do what you want to do. And if you want to do something, then go after it and make it happen.
