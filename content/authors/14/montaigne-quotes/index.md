But we can get over it.''' ,'''I'm all about preaching forgiveness and compassion.''' ,'''I went to all of Dad's football games. As I got older, I got involved. He taught me everything I know about playing it.''' ,'''I'd probably do something that involved music, a booking agent or working at a label, if not being an actual musician.''' ,'''I spent my first five years in Canberra then moved to Sydney, where I moved around the Hills District until the age of 18.''' ,'''My true memory has been tainted by old home videos of my sister and I, ages 3 and 5 respectively, singing karaoke to Britney Spears' 'Lucky' in our living room, and tape recordings of my parents trying to elicit songs out of our throats at a similar or younger age.''' ,''''Ready' is dedicated to young people who are not yet jaded and worn down by the realities of this world.''' ,'''I take after my dad in the calm and measured way he approaches situations.''' ,'''I love music, I've always done music, felt it on a spiritual level and I write for myself and not anybody else.''' ,'''My biggest strength in life is that I'm good at learning and I'm really good at admitting when I'm wrong and recalibrating my perspective.''' ,'''Dad is a skilled athlete and runs his own football school for kids. While football is his entire life and he encouraged us to play, he still found time to take me to ballet and tennis lessons.''' ,'''I realised the animal agriculture industry is actually awful and tragic and I can't bear to be a part of that. The environmental impact of the agriculture industry, the health impact on us, there's all the reasons.''' ,'''With San Cisco, young kids are more willing to yell at whoever is standing on stage. The difference between the yelling and the quietness is if the older crowd are quiet, they're showing you respect. When you do get a cheer back from them, it's special because they are actually listening.''' ,'''I believe in reinventing oneself if one has messed up and is repentant and actually makes an effort to change for the better, I'm all about that.''' ,]
