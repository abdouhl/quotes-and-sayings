He's the real thing. I can tell you this. Russell Crowe was just as difficult before he was an international star as he was afterwards.''' ,'''It isn't glamorous until after the film is finished, and you are at the premiere and getting your picture on the cover of magazines.''' ,'''Show business is one of those things that people can use to get themselves out of the lower rung of society.''' ,'''I try to get the best performance an actor can give.''' ,'''I feel very comfortable shooting music, and I think you can see that.''' ,'''It's very clearly stated in the film: You make your own choices, and what you're always fighting is ego.''' ,'''But the process of making a film is not glamorous. Certainly not my films.''' ,'''Ray Charles, in his own way, it's like at the beginning, Ray Charles changed American music, not once but twice.''' ,'''The SAS is the most elite of the special forces in the world. They are not people who go out and advertise; they keep it inside. They don't want anybody to know about them.''' ,'''You'd be surprised how many movie stars still care about the work.''' ,'''I make films about working class people.''' ,]
