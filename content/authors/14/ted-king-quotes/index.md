quotes = ['''People send me CDs all the time because I love music. It's great. I listen to them in my dressing room or in my car.''' ,'''I got into music when I was a little boy. My dad was always into jazz. I got my education from him. The first time I listened to jazz, he gave me a Thelonious Monk record. It was so different from anything I had ever heard. It took me a while to understand it, and I liked that. I liked the fact that it wasn't immediately palatable.''' ,'''I have tons of jazz records: John Coltrane, Thelonious Monk, Miles Davis. I could go on and on.''' ,'''I collect LPs, but only if they're pretty high quality. I don't go back and dig through the bins.''' ,]
