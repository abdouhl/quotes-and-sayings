- I was the black atheist kid in the all-white Catholic school run by nuns.
- If we're all living in ourselves and mistaking it for life, then we're devaluing and desensitizing life.
- I don't put the pressure on myself to be a very successful movie star. I want to enjoy being an actor and I want to be challenged by the roles I take.
- I actually see a lot of the pain and destruction, like Black Lives Matter, in the long-term as positive because it shows that we're moving forward; we're evolving and moving and challenging the frontiers.
- When I am out and about I feel watched. It's become second nature. The only time I get to be private is in my work. That is when I liberate the ego. The blessed-out sensation of liberating the ego.
- We have all the power. Us consumers have all the power, and if we can show that, 'Hey, I want transparency,' Hey, I want something that's going to be nutritious and great,' then suddenly, kale will be all over the marketplace, and turmeric will be all over the marketplace.
- I can hardly find the words to describe the peace I felt when I was acting. My dysfunctional self could actually plug in to another self, not my own, and it felt so good.
- I'll be 40 this year but honestly would not consider surgery; all my beauty icons are women with expressive faces. Isabelle Huppert ages so beautifully and gracefully, as have Maggie Smith and Judi Dench. I am struck by their expressive beauty.
- I guess patriarchal stereotypes have, as is true for most people, created painful moments in my life. As a result, I'm an activist. I'm for women's rights, children's rights, human rights, animal rights. I want to be part of the solutions to try to correct imbalance. And 'Westworld,' for me, is that.
- Before I was pregnant, I drank fresh beetroot juice every day, which is anti-inflammatory. I couldn't live without my juicer.
- If I could change my appearance, I would have the gap between my front teeth put back in.
- I see a wiser person than when I was younger: having babies, and passing 30, were the turning points. What women in their 40s - I am 39 - lack in gorgeousness, they make up for in wisdom. I love ageing, despite the drawbacks - thinner, drier skin.
- I think when girls hear Beyonce, it makes them move and want to lift their arms up and be strong, be powerful. She puts this energy of positivity out there, which is good for people's souls. I think musicians are kind of like shamans: they're bringing the vibrations of a more spiritual state.
- I use the film industry as a pleasure for work and that kind of thing and it's not a pursuit to make me feel happy in my life.
- I'd love to do yoga every day. I don't usually have time, but a few sun salutations go a long way.
- We each have a self, but I don't think that we're born with one. You know how newborn babies believe they're part of everything; they're not separate? Well that fundamental sense of oneness is lost on us very quickly. It's like that initial stage is over - oneness: infancy, unformed, primitive. It's no longer valid or real.
- Having children is life-changing, to state the obvious. It's a gigantic shift in your life and I welcomed it.
- I'm good at playing the emotionally strangled person. The woman who is in the worst place in her life. That's me!
- I can hardly find the words to describe the peace I felt when I was acting. My dysfunctional self could actually plug in to another self, not my own, and it felt so good. It was the first time that I existed inside a fully-functioning self - one that I controlled, that I steered, that I gave life to.
- I love being in my forties. Just getting there and realising that you haven't grown horns or boils on your bum, when all the time it had been this thing looming in the future, is such a relief.
- I'm always angry. I wake up angry. There is a lot to be angry about. Anger is a positive energy.
- When I first started, as long as you were a bit brown, you could play any kind of ethnic anything. Now it's much more localised and specific. I feel like a wise old woman looking back on the evolution of how much more sophisticated audiences are.
- Tell a story with your eyes when you face the camera - it makes all the difference. My best tip for making skin look good in photographs is to go easy on the make-up. You don't want it to look heavy and mask-like.
- I was absolutely blown away when I first talked to Lisa Joy and Jonah Nolan at how ambitious they wanted 'Westworld' to be in looking at the drives that are leading human beings over the cliff of existence.
- I do a lot of jivamukti yoga; it keeps me supple, strong and focused.
- Yoga stretches out your body and releases lactic acid. I do it four times a week, and my skin feels fantastic afterwards. When I'm doing a film, I do it every day - I keep a yoga mat in my trailer. Sometimes I do it in front of the TV. The stretching makes me feel so good. It gets my heart going and helps me breathe deeply.
- I grew up on the coast of England in the '70s. My dad is white from Cornwall, and my mom is black from Zimbabwe. Even the idea of us as a family was challenging to most people.
- We're all the same, and we all want the same thing. We all want to be secure. We all want food on the table. We want to know that our kids aren't going to be destroyed when they're not with us. We all want the same things, and if we've been hurt in our childhoods, we try and recreate the same hurt.
- We're in this amazing frontier of transparency. WikiLeaks. Edward Snowden. 'Westworld' is reflecting that with these robots gaining consciousness. Them coming into consciousness is almost like us, human beings, coming into the truth of the fact that government is corrupt. Police are corrupt. Banks are corrupt. Etcetera, etcetera.
- You need a good, healthy diet - it's about finding out what your body needs. Sugar is a disaster for skin, as is white flour.
- I'm not being cynical, but I have to find work that is allowing me to pay bills and keep our lives going in a way that we're used to and trying not to betray my political beliefs while I'm doing it. Listen, it's a tough thing to do.
- I've been different things in different contexts, and I didn't really feel beautiful until I had my first child. I knew that I was considered 'People' magazine's Most Whatever, but all that stuff is just how we label different groups. And I've been very not beautiful in my life. There's no way I was beautiful growing up.
- You see these casting directors' lists of characters, and they're all boxed in. Twenties is the hot girlfriend, thirties you can still be hot but moving swiftly to hot mum. Forties, you're the legal person in a pantsuit. Then, once you reach your fifties, you're positively elderly.
- Then I became a mother and it just fills every space, that isn't filled with something else important. It's just like this incredible balloon that blows up and fills life up.
- Often, when you go to the movies or the theatre, you think, Jesus Christ, everybody is white. But my daughter goes to an amazing dance school called Ballet Black, and they have every colour: dark, white, mixed. It looks like the future to me.
- I love how close you are to current affairs and social issues here in England. Out in L.A., you have to make an effort to look outside that little microcosm. It's almost like it's a virtual reality to imagine a problem there.
- Olay does a great tinted moisturiser that I add a little turmeric to - making it more yellow depending on my skin tone and the season. That's a great trick for all women who find that foundations are too ashy or too pink for their skins. And it's anti-inflammatory. It's my secret weapon.
- I never understood the point of juicing - I always thought I could get enough nutrients from eating fruit and vegetables - but now I'm a convert.
- In the morning, I never cleanse. I just splash my face with water and pat it dry. I honestly think that the human body is a clever thing and that the natural oils my skin produces are best for it. Then I apply a dab of rouge, and I'm off.
