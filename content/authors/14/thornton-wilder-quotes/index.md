We are at the beginning of the second week. We are children of the eighth day.''' ,'''If I wasn't an actor, I'd be a secret agent.''' ,'''In advertising, not to be different is virtual suicide.''' ,'''My advice to you is not to inquire why or whither, but just enjoy your ice cream while it's on your plate.''' ,'''There's nothing like eavesdropping to show you that the world outside your head is different from the world inside your head.''' ,]
