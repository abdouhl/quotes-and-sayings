quotes = ['''I was elected to fight for the people of New Jersey, to win federal investment in our infrastructure, to strengthen our health care, to address gun violence, and get back our SALT deductions.''' ,'''The respect for the rights of minorities that China's Tibetan and Uighur activists champion would prevent instability that could spill across China's borders.''' ,'''When the Islamic State attacked Christian villages in the Khabur River Valley of eastern Syria in early 2015, it was our airstrikes, guided by information provided by local Christian communities, that stopped the terrorists' advance.''' ,'''Capping our SALT deduction was a deliberate attempt to punish states that value quality public services.''' ,'''I've traveled the world, and I've seen how people marvel at the United States of America, at our democracy, at our ambition to build what so few countries have - a nation defined not by race or tribe or religion or place of birth but by an idea, that everyone is created equal.''' ,'''At the State Department, I oversaw the U.S. government's efforts to get information into North Korea. We funded defector-run radio stations, which had the added benefit of training North Koreans to be journalists.''' ,'''As a former Assistant Secretary of State, Senior Director on the National Security Council, and Washington Director for Human Rights Watch, I hope to bring unique experience and knowledge to the Foreign Affairs Committee.''' ,'''There are norms that preserve some equilibrium between chaos and stability in the world; that keep sociopaths like Assad from undermining that equilibrium, and the sense of security without which the freedoms we enjoy cannot exist.''' ,'''Kim Jong Un, like all totalitarian leaders, wants above all to ensure his survival. He is convinced that a nuclear strike capability is necessary to deter the United States and South Korea from threatening his regime, and to extract concessions that might prolong its life.''' ,'''A computer can process information and engage a weapon infinitely faster than a human soldier.''' ,'''Ethiopia is a major contributor to peace and security in Africa, the U.S.'s ally in the fight against violent extremists, and has shown incredible generosity to those escaping violence and repression, admitting more refugees than any country in the world.''' ,'''Protecting our democracy shouldn't be a partisan issue.''' ,'''To me, greatness does not mean mortgaging the future of our middle class by giving tax cuts to our wealthiest citizens.''' ,'''A transactional foreign policy is not what convinces people around the world to stand with America.''' ,'''Corruption empowers and enriches dictators.''' ,'''We need to protect immigrants who come here seeking a better life, rather than turning our backs on refugees and closing our borders and our hearts to others.''' ,'''An American government that really wanted to stick it to the Chinese Communist Party would be reinforcing U.S. alliances in Asia, instead of threatening to withdraw troops from South Korea and Japan until they pay extortionate rates for U.S. bases.''' ,'''We don't stop Russia or any other country from trying to influence public debate in the United States on any issue.''' ,'''If members of Congress were to vote to allow a military action, they might then share the blame if the mission were to go wrong. So they demand in the abstract that presidents ask their approval for going to war but in practice prefer to let presidents bear the burden alone.''' ,'''No child should be afraid to go to school, and Americans from all walks of life: students, parents, law enforcement, veterans, and law abiding gun owners, are demanding that we act to keep our kids safe.''' ,'''The chance to profit from corruption is why many authoritarian leaders seize and cling to power.''' ,'''We are a country where the ancestors of slaves and newcomers escaping tyranny and violence can rise to the highest positions in the land.''' ,'''I believe in our country's greatness.''' ,'''In America, we have holidays and monuments that celebrate heroes from our past, most of whom have legacies that are settled.''' ,'''The desire to help those struggling abroad gain the freedoms enjoyed here at home has remained a uniquely unifying force in American politics.''' ,'''After leaving the Obama administration, I guess I got tired of pulling my hair out over Trump and the Republican Congress and thought I needed to do something practical about it.''' ,'''When an issue is important to Washington, U.S. officials figure out what leverage they have and use it as assertively and creatively as they can.

To Eastern Europeans, the vow is a painful reminder of how Joseph Stalin, Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt carved up their small countries after World War II, placing them, against their will, under Soviet domination.''' ,'''When I was in government, I urged Congress to require that information about the actual owners of companies registered in the U.S. be disclosed to the Treasury Department, and made available on request to law enforcement.''' ,'''The American people do not want to waste billions of dollars on a wall that won't stop illegal immigration but will make America look fearful and foolish.''' ,'''Our people need significant investments in bridges, tunnels and roads.''' ,'''Congress has a constitutional right to help decide and limit how the country uses its military power.

Secretary of State, I often urged authoritarian governments around the world not to use emergency powers to defy their legislatures, courts, and laws.''' ,'''Few provisions of the Constitution are more plain than Article 1, Section 9, Clause 7: 'No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.'''' ,'''It is an honor and privilege to serve as a member of the 116th Congress.''' ,'''Let's face it: much of what we truly value in life is rooted in our experience of repression and conflict.''' ,'''The possibility of change in North Korea arose from its greatest calamity - the famine in the 1990s, in which over a million of its citizens died.

The idea that their contributions would not be recognized at the same level as a male colleague is abhorrent to me.

And he wasn't: he voted with the NRA; supported the Iraq War; elevated Sarah Palin.''' ,'''TPP will require all countries that join the agreement to conform their laws and practices to fundamental labor rights and principles. Vietnam will have to make the necessary reforms or miss out on the agreement's benefits.''' ,'''Russia's interference in the United States' 2016 election could not have been more different from what the United States does to promote democracy in other countries, efforts for which I was responsible as a State Department official.''' ,'''We learn to laugh from the cultures that suffered most - from the Russians, Poles, and Irish - not from Sweden or France (the French go for Jerry Lewis - enough said).''' ,'''You can usually figure what Russian President Vladimir Putin is doing and why by noting the actions and values he falsely projects onto others.''' ,'''Words matter. Words can be a fire to the gasoline of disturbed minds.''' ,'''I pledge to put patriotism over party, and commit to the hard work of real reform over cheap political wins, quick fixes, and empty promises.''' ,'''A robotic arms race seems inevitable unless nations collectively decide to avoid one.''' ,'''The president has immense powers, but he cannot spend money unless we, the people's representatives in Congress, have agreed that he can.''' ,'''In a totalitarian state like North Korea, a group of neighbors gathering once a week to watch the latest episode of a forbidden soap opera is committing a political act, and forming, with the market traders who deliver them this treasure, a rudimentary civil society.''' ,'''Protecting those with pre-existing conditions was one of the greatest health care reforms in our country's history and must be protected at all costs.''' ,'''Ever since the end of the Cold War, it has been our paramount interest in Europe to strengthen NATO and to extend it - an effort I was part of when I served in the State Department and the NSC in two administrations.''' ,'''I recognize that most Americans are tired of U.S. troops fighting in Afghanistan after more than 18 years of war. I am, too.''' ,'''The House Foreign Affairs Committee can and should become the principal institution in Washington exercising foreign policy oversight and serving as an alternative voice for America to the world. I hope to make a significant contribution in that effort.''' ,'''I am categorically opposed to BDS, because it seeks to delegitimize the state of Israel, opposes a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and encourages anti-Semitism.''' ,'''Any strategy to promote democracy and human rights must have the fight against corruption at its heart.''' ,'''The advancement of democracy and human rights is as serious a business as anything we do in our foreign policy and cannot be treated as an afterthought in our relations with great powers.''' ,'''We were right to seek practical cooperation with Russia and to encourage its integration as a respected power into global institutions.''' ,'''It is utterly wrong for a president - any president - to shutter the government of the United States when he can't persuade the Congress and the American people to give him what he wants.''' ,'''Arresting opposition leaders and restricting civil society will not stop people from protesting, but it can create leaderless movements that leave no one with whom the government can mediate a peaceful way forward.''' ,'''It is deterrence that has prevented the use of nuclear weapons by all states that possess them since 1945.''' ,'''An administration that really wanted to win an ideological contest with the Chinese Communist Party would stand up for human rights consistently, rather than calling journalists anywhere 'the enemy of the people.'''' ,'''The United States and Ethiopia have years of strong partnership, based on a recognition that we need each other.''' ,'''In principle, there is nothing wrong with the United States negotiating directly with the Taliban.''' ,'''The rule of law that China's dissidents ask for is important to U.S. businesses investing in China as well.''' ,'''Fighting corruption by improving financial transparency may be one of the most effective ways of promoting liberty around the world.''' ,'''I'd much rather face the voters defending what's right and true than to have to explain selling my country and my soul to Donald Trump.''' ,'''Leading with its values gave the United States a sense of purpose in the Cold War.''' ,'''Anyone who is willing and able to put their life on the line to protect America should be honored, not punished.''' ,'''In a sense, the central problem in U.S.-Russian relations has been a form of psychological projection. Putin views foreign policy as a means of enhancing Russia's - and his regime's - security, power and wealth in a zero-sum competition with other states.
