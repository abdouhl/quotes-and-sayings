But what's most important is that you have to be a good person and care about others and carry yourself well.''' ,'''I worked in retail for a bit and then I busked for two years.

We were all just singing a song and my aunty was like 'oh guys, she can actually hold a note.' I think that's the earliest memory of someone actually pointing me out as someone that has an ability to sing. I was probably like 7 years old.''' ,'''Well, the first Australian tour I literally just took busking to the stage.''' ,'''I never thought that I would have the No 1 song in the world.''' ,'''I thought the world of live performance and busking was where I was going to thrive. I had no idea that digital streaming platforms and radio and that world would be for me, you know?''' ,'''Dance Monkey' is about the bad side of busking.''' ,'''I was living in my van, playing on the street for almost two years.''' ,'''I have confidence in the songs that I've written and I'm not going to change anything.''' ,'''I didn't think I had a weird voice until everyone started saying I did.''' ,'''I don't want to focus too much on trying to write a song for radio.''' ,'''I want to play the Super Bowl halftime show in America.''' ,'''No one could have ever prepared me for the whole world judging me and comparing me to other artists.''' ,'''Sometimes I don't think that I'm the most relatable female artist.''' ,'''I'm just going to keep trying to write music for me because that's what got me here.''' ,'''Usually I get inspired by singles and not artists, but I love Macklemore.''' ,'''I'm just going to do what I do and be who I am.''' ,'''When I was busking, when I was paying for petrol with silver coins or when I was sneaking into hostels so I could park my van up and sleep in it, I had the best time of my life.''' ,'''I was getting a little bit bullied by guys who thought I was taking their customers, and it got to the point where I was anxious every time I set up my keyboard.''' ,'''Dance Monkey' showed me that I'm good enough.''' ,'''People think you should be happy all the time but you can't.''' ,'''Now I am at the point people are believing in my music, I couldn't live with myself if I didn't talk about what I believe in.''' ,'''People like me for who I am, I don't wanna change that, if anything I just wanna hone my craft and get better at it.''' ,]
