quotes = ['''It's productive and fun to try interpreting cave paintings, but ultimately, they can't teach us anything beyond what we imagine them to be.''' ,'''When you look at the number of satellites, what they're doing and what they represent, it is really a vision of trying to have the world in your clutches.''' ,'''Show me what society that ever existed that did not use the tools that they had available. Ask any person from East Germany... you will never hear somebody say, 'The Stasi never bothered me because I didn't have anything to hide.' That's not a thing that people say.''' ,'''I think mass surveillance is a bad idea because a surveillance society is one in which people understand that they are constantly monitored.''' ,'''If I was a CIA front company, what would I want to be able to do? Well, I would want to be able to land at military airfields as a civilian, so there's got to be some document that the Air Force or the Army has that would list all the civilian aircraft that are cleared to land at military bases.''' ,'''The dragon is a very consistent symbol of secret satellite iconography and signals intelligence satellites.''' ,'''When we look up into the starry night sky, we tend to see reflections of ourselves.''' ,'''I don't feel it incumbent on me to make sense of everything.''' ,'''Civilian law around aviation is much looser than those governing military. Civilian planes can basically fly wherever they want in the world.''' ,'''Looking out at the photographic landscape that surrounds us - the world of images and image-making that we inhabit - it seems obvious that photography has undergone dramatic changes in its technical, cultural, and critical composition.''' ,'''One project I am pretty excited about is 'Autonomy Cube.' These are basically minimalist sculptures that create a free and open Wi-Fi network wherever you install them, and they are routed over Tor, which basically anonymizes the traffic of everybody using it.''' ,'''Art is more than a series of images that are disembodied. Art is objects that live in real places, economies, spaces, architecture.''' ,'''We know that, immediately after 9/11, the CIA set up a program to collaborate with 80 foreign countries to varying degrees. The CIA also started funding other intelligence services in order to use them as proxies. We also know that some of these collaborations were kept off the record; supposedly, there is no paper trail.''' ,'''The world is constantly changing, and I feel like my job is to try to see how it is changing.''' ,'''If secrecy is made out of the same stuff that the rest of the world is made out of, then it's fundamentally visible, which means that secrecy can only fail in the first instance, in the sense that you cannot make something disappear.''' ,'''I think of my visual work as an exploration of political epistemology: the politics of how we know what we think we know.''' ,'''Creating artworks, writing and publishing novels, poetry, music, or conducting art-historical research requires support. So does everything else in the world, from physics to fish and wildlife management to human-rights advocacy.''' ,'''At extreme distances, there is essentially no such thing as depth of field.''' ,'''I would argue that racism, for example, is a feature of machine learning - it's not a bug.''' ,'''In the very near future, I guarantee that the pictures you post on social media will affect your credit rating, health and auto insurance policies, and much more. It will all happen automatically. In a very real way, our rights and freedoms will be modulated by our metadata signatures. What's at stake, obviously, is the future of the human race!''' ,'''I can't imagine anything more beautiful on this planet than looking up at the stars and seeing a kind of artificial star moving through the night sky.''' ,'''In the late 19th century, Russian Cosmists such as Nikolai Fyodorov believed we need to go to space to collect all the particles of all the people who had ever lived. Cosmism says going into space is going into the past.''' ,'''What would the infrastructure of the Internet look like if mass surveillance wasn't its business model?''' ,'''I believe that art can make relevant and progressive contributions to culture and society.''' ,'''Photographs don't 'reveal' much at all but instead help us generate a kind of visual vocabulary that we can use to make sense of the world and direct our attention to certain things around us. In other words, they help us learn how to see.''' ,'''On one hand, the idea of sending pictures off into the vastness of space and time seems nonsensical. On the other, I felt like the gesture carried an enormous amount of responsibility.''' ,'''One of the kinds of things I'm consistently interested in is what the border between the seen and not seen is and the border between being able to perceive something and not perceive it.''' ,'''Infrastructures of power always inhabit the surface of the earth somehow, or the skies above the earth. They're material things, always, and even though the metaphors we use to describe them are often immaterial - for example, we might describe the Internet as the Cloud or cyberspace - those metaphors are wildly misleading.''' ,'''What I'm trying to do is to get a glimpse into the secret state that surrounds us all the time but that we have not trained ourselves to see very well.''' ,'''I really don't think art is good at answering questions. It's much better at posing questions - and even better at simply asking people to open their eyes.''' ,'''Images can make realities out of people and struggles - the reality we give them. Images really matter.''' ,'''Injustice drives me crazy!''' ,'''It's common knowledge that most of the guys at Guantanamo are nobodies. Many were turned in by bounty hunters.''' ,'''If you are a plane-spotter, and you are interested in the history of a particular aircraft, you know there are many documents publicly available: registration papers and airworthiness certificates from the FAA. You can also get flight data from the FAA.''' ,'''I am not a journalist or an academic.''' ,'''The NRO is like a secret twin to NASA. It's the U.S.' 'other' space agency. The agency is about as old as NASA, but its existence was secret until 1992.''' ,'''I think that some of the earliest ideas in the modern period were actually from astronomy. You look at Galileo: He goes up and points his telescope up at Jupiter and finds out, hey, Jupiter has these moons.''' ,'''The Internet was supposed to be the greatest tool of global communications and means of sharing knowledge in human history. And it is. But it has also become the most effective instrument of mass surveillance and potentially one of the greatest instruments of totalitarianism in the history of the world.''' ,'''We didn't have to use technology to build a surveillance state.''' ,'''Creative projects are rarely the result of a single person's efforts.''' ,'''We imagine going to the moon and planting a flag, going to an asteroid and mining, going to Mars and setting up a colony. And I think that expansionist mentality is very self-destructive, especially given the kind of precarious relationship we now have to the ecosystem here on Earth, because it allows us to imagine that Earth is disposable.''' ,'''We humans have always looked to the sky as a sounding board for asking big questions about ourselves: Who are we? Where did we come from? Where are we going?''' ,'''If you create a place where anything can happen, anything will happen.''' ,'''I think that a lot of us subconsciously would like to live in a world in which good things were beautiful and bad things were ugly. But that's not how the world works.''' ,'''Digital surveillance programs require concrete data centres; intelligence agencies are based in real buildings. Surveillance systems ultimately consist of technologies, people, and the vast network of material resources that supports them.''' ,'''Many of the things that shape the way the world looks are, quite frankly, invisible.''' ,'''I don't put work in an art gallery because the next day I want people to march in the streets.''' ,'''When people understand that they are constantly monitored, they are more conformist - they are less willing to take up controversial positions - and that kind of mass conformity is incompatible with democracy.''' ,''''The Last Pictures' is meant to create a framework to think about the long-term effects of human civilizations and the transformations we've made to the world around us. Having said that, every person in the world would have done the project differently, so in that sense, I guess it bears my creative stamp.''' ,'''In a democracy, the citizens are supposed to have all the power, and the government is supposed to be the means by which the citizens exercise that power. But when you have a surveillance state, the state has all the power, and citizens have very little.''' ,'''In human geography, we think about landscapes as being political, social, cultural, economic, and physical things all at the same time. And that's the way that I wanted to approach the question of state secrecy.''' ,'''I pretty much made a conscious decision to make projects a lot of people can relate to.''' ,'''Do cave paintings mean anything? Not really, but I, for one, am happy to have them.''' ,'''Oftentimes, secrecy involves creating spaces that are outside of the law but are outside the normal channels of oversight. And I think it's pretty easy to see that if you create spaces that are essentially outside the law, then you're creating spaces where anything can happen.''' ,'''I think the automation of vision is a much bigger deal than the invention of perspective.''' ,'''If we look in the right places at the right times, we can begin to glimpse America's vast intelligence infrastructure.''' ,'''For millennia, artists and mystics have pondered the question of how to represent that which, by definition, cannot or must not be represented.''' ,'''I wanted to make an artwork that really underlined the contradiction between how machines see and how humans see. Because music is so affective and is just as corporeal as it is cerebral, I thought coupling a music performance with machine vision adds up to something that work on an emotional, aesthetic, and intellectual level.''' ,'''I think of AI itself as a monster of capitalism.''' ,'''Image-making, along with storytelling and music, is the stuff that culture is made out of.''' ,'''I have to admit that I'm not very good with grammar. They taught grammar in elementary and high school, but I went to public schools, so I never really learned it.''' ,'''In the traditional academic literature, secrecy is thought of as a set of bureaucratic operations - hiding files and hiding information, that sort of thing.''' ,'''Much of the way we understand the world is through images. That's what I think good art does - it teaches you how to see the historical moment that you live in.''' ,'''People like to say that my work is about making the invisible visible, but that's a misunderstanding. It's about showing what invisibility looks like.''' ,'''Anything humans can do in space, robots can do better.''' ,'''What started happening really quickly after 9/11 and the construction of this 'War on Terror' business is that I saw all kinds of parallels between the way that was being constructed and the way that prisons had been constructed since the early 1980s.''' ,'''It's not okay for me to behave as if I'm cynical about the future. Even if I am.''' ,'''American intelligence and military agencies have a huge footprint in terms of how the world works, but they're largely invisible. I'm interested in exploring those 'geographies' of secrecy from many different angles: political, legal, economic, spatial, etc., because I am fundamentally just interested in how the world works and how societies work.''' ,'''My dad was not one of these stereotypical military people - buzz-cut, rah-rah-rah.''' ,'''I always start with the assumption that everything that happens in the world is actually in the world. It sounds like an obvious thing to say, but it's a very powerful methodological premise.''' ,'''Perhaps 'photography' has become so all-pervasive that it no longer makes sense to think about it as a discreet practice or field of inquiry. In other words, perhaps 'photography,' as a meaningful cultural trope, is over.''' ,'''Once, I got lost in the middle of the desert and had to follow the North Star to find the dirt road where my truck was parked a few miles away. Another time, I got stuck in quicksand for two days.''' ,'''Technologically, it is not hard to launch an object into space. Emotionally, it has been difficult.''' ,'''I would say that the fundamental question of geography is about how humans shaped the Earth's surface and how we, in turn, are shaped by the ways in which we have shaped the Earth's surface. So, for me, geography was just a set of tools that allowed me to ask these kinds of questions and to try to think through them.''' ,'''The most famous secret base, I guess, would be Area 51, which a lot of people have heard of as a kind of mythical place. Well, it's a real place.''' ,'''Every person who went into the space industry did so because they looked up at the sky and were fascinated by it - not because they wanted to make a military or commercial object.''' ,'''Nothing that you make in the world exists in isolation from the social and political and ecological dimensions of it.''' ,'''Traditionally, images have functioned as representations of something in the world, but we are quickly approaching the point where vast majority of images are produced for other machines, and no human being will ever see them.''' ,'''In religion, symbols have always played a iconographic and ritualistic role. Different symbols might represent different theological ideas.''' ,'''Engineers working in the 'black world' of classified military projects are often referred to in military circles as 'black hats.' There are a lot of jokes about the difference between 'white hats' and their spooky counterparts.''' ,'''Religions have always adopted rich symbolic languages to signify the different aspects of their respective forms of faith and mythology.''' ,'''It was a very strange time in the late 1950s/early 1960s, when people were putting things in space, but that language of spacecraft hadn't really congealed yet. A lot of artists at that time were looking at them as aesthetic objects.''' ,'''Once you start looking into the infrastructure, it becomes obvious very quickly that 99 percent of the world's information goes through little tubes under the ocean. Those are very juicy targets for someone who wants to surveil the world.''' ,'''The U.S. space program has mythologies attached to pioneering and conquering, but the Russian tradition is very different. In the Russian tradition, the ultimate goal of humanity was to resurrect all humans.''' ,'''Seeing various aspects of the secret state and surveillance state echoes a long tradition in art of looking at the sublime.''' ,'''Although the organizing logic of our nation's surveillance apparatus is invisibility and secrecy, its operations occupy the physical world.''' ,'''The dead spacecraft in orbit have become a permanent fixture around our planet, not unlike the rings of Saturn. They will be the longest-lasting artifacts of human civilization, quietly circling the Earth until the sun turns into a red giant about 5 billion years from now.''' ,'''How has the sky been transformed by drones? How has the ocean been transformed by the fact that over 90% of the world's information travels in underwater cables?''' ,'''Before Christianity became the Roman Empire's official religion in the 4th Century, 'mystery religions,' organized around a central canon of secret knowledge, were widespread. Membership in such religions was limited to people who had passed through secret initiation rituals and had begun to learn a body of hidden knowledge.''' ,'''I want to help develop a visual and cultural vocabulary around surveillance.''' ,'''For me, one of the jobs of an artist is to try to see changes taking place.''' ,'''What I thought was fascinating about comparative religion was that these were the stories that humans have told themselves about where they come from, who they are and where they're going, and what it means to be alive on the planet.''' ,'''Artists have historically understood images better than anyone else. This is what we do.''' ,'''Photography has become so fundamental to the way we see that 'photography' and 'seeing' are becoming more and more synonymous. The ubiquity of photography is, perhaps ironically, a challenge to curators, practitioners, and critics.''' ,'''Geosynchronous spacecraft will be among civilization's most enduring remnants, quietly circling Earth until the Earth is no more.''' ,'''For me, there's something very romantic about going and looking at the stars and trying to photograph spy satellites.''' ,'''I think that one of the most important things that art can do is give you a reason to look at something, almost give you permission to look at something.''' ,'''When we look at something that is alien to us, that is beyond our comprehension, what do we see but ourselves?''' ,'''To me, traditional approaches to doing photography and thinking about photography feel increasingly anachronistic.''' ,]
