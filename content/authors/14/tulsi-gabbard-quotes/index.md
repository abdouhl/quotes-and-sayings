quotes = ['''No member of any 'grouping' should be judged by the activity of some other individual in that same grouping.''' ,'''We need to stop judging individuals based on their race, profession, gender, religion, or anything other than their own individual behavior and character.''' ,'''Some Republicans are good, and some Republicans are bad. Some Democrats are good, and some Democrats are bad. There are good police, and there are bad police. There are good black people and bad black people. There are good white people and bad white people.''' ,'''I am proud to be the first Hindu American to have been elected to Congress and now the first Hindu American to run for president.''' ,'''I am a very firm believer in the Aloha spirit - respect and love for everyone, irrespective of their religion, race, sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation.''' ,'''Our nation was founded on the principle that our government should be of the people, by the people, and for the people - where all people are treated equally, and with respect, in these United States of America.''' ,'''We must stop arming terrorists.''' ,'''I was raised in Hawaii in what I call a 'faith-inclusive' family.

We are soft-hearted and have aloha, respect, compassion for others, and we don't like to see anyone suffering.''' ,'''Hopefully the presence in Congress of an American who happens to be Hindu will increase America's understanding of India as well as India's understanding of America.''' ,'''If we want to change this culture of hate and bigotry, every one of us must stand up and speak with one voice to condemn it, because an attack on one of us is an attack on all of us.''' ,'''The divisiveness that threatens the fabric of our nation - whether due to race, religion, political ideology, gender, sexual orientation, or other - must end.''' ,'''We must remember that this nation was founded by people fleeing religious persecution, risking everything to find a place to be free to worship as they chose or not to worship at all.''' ,'''To maintain order after Assad's fall would require at least 500,000 troops in a never-ending occupation.''' ,'''These days, it's often women in uniform - moms, wives, even grandmothers - who deploy and leave their families behind.''' ,'''No matter where you're from, no matter what religion you practice, your ethnicity, race, or anything else - what is it that can bring us together as people? It is, what we call in Hawaii, aloha... sincere, deep love and respect for other people as children of God.''' ,'''Let's care for the land and water, heal our cherished planet, and promote wellness for all of her people. Water is life. Let's protect the natural resources that our lives depend upon.''' ,'''Every single American deserves to be treated equally by their fellow Americans and under the law.''' ,'''Sadly, the system in this country is rigged in favor of wealthy elites who have purchased tremendous influence in our government.''' ,'''Growing up here in Hawaii, I loved swimming, surfing, and having fun in this paradise we are lucky to call home.

I was one of the few soldiers who were not on the mandatory deployment roster - close to 3,000 Hawaii soldiers were.''' ,'''While in the Middle East, I saw how quickly religious sectarianism and bigotry can lead to the disintegration of a country - how leaders manipulate people to fear others who are different, who look different, or who have different beliefs.''' ,'''Hoping to garner the support of the American people, proponents of regime-change wars routinely cite humanitarian concerns to justify military intervention in foreign countries. But here is the reality: As a direct result of our intervention in Iraq and the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, human suffering increased dramatically.''' ,'''We need to end our country's counterproductive regime change war policies that have undermined our national security, destroyed so many countries, and taken so many lives. We must instead focus on investing in and rebuilding our communities right here at home.''' ,'''The Taliban didn't attack us on 9/11 - Al-Qaeda did. That's why I and other people joined the military - to go after Al Qaeda. Not the Taliban.''' ,'''When I walk around my neighborhood, the grocery store, or the farmers market, I don't see Democrats or Republicans, Progressives or Conservatives. I see my brothers and sisters - living, breathing human beings with diverse and complicated stories, views, and desires that can't be packaged neatly in a box.''' ,'''We have to put an end to the culture of selfishness and corruption that allows greedy Wall Street banks and executives to rip off working people without any consequences.''' ,'''Our actions to overthrow secular dictators in Iraq and Libya, and attempts now to do the same in Syria, have resulted in tremendous loss of life, failed nations, and even worse humanitarian crises while strengthening the very terrorist organizations that have declared war on America.''' ,'''One reason I'm grateful to call Hawai'i home is that the people of these islands embrace diversity and celebrate the colorful fabric of race, ethnicity, and religion that make up our people, place, and culture.''' ,'''My mom was a practicing Hindu, and my dad was a Catholic who practiced yoga meditation and karma yoga. My earliest memories are of the bright colors, beautiful sounds, and fragrant aromas of both Christian and Hindu celebrations.''' ,'''People in the Middle East, people everywhere, want peace.

If that earns me enemies in Washington or at the State Department, then so be it.''' ,'''As a soldier, I stand ready to serve and protect and defend this country. And as a soldier, I know the cost of war. And as president and commander-in-chief, I will end these regime-change wars.''' ,'''The cause of peace is too great for us to allow political disagreements or partisanship to stand in our way.''' ,'''Disadvantaged communities are among the most vulnerable to climate change.''' ,'''If we want to preserve the foundation of our democracy, it's vital that we find common ground that allows us to work for the greater good of this nation.

How can we have a close relationship if decision-makers in Washington know very little, if anything, about the religious beliefs, values, and practices of India's 800 million Hindus?''' ,'''I am a practicing Hindu and have made no secrets about it.''' ,'''I chose to take the oath of office with my personal copy of the Bhagavad Gita because its teachings have inspired me to be a servant-leader, dedicating my life in the service of others and to my country.''' ,'''I am deeply honored and humbled to represent the people of Hawai'i and will continue to do my best to bring the spirit of aloha to our nation's capital.''' ,'''The American people are sick of our failed regime change wars.''' ,'''The best way to honor our troops, the less than 1% of our country's population who voluntarily put their lives on the line in service to our country, is by making sure that when they are sent into combat, it is the last option, not the first, and that the mission is worthy of their great sacrifice.''' ,'''We have to understand that in this country, it's unacceptable for anyone to be sick and in need of care and not able to get that care simply because they don't have enough money.''' ,'''Nothing is more important to me, and nothing was more important to our founding fathers, than freedom of religion.''' ,'''When a person thinks, I am a Christian, this other person is a Muslim, therefore he is my enemy, or I am a Muslim, this other person is a Hindu, therefore she is my enemy, they reveal their own lack of spiritual depth. No religion teaches this, and any understanding of any religion that adopts this divisive attitude proves itself false by doing so.''' ,'''I believe we can make progress on bringing true equality and fairness back to our government if we continue to work together and make our voices heard.''' ,'''I feel it is my duty to take every single opportunity I get to advocate for peace, no matter the circumstances of those meetings.''' ,'''This commitment to equality and justice for all are the ideals that our country was founded upon and what we continue to aspire to as people. We cannot be complacent, and must vigilantly affirm this again and again, as bigotry and hatred have an insidious way of seeping into our society.''' ,'''The best of our nation is exemplified by our nation's veterans who embody what it means to put service above self. Who have sacrificed their own personal interests out of a greater love for our people and our country.''' ,'''Every person has the freedom to choose to give their heart and give their life to God or not. You can't force someone to love God - or to love anyone.''' ,'''It's when we care for each other - choosing inclusion and love over division and hatred - that this great country is at its greatest.''' ,'''What I'm saying is it is our responsibility to exercise due diligence, to ask the tough questions, to get the evidence before we make those very costly decisions about how and when and where our military is used.''' ,'''Unfortunately, sometimes our leaders, for their own political purposes, want us to think in terms of categories and groupings. Our group vs. this group vs. another group. This must end.''' ,'''When I deployed to Iraq with my fellow soldiers, putting our lives on the line for our country, no one in the media questioned our patriotism because of our religion.''' ,'''Each of us wants to be free. But if we want to be free, we also need to appreciate that others also desire the same thing.''' ,]
