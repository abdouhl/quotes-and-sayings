- I think my biggest flaw is my insecurity. I'm terribly insecure. I'm plagued with insecurities 24/7.
- When I first moved to New York, I wanted to be a dancer. I danced professionally for years, living a hand-to-mouth existence. I never tapped into nightlife; all I knew was dancers. We went to bed early and got up early and went to free concerts at the Lincoln Center and Shakespeare in the Park.
- I wouldn't live in Chicago cause it's too conservative, aside for the fact that Oprah Winfrey lives there.
