- I think a lot of people don't understand how deep AI already is in so many things.
- Technology is a continuum. It's constantly getting lower-cost and easier to use, and you see that, and that's true with our company.
- I couldn't imagine a more incompetent politician than myself.
- If someone asks me what cloud computing is, I try not to get bogged down with definitions. I tell them that, simply put, cloud computing is a better way to run your business.
- You look to Google, you see this incredible world of information, you see the advertising, but you also get Google Analytics. And Google Analytics coupled with Salesforce's sales and service and marketing means that both of our customers are going to have customer insights that they've never had before. That is really exciting.
- Nothing is more important, certainly during these times of artificial intelligence, than our public education. And as it continues to grow and evolve, I think you and I know this is going to be critical that we are constantly training and retraining and creating these next-generation jobs.
- I mentor a lot of CEOs and entrepreneurs, and when I see that product is the number-one thing, the only thing that matters, that's a real red flag.
- In business, we say that people overestimate what you can do in a year and underestimate what you can do in a decade. This is true in philanthropy as well.
- I love software and I love technology.
- Although I loved working on technology - I've always been a computer geek at heart - my professors encouraged me to get a real-world job working with customers.

- This idea that we can take hundreds of thousands, which we've done so far, and scale it to millions and move them into a new workforce, this is really critical because Salesforce is a platform.
- I always knew I wanted to be an entrepreneur. I started my own software company in high school and went to college to study entrepreneurship.
- You can do things in every part of the world. You can do things in every discipline. You can do large things, you can do small things. But it takes a while to figure out what you actually want to do. And it changes. As you change your interests and desires in philanthropy change, I think you have to be open to that change.
- I think everybody understands mobility because everybody's got a cellphone and lots of apps and seen how they've moved off of PCs and onto mobility.
- Journalists immediately think of me as a resource for a quote or comment because they know that I will be available to offer fresh insight and meet their deadlines.
- Technology's always taken jobs out of the system, and what you hope is that technology's going to put those jobs back in, too. That's what we call productivity.
- Businesses cannot be extricated or disintermediated from the communities they serve. Businesses who do that will do that at their own peril. They will draw fire. And companies who are integrated will be lauded by their communities and not draw fire.
- Presentation skills are key. People who work for you represent your brand. You want them to present themselves - and represent you - in a certain way.
- When I look at the next set of technologies that we have to build in Salesforce, it's all data-science-based technology. We don't need more cloud. We don't need more mobile. We don't need more social. We need more data science.
- I like to be in locations that I kind of feel are very creative, that stimulate me in a creative process.
- A lot was happening in A.I. But I also realized it wasn't clear what Salesforce's role in A.I. was. That's when we started acquiring quite a few artificial intelligence companies, maybe a dozen.

- In school all I wanted to do was build technology. That's what I loved.
- The antidote to inequality is equality. The question is how do you achieve equality? I believe that, for business, which is where I can speak, we have to shift from shareholder maximization to stakeholder maximization.
- I think everybody understands how important the cloud is.
- I think the most surprising thing about giving is it takes a while to find out what you're really interested in and what you really want to do.

- I have failed a lot in my philanthropy, where I will make philanthropic contributions and they just won't be effective.
- What part of media doesn't need to connect with their customers more smartly?

- The only constant in the technology industry is change.
