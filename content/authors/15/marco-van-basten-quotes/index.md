- Cruyff was one of the best, he was my hero and my example. He was a star at the same time as George Best, fantastic to watch. I knew him later on, he became my trainer, my adviser, my team-mate, my opponent. It was easier for me to play with him than to speak to him.

- I think it can be very interesting watching a game without offside.

- Ronaldo is a great player. But those who claim that he is stronger than Messi do not understand football or are in bad faith.
- My first dream as a young boy was to be a gymnast and my first memory of football is of watching Ajax win the European Cup in 1971. It was a time when a great philosophy was being developed at Ajax, making rounded players who were there as a complete team rather than as 11 individuals.

- Football should be a pleasure.

- When you accept the captaincy, you accept the responsibilities that come with it.
- For quality and excitement the Champions League is better than the World Cup.
- I have worked with Johan Cruyff, with Rinus Michels, with Arrigo Sacchi and with Fabio Capello.
- Xavi has won the Champions League three times, the European Championship twice and the World Cup. He's a real football player, a man who focuses on his football, hard work and training instead of the glamour, and that is why he has stayed at such a high level for so long.
