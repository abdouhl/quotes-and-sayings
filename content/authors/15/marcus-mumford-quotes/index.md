- I don't even call myself a Christian.
- I think it was T.S. Eliot who talked about good poetry being felt before it's understood. I believe that. There are some bands where I love their lyrics but I don't have a clue what they're on about.
- I'm very English, and we don't talk about emotions publicly.
- It's a unique thing to stand in front of a crowd and sing your songs.
- The authenticity thing has never been an issue for me.
- A lot of the time writers are just sponges... for what's around them, and so books are helpful for focusing your mind and literally putting it into words.
- I'd love to write a country album with Adele.
- Every band I've come across has read more than I have.
