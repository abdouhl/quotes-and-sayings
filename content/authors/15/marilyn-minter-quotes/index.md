- I'm from the South; there's been such progress since I was young, with racism, with feminism. The environment is next.
- Any artist who sticks around in the public awareness for more than 20 years usually has something unique to say.
- My entire philosophy of teaching is based on the notion that when an artist finds a certain process really effortless, that's probably what he or she should choose to do. So often, students take the opposite tack; they have no use for the skills that come easily to them.
- I was there when they shut down the Pentagon; I've been going on protest marches my whole life... And now, this fight against controlling and policing women's bodies feels like a war.
- Success can be destructive to the creative process. I say it all the time: success is as dangerous as total failure.
- Threads of Rosenquist and Warhol are all through my work. But I'm messier - and wetter. It's the female perspective. I'm not as tidy, and they were both very tidy.
- I've always tried to be very seductive. I want the paintings to draw you in. But I don't want to just glamour you. I want to make an image of the time we live in and reflect it back.
- The fashion world is 10,000 times more superficial than the art world. Fashion people are so much crazier than art-world people. They are constantly trying to leech from the art world, but they will never be able to do what we do.
- I remember hearing a radio segment, while working in the studio, that detailed how officials were trying to systematically - and quietly - eliminate individual Planned Parenthood centres throughout the country by tweaking state laws so that it'd be harder and harder and harder for them to operate - and it was working. I was incensed.
- The fashion world tells me how much they love my work, but they don't hire me very often. Tom Ford did, and he hated it. Naturally, he wanted to Photoshop away the imperfections, which is perfectly understandable. They want their vision.
- I meditate. Just counting my breath. Before I do anything, really.
- I'm an animal-rights person, actually. Big time.
- I don't follow anybody. I just flip through whatever Instagram sends me. I like to keep my algorithm pure, so I only ever like pictures of art. It's a rabbit hole for me because I'm a total voyeur.
- I work in a studio with lots of young people, most of whom are my former students. We delight in trading YouTube videos! We all stop working to watch them. I'm totally addicted to anything with kittens and puppies, but 'Very Scared Kid' is one of my favorites.
- I always say, 'Perfection is the flaw. It doesn't exist.' I saw something somewhere about 'porcelain pores' - you're not even allowed to have pores anymore!
- I love the idea of making images of the parts of the body that we all have but that no one pays attention to, like the soft area underneath your nose.
- I really don't own any jewelry. I paint it, but I'm not a consumer. I buy art - that's all I want.
- I still don't feel like I've made it. I can't imagine ever feeling like I've made it.
- People of my generation are used to collecting the heroic boys. And they're used to paying a lot of money for heroic boys. I don't make a third of what a guy would make.
- In the late '80s, I think my vision was chasing people out of the room. Nobody else thought like this. I was really this pro-sex feminist.
- When I see an artist whose work I like at a party - I'm old now, so I can do this - I go right over and tell them how much I like their work. Instantly, I'm on their side. The act of saying it takes away the competition. The act of saying it makes me not hate them anymore, because they're good.
- I've been playing hand-held video games since 1995. Its my way of training my brain.
- I've always worked from images that already exist in our culture, and I just tweak them - I photograph my vision/interpretation of things that already exist, and I take it to the extreme. And then I make paintings or videos.
- Feminism is the best movement that's happened in the 21st century, and it benefits everyone.
- I am an illusionist. That's why I create art.
- I feed off the fashion world like a parasite.
- When Photoshop came around, I thought I'd died and went to heaven. When I hear artists say, 'Oh, the good old days' or 'I'm old school,' I just want to puke. There's no tool I won't use.
- Planned Parenthood is being mentioned by the Republican Party more than ISIS. I think Trump is insane. I don't think you could have a normal conversation or even convince him. I think the ego is just about Trump. It's not about the issues at all.
- I think I might be hitting the zeitgeist. All around you, you're looking at beautiful people that have been turned into robots. Maybe the eye is craving a little upper lip fur.
- If you really have something to say, sooner or later it will be heard. And if you're lucky you'll still be alive.
- The thrill of a photo-realist painter is if you get really close to the painting, it looks just like a photograph. Whereas in my case, if you get close to my paintings, they totally fall apart - so I'm about as far from a photo-realist as it gets.
- Art about art and backstory has taken over visual pleasure.
- My work is about the world I live in. So, I sort of make a picture of my life or our lives. I'm always looking for something that is overlooked, so I need to constantly be aware of what's going on.
- We can't shame women for trying to be beautiful. That's so mean and unfair. But there's a part of me that thinks it's really sad, too. It's very complicated.
- Brenda Starr is how I learned to draw. I copied her. I admired her. She had a career.
- I really believe that women run the art world.
- I think there's still this huge glass ceiling for women owning sexuality. And especially young women. If you're an old lady like me, I can do anything now.
- I watched artists who blew up before me become parodies of themselves. I wasn't listening to people when they told me that I had nothing to say, and I can't listen to people now when they tell me I'm the bomb, even though I want to.
- All my work is about how it feels to look.
- I'm a voracious reader. I want information, all kinds - Internet, books, magazines.
- Only be an artist if you have no choice!
- You know when women look their best? When they're in love.
- I like working with women who own their own power.
- I always knew I had something to say even when nobody else wanted to listen.
- I've been supporting Planned Parenthood all my life. I've even used it myself, back when I had no money. It's where I got my birth control. During college, every one of us got support from them.
- I sort of feel like if you're slightly marginalized, you're hungrier, and you can take more risks and be more playful.
- I take things that already exist and just push them.
