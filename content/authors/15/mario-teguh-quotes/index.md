- Lead yourself whenever your boss' leadership deteriorates. When your boss doesn't praise what you do, praise yourself. When your boss doesn't make you big, make yourself big. Remember, if you have done your best, failure does not count.
- I am a person who always tries not to be easily influenced by position or achievement. I thank God for the fact that I can share more kindness and a good quality of life through the popularity. Not for the popularity itself.
- Never make a decision when you are upset, sad, jealous or in love.
- I always tell my clients to be tough, to be strong. Never weaken yourself. I believe God favors only strong persons.
