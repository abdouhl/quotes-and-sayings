- My family background has always been very supportive. They're going to be there for me no matter what.
- 'Luchadores, mil mascaras'... a thousand masks. I see a lot of those in Jets colors. And then the Hispanic fans of other teams, they'll wear them in their colors. And they're like, 'You're our guy, Sanchez, but I'm a Steelers fan.'
- I feel good, I feel good. Our training staff, they're the best.
- As competitive as I am, I want to get the best of a play and make sure to use it's full potential even when things break down. But sometimes you need to just say 'uncle' and let it go and avoid a hit.
- My family and I took visits to each and every school and listened to each coaching staff. I felt the most comfortable with and really excited about playing at SC. Being close to home in one of the best offensive systems is paying off now as I'm making the jump to the pros.
- Working your core always, your foot speed, jumping rope, push-ups and sit-ups - things like that are really important. Those things will pay off more than just doing what a bench press will.
- To mark the 10-year anniversary of 9/11, I wanted to launch an FDNY shirt that pays tribute to the brave first responders who, like my father, risk their lives in the line of duty on a regular basis. All of the proceeds raised from the sale of the T-shirt benefit the New York Police & Fire Widows' & Children's Benefit Fund.
- The Latino community, they're some of the most loyal fans on the planet.
- As the member of a firefighter family myself, supporting the widowed families of rescue workers is an important, personal cause of mine.
- As far as the Jets go, I'm competing to play. It will be a heated competition between Kellen and me, and I'm excited about that; I will do it in a respectful way. I have the utmost respect for him because he's a great player. Whatever's best for team will be best for the team and the coaches will decide.
- There's a handful of situations already in two games - some hits I don't need to take - and I'm taking them because I'm stringing out the play.
- I just banged it a little bit on a helmet. And you know, if you get your throwing motion and momentum going at a helmet it makes it hurt a little more and it freaks everybody out because it's your throwing shoulder, but honestly, it feels great.
- Lifting weights is obviously important, because you want to be strong and fast and all of that, but it's not one of those things you gotta go and try to bench as much as you can every day. A bench press isn't going to help you throw a 15-yard out or a deep comeback. It's not about that. It's about training right.
- I was a competitive guy growing up.
- I'm thinking, 'Man, there's this whole other group of people that are attached to me because of my last name and my family's roots.' That's pretty cool. That's special, that's a lot of power and it's important.
- The chance of winning a Super Bowl in a city like New York, there's nothing like it. Once you win one, you get that bug to win another one, that edge.
- It's a tremendous honor. It really is a privilege, not just a right. You're in the NFL and you wear the shield now. It means the world to me; it really is a special feeling, and my family's gotten a real kick out of it.
- It means the world to me to represent the Hispanic community.
- That's part of the reason Rex drafted me, because I value this job. It's my life. If somebody wanted to take that away from me, it's personal.
