- Always, I'm a competitor. Growing up, it's the same thing. I always wanted to compete and show how good I am. I did it in college to get the No. 1 pick, and now that I'm here, I'm going to keep getting better to prove I'm one of the best guards and players in the league. It's a long, slow grind, so I'm just taking my time every day.
- At first, I was thinking about just getting to the NBA, just watching the NBA, being one of the All-Stars in the NBA.

- College, by far, was the best time of my life. Just being able to go there right now and not worry about paying bills and all that and just having fun.

- I wear hats and hoodies so it's kind of hard to see me. I stay low-key. That's the way I am.

- When I'm on the court, I feel at peace, really. It feels like my home. I'm always thinking of something creative to do, like trick shots or something like that. It's just something about the basketball court that touches me; it makes me feel like nothing is wrong on the court.
- Right now, I've really started to just go out there and showcase my full ability, but it's going to be a surprise. That's why you don't see me on social media right now posting videos of me shooting and everything: because I want it to be special when I come back. I want to have people guessing, so it's going to be good.
- I'm OK with failing. You've got to fail in life in order to get better. I'm going to be fine.

- I always come out playing like I'm the underdog on the court. I never want anyone to catch up to me; that's just how I look at it.
