- Well, maybe at home I don't have the best image.
- I don't think it's a low point being in the finals of the French Open, three points away from the victory.

- I still speak Czech with my parents because I was born there.
- Right now I like baseball, hockey and tennis players. And horseback riders.
- We had a poster of the Davis Cup in 1986. It was in Prague, the Czech Republic against Sweden, and we went to watch, so I got the poster. You couldn't get all the posters. You were lucky if you got one.
- No, because I think I have a reason to believe in myself and I think I'm also pretty confident about who I am and what I'm doing and it might be because I'm still at the top too.

- I have good anticipation, and good reaction to the the ball because I've played so many matches in my life.
