A chilling thought. Or funny.''' ,'''What did our nation ever do to provoke these madly vicious enemies? What is seen as injustice in one place is seen as just requital in the other.''' ,'''The theory of cultural bias... is the idea that a culture is based on a particular form of organization. It can't be transplanted except to another variant of that organization.''' ,'''Enclave life becomes very tense, Even when they do elect a leader, the factions remain, with the threat of splitting off.''' ,'''Yes, disappointment over perceived unfairness, injustice, promises not kept, tends to go hand in hand with increasing prosperity. Expectations are dashed. What can I say!''' ,'''Inequality can have a bad downside, but equality, for its part, sure does get in the way of coordination.''' ,'''Real equality is immensely difficult to achieve, it needs continual revision and monitoring of distributions.
