- Australia is so cool that it's hard to even know where to start describing it. The beaches are beautiful; so is the weather. Not too crowded. Great food, great music, really nice people. It must be a lot like Los Angeles was many years ago.
- I like to go to parties where I know everyone. How are you going to have fun with people you don't know?
- I find it's better to focus on what's in front of you and to keep putting one foot in front of the other.
- I feel like when I carry a bigger bag, it looks like it's a huge bag because I'm really tiny. But I do think it's important to have the space that you need, because we throw everything in our bags at all times. I think every woman does.
- We did many of our own stunts. We had our hands full. In fact, the roles were physically demanding.
- I run around my house naked with heels all the time. It's so funny.
- We were never thrown into the situation in the middle of our lives, but grew up doing it. This is all we know, and some people who were thrown into it don't really know what to do or how to react and this is just kind of natural for us.
- I love to play games. I really like football, and I also like to ride horses.
- I grew up horseback riding. That was my passion. I didn't start shopping until about 16 or 17, when I could drive myself to stores and explore on my own.
- We were always surrounded by people who knew us very well and cared about us.
- There are just some really beautiful people in the world. When you're walking down the street, or you're at a restaurant, someone catches your eye because they have their own look. It goes way beyond what they're wearing - into their mannerisms, the way they smile, or just the way they hold themselves.
- We've always been fans of a good mystery; we think all kids are, and there weren't any good mysteries out there these days for kids, so that's why we decided to do them.
- I usually do get the tomboy parts in the movies, which is kind of like me, but not totally. I like to shop as much as Ashley, but she is a little more of a girlie-girl than me.
- I think we have the same goals in mind. We are not planning on just all of a sudden taking a film and separating. Hopefully one day she can direct me in something, or I will direct her. Or we'll produce a movie under our company's name.
- I am a really bad test taker. I can get straight As in school, but I get nervous on test.
- I look at old photos of me, and I don't feel connected to them at all. I would never wish my upbringing on anyone... but I wouldn't take it back for the world.
- When I was young, clothes were really just about what fit, because Ashley and I were so tiny. So I understood fit before I understood style.
- We played soccer a lot with our friends and at school. We weren't on an official team or anything, but we'd definitely be up for it in gym or in after-school pickup games where we live.
- We have been roommates our entire lives. We just bought a place together.
- When I was younger, on weekends, my mom would make us pancakes with our initials on them and then a tiny cup of coffee. I remember at 10 sneaking my own coffee and pouring a ton of sugar in and going up to the playroom and drinking it.
- Any time that we have time to take off, we love being home.
- We had to decide: Do we want to do Saturday Night or go to our Senior Prom? We opted for Saturday Night Live.
- Our career is a dream. I mean, we get to act, travel around the world, and meet cool people. What's not to love!
- When you're walking down the street, or you're at a restaurant, someone catches your eye because they have their own look. It goes way beyond what they're wearing - into their mannerisms, the way they smile, or just the way they hold themselves.
- Just as we have had great working lives, we have also had good personal lives. For instance, we have made school our number one priority. We have been in school our entire lives with kids our own age. We guess that's pretty regular.
- I'm definitely bicoastal, but I have to say, it's easier to live in New York than in L.A. I feel like people respect other people's space a bit more here.
- I made the decision to take acting seriously after high school.
- How can you be organized when you're in Times Square?
- We get along really well, but TV and film aren't reality. We're best friends, but we do have our fights!
- I want to go to culinary school because I love cooking. One day I'd love to open up a restaurant or cafe.
- When I was in my freshman year at college I took some acting classes and found that I fell in love with it again.
- I was never challenged when it came to acting as a youngster. I sort of just did whatever was given to me without asking questions. I didn't really understand why I enjoyed it or why I did it.
- I love getting amazing jackets, because you can wear your pajamas underneath and everyone's like, 'Oh, fabulous jacket,' and I'm like, 'You should see what's underneath!'
- We kinda look at this as the second or third chapter of our lives. After college, most people figure out what they want to do with their lives. But we already know what we want to do in the future and that is to continue to further our business goals.
- I'm definitely bicoastal, but I have to say, it's easier to live in New York than in L.A. I feel like people respect other people's space a bit more here. Everyone has the right to that freedom, right? Everyone has that right. It's freezing in New York right now. In L.A., it's sunny. But I would choose freezing over being followed.
- I look at old photos of me, and I don't feel connected to them at all.
- I would never wish my upbringing on anyone... but I wouldn't take it back for the world.
- We've played producers almost our entire lives in everything else we've created. But when working on a feature and even dealing with something like Warner Bros. or another production company, or other details that you can worry about - we definitely learned a lot.
- If they're going to write a story they're going to write the story whether it's true or not.
- I still read scripts, and if something great comes along, that's great... but this is my day job. The Row is where I go every day.
- Some people are natural beauties, some have great style, but sometimes it comes from talent. Take Kate Winslet: I was listening to her speech at the Golden Globes. That woman has so much intensity. She's amazing to watch and to listen to. With some people, it can even be their voice that makes them attractive.
- I like change. I've never really had much consistency in my life, you know, from everyday work to my living situation to whether or not I'm going to be in L.A. The one constant thing in my life is my friends and family, which is all I need.
- I get extra time to take the test because of my ADD. Everybody's brains works differently and I just need longer for things to register.
- Our ultimate goal is to stay in business. We are not here with a specific plan. That's kind of how our entire career has evolved. We will figure things out as we go along.
- I never went shopping. That wasn't my thing. I grew up horseback riding. That was my passion. I didn't start shopping until about 16 or 17, when I could drive myself to stores and explore on my own.
- I think it's really important to be able to talk when something's wrong. I learned at a really young age that if you don't talk about it, it can drive you insane.
- I think one day I want to be on the other side of the camera-maybe directing.
- We will probably always be in business together.
- I love to learn; I really do. We'd study something in class, and I'd take it outside of class and become, like, obsessive and just research everything.
- I wear weird things sometimes. I like to drink coffee. Neither of those things have anything to do with who I am.
- I learned how to play the drums. When we were in pre-production, when we were still in LA, I had a couple of drum lessons and then some in Toronto. I got the one beat down and that was it.
- Me and Ashley feel like we're totally different.
- We've read scripts, and I think right now we are just focusing in on school.
