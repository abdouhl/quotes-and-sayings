- If someone asks me a question, that says they appreciate what I do and that's nice. And I know what it was like when I was a kid to want to interact with a top player.

- After I lost the first set, I was like, 'OK, I need to get help because I can't play this way.'
- I'm a different person off the court than I am on the court, where I'm very competitive, a perfectionist, and I can be hard on myself sometimes. Off the court, nothing really bothers me. I'm easy-going.
- My life off the court has changed. I'm feeling good inside, so I guess it shows on the outside too.
- I definitely need clarity.
- It's been interesting. I went through a period where a lot of people would recognize me, and then when I had injures and my ranking dropped, not as many people did.
