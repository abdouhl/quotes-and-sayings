quotes = ['''Women are like dogs really. They love like dogs, a little insistently. And they like to fetch and carry and come back wistfully after hard words, and learn rather easily to carry a basket.''' ,'''It's the safety valve of middle life, and the solace of age.''' ,'''I never saw a lawyer yet who would admit he was making money.''' ,'''A little work, a little sleep, a little love and it's all over.''' ,'''I hate those men who would send into war youth to fight and die for them; the pride and cowardice of those old men, making their wars that boys must die.''' ,'''The writing career is not a romantic one. The writer's life may be colorful, but his work itself is rather drab.''' ,]
