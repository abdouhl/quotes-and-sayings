- Once your career is over, then you don't have to live up to anything.
- If you stay by the book, it's not always going to work. You've got to venture off a little bit. But you can't get too reckless, either.
- You try to take advantage of taking control of the game when you know you may have guys on base and counts aren't in your favor or whatever. You just try to figure out ways to slow the game down to get back to the pace that you want it to be at, to try to get the momentum back on your side.
- I'll get in that habit of throwing the ball over the plate too much. You want to keep it going, get those guys back into the dugout. But it's not a good thing when you're over more than a third of the plate.
- I think I'm constantly trying to grow as a pitcher. You start going out there, you're learning stuff, you're finding different ways to try to get guys out. Trying to be creative.
- Once you start playing 'Call of Duty,' you better watch out, because before you know it, you've lost four or five hours out of your day.
- I seem to play in spurts. Somebody will tell me about a cool game, then I'll run out and play for a bit, but then I'm done.
- In Tennessee, you can live off fast food. It's everywhere... But it's nowhere in San Francisco, and I didn't know how to navigate the city to eat.
- I want to mix, match, take something off, move the ball around.
- It's having the confidence to go out there and say, 'You know what? I need to go out there and throw those pitches where I need to throw them,' and make it as simple as that.
- I got into a bad habit of dropping my elbow and pushing the ball to the plate instead of getting on top of it and using some leverage to get it down in the strike zone or get some depth with the ball.
- One thing the Giants are great at is pretty much leaving you alone and working with what you have. A lot of organizations might try to change guys right away. Not the Giants.
- We don't know, ultimately, if we'll end up in San Francisco, but we're talking about keeping the house. It would be nice to always have a place here.
- We have to be able to go deep in games and save those guys in the pen for down the stretch.
- I've got to be confident in all the pitches I'm throwing so I can throw anything in any count.
- At first, I was stubborn about not wanting to become a city boy.
- I think the bullpen is always a possibility for anyone, but that's not where I plan on being.
- I don't just want to be that guy who throws hard.
- That's what you want to do, is get recognized for accomplishments you've had on the field, not off the field. That's always my goal, to find ways to do that.
- I think you just learn to maybe slow some of the key situations in the game down.
- To be able to pitch in the postseason is great, and to be able to go out there and throw the ball well and help your team win is a great feeling.
- I don't think it's a bad thing at all to get recognized for things that you've done on the field.
- Major League Baseball is doing everything to make the game as clean as possible.
