quotes = ['''Many first-time novelists end up rewriting their first two or three chapters, trying to get them 'just right.' But the point of the first draft is not to get it right; it's to get it written - so that you'll have something to work with.''' ,'''Writing the first draft is like hitting the beach on D Day.
