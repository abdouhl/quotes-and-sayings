quotes = ['''Best, I'd advise, to give up all animal products obtained by cruel methods. There are some fine companies nowadays offering leather substitutes.''' ,'''Factory farming came about from a moral race to the bottom, with corporations vying against each other to produce more and bigger animals with less care at lower cost.''' ,'''Religious people... hold a kind and merciful view of life, the faith of the broken, the hounded, the hopeless. Yet too often, they will not extend that spirit to our fellow creatures.''' ,'''I did attend Catholic schools up to the ninth grade, and I admire much in the Catholic Church.''' ,'''The truth is that at the White House and in Congress, you are as likely to find sympathy for animal issues among Republicans as among Democrats.''' ,'''In the summer or fall of 1974, I read some books about factory farming, and decided that I wanted no part of it.''' ,''''Cost-saver' in industrial livestock agriculture may usually be taken to mean 'moral shortcut.'''' ,'''An environmentalist can oppose factory farming because it's reckless stewardship.

And I hope that more of us will open our hearts to animals.''' ,'''Veal, by definition, is the product of a sick, anemic, deliberately malnourished calf, a newborn dragged away from his mother in the first hours of life. Veal calves are dealt the harshest of punishments for the least essential of meats.''' ,'''Factory farming, like comparable evils throughout history, depends for its existence upon concealment. It depends on people either not noticing or willfully averting their gaze.''' ,]
