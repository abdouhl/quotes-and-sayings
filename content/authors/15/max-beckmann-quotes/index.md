What am I? Those are the questions that constantly persecute and torment me and perhaps also play some part in my art.''' ,'''Painting is a very difficult thing. It absorbs the whole man, body and soul, thus have I passed blindly many things which belong to real and political life.''' ,'''It was so wonderful outside that even the wild senselessness of this enormous death, whose music I hear again and again, could not disturb me from my great enjoyment!''' ,'''I do not weep: I loathe tears, for they are a sign of slavery.''' ,'''I believe that the reason why I love painting so much is that it forces one to be objective. There is nothing I hate more than sentimentality.''' ,'''Painting constantly appeared to me as the one and only possible achievement.''' ,'''I went across the fields to avoid the straight highways, along the firing lines where people were shooting at a small wooded hill, which is now covered with wooden crosses and lines of graves instead of spring flowers.''' ,'''Space, and space again, is the infinite deity which surrounds us and in which we are ourselves contained.''' ,]
