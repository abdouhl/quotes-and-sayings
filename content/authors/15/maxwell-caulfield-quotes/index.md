- I'm always playing these mendacious characters who end up hoisting themselves by their own petard.
- There isn't a single business where anybody feels secure.
- I am beyond thrilled to be hitting the road with 'Singin' in the Rain.' As a huge fan of the original movie, the chance to bring this story to life on stage is something I couldn't pass up, and it'll be great visiting some of the beautiful theatres on the tour; some I've been to previously; some are going to be a brand new experience for me.
- You can work and scratch out a living in the theatre, but, if you want to make money, you've got to hit the road. You've got to play big houses of 2, 3 thousand seaters with your name above the bill, do popular fare and reach out to the audience such as it is.
- I didn't want to be a hero to kids; I didn't think I had that. I just wanted to be popular.
- Not disown my past or upbringing, but I'd admired American actors, really American movie star - particularly the rebel heroes of the '50s.
- Before 'Grease 2', I was called the next Richard Gere, then after 'Grease 2', nobody would touch me.
- I did sing in another film called 'Empire Records' which is a cult film. 'Grease 2' is also a cult film. You either love it or just think the original was better.
