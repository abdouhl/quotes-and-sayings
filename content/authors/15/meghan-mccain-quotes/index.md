- I am often invited to speak at colleges, and whenever I do Q and A's, a question that inevitably comes up is, 'How do you put up with the blogosphere?' It's a valid question, and I don't really know what answer to give. The truth is that I don't know what to do.

- I don't go to journalists' houses and start dishing about anything private.
- I really like working with people who believe what they're saying.
- Much like the Tea Party, Occupy Wall Street's message has gotten wrapped up in stereotypes. The Tea Party was weighed down by the birther movement, and Occupy Wall Street has gotten looped in with hippie culture.
- As I watched on TV the nest of reporters and groupies surround Palin at the Iowa State Fair, I couldn't help but sit back and wonder if she's become the ultimate party crasher for the Republican Party.
- The America of John McCain has no need to be made great again because America was always great.
- I spent almost two years trying to get my father elected president.
- My dad's about character and bipartisanship and something greater than yourself and believing in this country and believing in the fact that we as Americans can still come together, and that's something I grew up in and feeds me every day.
- Hell would freeze over before I would do a reality show. I've been offered everything you could possibly imagine, and it just doesn't interest me. You certainly won't see me dancing on TV.

- The White House isn't the only platform with a voice. ABC has a pretty big voice, too.
- We all know that Sarah Palin loves attention.
- Every day of my life, I come against a conservative who wants me to shut up. I do believe I'm right and they are wrong.
- Twitter is the most impulsive form of social media, but it's still the most celebrated among politicians and pundits within the Beltway, which is curious, since it can destroy any sense of privacy.

- It's no secret that the blogosphere is more vicious on women than it is on men.
- You're nobody unless you have a gay rumor about you. I've been hit on by women from time to time, and it might simplify my life if I were gay, but no.
- The idea of the celebrity politician is nothing new, and depending on one's perspective, either President Obama or Sarah Palin are the country's first celebrity politicians.

- Campaigns are weird animals and innately bring out bizarre road stories.
- I consider myself a progressive Republican. I am liberal on social issues.
- There are people I know who love President Trump and think that he's the greatest thing that's ever happened to America. I understand those people. I'm not shocked by them. I defend their right to love him. But I do think character and rhetoric matter.

- We Republicans need to look at the future instead of living in the past.

- The baby boomers have dropped the ball on their burden of responsibility.
- The America of John McCain is generous and welcoming and bold.

- I make my living talking about serious subject matter, but I'm a weirdo.
- When people tell me that I must get my maverick gene from my father, they are only half right. My father and I both have inherited our rebellious personalities from Nana. She has always lived her life on her own terms, something that was once considered quite scandalous, given the times she grew up in.
- I'm the daughter of one of the most long-standing senators in politics, and I have been given every opportunity that anyone could possibly dream of. I was given those opportunities as a result of the hard work from both sides of my family.

- Come 2012, I am not going to be voting for someone based on who I think would be the most fun to hang out and have a beer with. I am going to be voting for the person that I think will have the best chance of beating President Obama and gaining votes from independents.

- I do believe that unless we start reaching out to minorities and women and honestly start supporting the LGBT community, there is no more future for the Republican party.
- I'm friends with people that probably would describe themselves as socialists and people that are much more conservative than I am. I can always find a middle ground.

- It is really hard not to love Whoopi Goldberg.
- Working on a campaign and running for president should be a visceral, emotional, passionate, and intense experience.

- The infamous political ads like Carly Fiorina's 'Demon Sheep' and Christine O'Donnell's 'I Am Not a Witch' are so confusing, it's almost like they were paid for by Democrats.
- I'm so thankful to Fox News for the chance to be on 'Outnumbered,' but I'm leaving to focus on other things. I have no doubt the show will continue to do well and wish all my friends and colleagues at the network nothing but success.
