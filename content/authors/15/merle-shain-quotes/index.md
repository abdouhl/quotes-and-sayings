- You can employ men and hire hands to work for you, but you must win their hearts to have them work with you.
- Through tattered clothes, small vices do appear. Robes and furred gowns hide all.
- Loving can cost a lot but not loving always costs more, and those who fear to love often find that want of love is an emptiness that robs the joy from life.
- One often learns more from ten days of agony than ten years of contentment.
