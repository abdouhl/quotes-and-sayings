- It's an honor to be brought into the Rock And Roll Hall of Fame and I'm going to show up if I'm invited, you know?!

- I always want harmony within the band. I want it to work.

- In my business, you could be making money one day, and the next day you could be serving up burgers at McDonald's. So if you want to be able to stay on top of your game, you've got to keep with it.
- Oh, I just love playing music.
- I always said to my wife, 'That's for sissies. Girls get facials.' The first time I tried it I said, 'Oh man, what the hell have I been missing all these years.' Let me tell you, I go in there for about an hour and a half, and the girl does my facial and also massages my neck and my arms.

- I can sing, but I consider myself a bass player. I'm, you know, a musician first.
- I'm always the guy that says never say never.
- The best part about Chickenfoot is that nobody needs the money. We've got nothing we need to prove to anybody. We wanted this to be a fun band and when we get in the studio it's just so loose, relaxed, and open.
- You can be a supergroup without having good songs.
- You can only go with the excesses to a certain point; it wasn't always the Jack Daniels bottle. We weren't just a bunch of sloppy musicians on stage drinking; we would critique every show.
- I always had to have music in my cars.
- Probably for drums, a guy I really enjoyed watching is Simon Phillips. I've seen him play with The Who and with Pete Townshend on his own - a really great drummer.

- God, what can I say about Chickenfoot that hasn't already been said?
- It's weird because it almost takes something like Chickenfoot to make me realize why I was playing music in the first place. And that's to have fun.
- It was never so much the heavy metal thunder that got me. I was into players who played with taste and did these walking bass parts. If you can play like that, it really opens up the music. You can't just pound away. After a while it's like, 'So what? What else you got?'
- I drink Jack Daniel's. I drink tequila. But you do it in moderation.

- You know, we're in this business to have fun and entertain.
- I've always loved playing Zeppelin - they were one of my favorite bands growing up.
- I'm the kind of guy who has your back. When you want to go off and solo for ten minutes, I keep that groove going. It's an important job.
- Lead singers, they're their own breed.
- Like music, cooking and more specifically, barbecuing is one of my greatest passions and my sauce is a celebration of these simple pleasures in life. I am thrilled to have my original BBQ sauces featured on Hard Rock's menu, as both embody the true meaning of rock 'n' roll flavor.
- So much of the time people focus on the awesome power of Led Zeppelin, the whole 'Hammer of the Gods' thing, but John Paul Jones, probably because he was a session player, he put a lot of thought into his playing. He didn't just lumber through.
- Jack Bruce really showed me that you could go anywhere with a bass part, and as long as you stayed in time, as long as you held down the groove, the door was wide open.
