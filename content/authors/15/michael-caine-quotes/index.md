- Hollywood is a cross between a health farm, a recreation center and an insane asylum. It's a company town, and I happen to like the company!

- I'm every bourgeois nightmare - a Cockney with intelligence and a million dollars.
- The first thing I'll do if I want to look really crappy is, I don't wear any makeup at all.

- When you're a movie star and you're young, you are always playing someone who's a better fighter, a better lover, a better everything than you.
- If you're a movie actor, you're on your own - you cannot control the stage. The director controls it.
- The greatest luxury is not driving. I didn't own a car until I was 30, and that was a Rolls-Royce, so it was cheaper to insure a chauffeur. I never want to drive again. My mind is always on other things. I hate parking, and I'm very short-tempered and would get road rage, I'm sure.

If we are heartbroken, we don't scream in your face with tears - we go home and cry on our own.
- The American cinema in general always made stories about working-class people; the British rarely did. Any person with my working-class background would be a villain or a comic cipher, usually badly played, and with a rotten accent. There weren't a lot of guys in England for me to look up to.
- If someone is very upper-class, you have a stereotype of him which is probably true. If someone has a working-class accent, you have no idea who you're talking to.

- You have to remember, I never became successful or wealthy till I was 30.
- You can see all sorts of things in film acting if you know where to look and what to look for. One thing I often notice is that the actor is looking for his mark, the place where he has to stand to be in the right place in the shot.

- I won an Academy Award for 'The Cider House Rules,' playing an American.
- When I look in the mirror, I see someone who's happy with how he looks, because I was never one of the handsome Hollywood people. And I've had success as I've gotten older, because I'm able to play characters. I no longer get the girl, but I get the part.

- To me, growing old is great. It's the very best thing - considering the alternative.
- The three actors I admire the most are all dead. Humphrey Bogart, Spencer Tracy and the French actor, Jean Gabin. They're all very natural, sort of masculine without being overly macho.

- My problem was that I was blond. There were no heroes with blond hair. Robert Taylor and Henry Fonda, they all had dark hair. The only one I found was Van Johnson, who wasn't too cool. He was a nice, homely American boy. So I created my own image. It worked.
