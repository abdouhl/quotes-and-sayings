Sincerity with toughness, experience, and understanding of the issue - real understanding, not just academic and intellectual understanding. That takes some courage.
- If we create jobs, it's all for the good.
- If you don't know anybody who is out of work, who needs housing, if you've never taken a call at 2 o'clock in the morning from a neighbor who is running out of heating fuel in the middle of February, then you don't know what you do in a tough situation.
