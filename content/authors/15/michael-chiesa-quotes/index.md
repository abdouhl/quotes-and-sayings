- Whenever I get matched up with a guy, I always look at who beat him and I've got to be better than those guys.
- I'm not the prettiest. I'm not the best, but I win and that's all that matters in the UFC.
- I got as high as being ranked 7th at lightweight and I really believe this deep down to my bones that I was really only fighting to half my potential.
- If you look at my fights, you see I finish a lot. It's just how I like to go and I'm always looking for a way to end it.
- I believe I'm destined to be a world champion and I'm getting closer to what I want. Part of it is developing a championship mentality and I feel I have that now.
- I only want to fight Top 5 guys. I'm here to be a champion.
- I want a shot at being an analyst. I love watching 'UFC Tonight.' I'm very critical of all the new fighters they have come on there.
- I'm the type of guy where I feel like if you throw me in against the guy that's gonna be my hardest match-up, I think that's gonna bring out the best in me, and I know that the best of me can beat anybody on any given day to become the world champion.
- I've always loved the fight with Khabib.
- When you can't do road work for a week-and-a-half, that's really hard on your weight cut.
- I could string together 15 wins in a row and still not get a title shot.
- Obviously winning is what's most important, but I need to show people that I've improved.
- Anytime I've won a fight and asked for an opponent, I've usually gotten it, and that's because it's all well thought-out.
- Looking back in hindsight, I really stunted my growth as a fighter by constantly cutting weight all the time.
- I'm a finisher, but he's still Diego Sanchez. He's a wild man. I'm very blessed to come out with the win.
- I finish every fight. And if I don't finish and go to a decision, I win 10-8 rounds. How many guys do you know in the lightweight division who've had fights where they have gotten two 10-8 rounds scored? Think about it. I'm a winner.
- As time has gone on, I've gotten bigger and bigger. My body composition has changed.
- I think Neil Magny gets picked on a lot because people don't think he is that good. I like the guy a lot.
- All I've got to say is I'm in the top 15, I'm not taking any backwards steps.
- The loss of my dad gave me a lot of inspiration because sometimes I stop and think, 'Would everybody have done the same thing that I did?' It was a very tough thing to cope with. I only went home for less than 24 hours.
- I really feel like going up to 170, I'm going to really be able to show my skill set.
- If you're gonna get punched in the face, elbowed, cut up, busted up, injured, have to cut weight, have to bring yourself to the brink of death to show up the next day and try to put on the performance of your life, you've gotta love it. And if I don't love it, it's just not worth it to me.
- I've won five bonuses in my nine fight UFC career.
- I don't think people realize what those weight cuts were doing to me. It took so much out of me to make 155. I wish I could put into words what it was like, to be able to paint the picture of my weight cuts, but I can't. All I can say is that every fight week was a complete misery.
- Being mentally tough is having to battle those demons and push yourself out of your comfort zone and force yourself to be the person that your mind is telling you you aren't.
- I'm a big guy; people don't realize that.
- Dumb and tough goes a long way in this sport but to be elite, you've got to be smarter.
- I feel like a fight is a season. When you're in the UFC, one fight is the equivalent of a whole football season, so when you lose a fight, the fans only remember you from your last fight, so it's very important to perform well, and to keep winning.
- I had my sights set on Tony Ferguson for a long time.
- There was once a time when I was the hip necklace wearing guy.
- You're not going to win mental warfare with me. I am one of the mentally toughest guys, if not the mentally toughest guy in the UFC.
- In every fight, I have a spot that I could lose the first round. When do the oddsmakers ever like me? But it's not a math equation, it's a fight.
- I'm not here to be mediocre. I'm not in the UFC just to get a paycheck and make a living. That's really not what I'm here for. If I wanted to make money, I would have gotten out of the sport and done something else. I want to be a world champion.
- I get a pit in my stomach every time I think of that last attempt to make 155 for the Anthony Pettis fight. I just get this nasty feeling in my stomach, because no exaggeration, that was one of the scariest moments of my life. I remember that I couldn't stop my body from shaking.
- I'm in this sport to test myself. I want to see how far I can take this thing.
- I've always just been this hairy, wild man.
- I won my fight on 'The Ultimate Fighter,' my dad died the next day and I stayed in the game and won the whole thing.
- I at least have to cut my hair. I can't do the whole man bun, funky long hair thing anymore.
- When I first got into the sport it was all about who could cut the most weight, who could be the biggest on fight night. That's the same era when you're sparring 10 five minute rounds, new partner every two and a half minutes, that era of just really hard weight cutting and really hard full contact training.
- Usually I'm a very instinctive fighter.
- I think the Eddie Alvarez fight is a good fight that makes sense - a couple Italian guys throwing down. I've got nothing but respect for the guy.
- I've always prided myself on being mentally tough, but just because you're mentally tough doesn't mean that what's going on between your ears is always good things.
- I've had a mullet the better half of my whole life.
- I'm not afraid to grapple with anybody in the lightweight division.
- Like every fight, after you make weight, you want to go crazy and eat after you've gone through a camp where you can't do that. So I'd eat pizza and wings and beers.
- I train great outside of camp but then once camp starts, it's just a constant weight cut.
- I've always said that as I've gotten older and come into my prime, when I turned 28 would be my best time.
- I am a nerd about this sport. I know guys' records, who they fought, how they win, who they're married to, where they eat dinner, what kind of car do they drive. I'm a big nerd of the sport, so it would be easy for me to sit in front of a table of guys and just talk about fighting.
- I've got to become 'The ultimate Ultimate Fighter.'
- I feel blessed that I have a tough opponent in Justin Lawrence.
- I've talked to my coaches, and I don't even know if I would go to 165. I might go to 175.
- I was the second guy to submit Jim Miller, so I'm up there in catching guys that have been deemed uncatchable.
- I found wrestling when I was 11 years old. About two years later, I convinced my mom to let me rent my first UFC tape. I was fascinated by the sport.
- I'm around a world-class staff that is pushing me to the limit while making sure I don't break myself, which is something I've had a problem with.
- I know deep down I'm destined to be a world champion and maybe it's to be attained in the most prestigious division in the UFC at welterweight.
- With Masvidal, I dropped him and it's the first time I'd ever dropped anyone in my life. I kind of started to turn the corner after that, and it was just a realization that if my hands were a weakness, it was only because I didn't believe in them. I had the talent to do it.
- My path leads to a world title.
- We're never going to solve weight cutting, we need to just get past that. People are always going to cut weight.
- Colby Covington is a nightmare match-up for me, but I'm ready to walk through the fire.
- I'd love a training camp. But if they walked in the door right now and said, 'Do you want to fight for the title in the next 10 minutes?' I'm out the door, warming up, ready to go.
- If you win one fight in the UFC, you're good. If you win two in a row, you're great.
- My love for mixed martial arts will never waver.
- When you train outside of camp, it's fun, I'm playing around, I'm working hard but I'm having fun. When I get into that camp it's 10 weeks of tunnel vision on that opponent, you're trying to work on your strengths and weaknesses, really trying to get better in different areas before the fight.
- Bar none, hands down, no matter what division I'm in, I am one of the best fighters in the world.
- What if I could just focus on fighting? What would that be like? What would it be like to take advantage of all the resources this place has to offer? Because you're not doing it when you're cutting weight all the time.
- I don't classify myself as a wrestler, I'm a grappler.
- I don't take a guy down just to hold him, I look for damage and submissions.
- I really enjoy the opportunity to face another Ultimate Fighter winner because it doesn't come around that often.
- There's only one guy at 170 that's bigger than me, and that's Darren Till.
- I always want to fight guys that want to test me.
- I know I belong at 170. There is not a shadow of a doubt. This is my division and there's a clearcut path to the title.
- I'm a blue collar guy from Spokane, Washington, who was raised to just be respectful, be a sportsman, and just speak with your performances, and I'm glad that I'm back to my old ways.
- I'm just looking forward to a great fight and just to keep making my dad proud.
- Mario Yamasaki should just crawl in a hole and never step inside of any type of professional mixed martial arts event. He should never officiate, ever again.
- Give Tony Ferguson a title fight. He needs it!
- I had never fought a guy before that I had put on a pedestal the way I did with Carlos Condit. I've got his walkout shirt. He's a former champion. I'm a huge fan. I doubted myself a lot of times.
- I was still part of that trend where it was see how low you can get, get as small as you can get, be the biggest guy in your weight class, and it started to burn me out.
- I think Gilbert Burns is going to become my greatest rival.
- 170 is not a popularity contest. 170 is a working man's weight class where you work hard, you get your rewards whereas at lightweight, it wasn't the same. You could work as hard as you want, win as many fights as you want, and there's no promise what you're going to get out of it.
- My father worked very hard and he never missed a day of work, no matter how sick he was.
- I'm letting my coaches take the reins more. Letting them make the decisions on what's going to be a hard practice, what's not going to be a hard practice and also this weight cutting thing. It's the best decision I've made in my entire career.
- It's never easy to watch. It's never great to see your friend or teammate put himself through hell.
- In the past, I've lacked confidence and sometimes that can show physically.
- Anytime my life has ever thrown me a curveball, I can go back to that and draw a lot of confidence for myself knowing I can persevere.
- Fighting at welterweight, I'm much more active in the gym.
- Going to fight Gilbert Burns while not training jiu-jitsu, I mean, that's just stupid.
- Perseverance doesn't always mean winning and losing. Perseverance means showing up and rising to the occasion and performing.
- I'm not a small guy. I can get up to 205 pounds and be athletic and be in shape.
- I'm a huge lightweight.
- Just do Conor McGregor-Nate Diaz 3 for the 165-pound title. You want to talk about a big fight? That's a big fight. Let's add some weight classes. Let's see more champion versus champion. Let's get some more two division champions.
- I'm not afraid to stand toe-to-toe and throw punches.
- I'm always overlooked.
- I show up to win. I don't show up to hurt a guy. I don't show up with emotion.
- I haven't fought for a while and didn't want a warm-up fight. I wanted to jump right back in the pit and I got what I asked for. I got Anthony Pettis.
- I want to be great, I want to fight the best guys, I want to test myself, I want see what my limits are. I don't think a lot of guys in this sport really have that mentality.
- Cutting weight is always rough, especially for guys like myself that make a significant cut to make a number.
- The beard has gotta stay. That's my staple. I can't get rid of it.
- I feel I've always been a fan-friendly fighter.
- I will be the UFC lightweight champion. Mark my words.
- I just don't throw things against the wall that aren't gonna stick.
