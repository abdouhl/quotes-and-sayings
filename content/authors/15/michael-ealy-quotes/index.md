quotes = ['''I'm actually very good with Home Depot-handy type of paintwork.''' ,'''I wasn't smart enough to read relationship books when I was coming up. I learned everything the hard way.''' ,'''I have two dream roles: One would be a biopic of someone I admire and respect and the other one would be some sort of action drama film similar to a 'Bourne Identity.' I just really want to do an intelligent action drama film.''' ,'''I would love to have a complete family. I'd love to do it all at once. I'd love to be able to give to my children what my parents were able to give to me. And if I'm blessed to be able to do that, fantastic. If I'm not, then life goes on. You have to do the best you can. I do think we have to bring the family back; I do.''' ,'''The first season of a show's always a rollercoaster because nobody knows what they're doing. You gotta rush through the season trying to figure out: What is this show? And who are these characters?''' ,'''I know the commitment that TV requires but it's nice to come to work and have fun.''' ,'''The reality is, because of access to film, you don't have a lot of black people who want to go behind the camera. We raise our children to want to be in front of the camera and shine, and that's on us.''' ,'''There's something very beautiful and compelling about someone who has ambition and someone who knows what they want, but it can get a little frustrating at times, so I understand that. I have sympathy for that.''' ,'''I used to love the 'Star Trek' movies, 'Wrath of Khan' and stuff like that. Loved those movies when I was a kid. And 'Star Wars' obviously was hands-down probably - I mean I had the sheets. I was a big fan of that.''' ,'''For the most part, I meet people who are like 'I really like your work. I'm watching your career. I want to see you do well. Keep doing what you do.' I get that so much, and it's so reassuring. I often wish that so many people, who just work normal jobs, could get a pat on the back as much as I do, because it's very complimentary.''' ,'''As an actor, you tend to draw on your human instincts and your background, what you've gone through as an individual.''' ,'''I personally feel like I do look 28 - I never have seen anyone who told me I looked over 35.''' ,'''I would say that the fan support validated my choices as an actor and... the work ethic and the amount of work that went into that character day in and day out. I think the fan support really validates that and all of the cast and crew that worked really hard to make the world of 'Almost Human' look the way it did.''' ,'''I was the only human in 'Underworld.' I didn't really get the full gauge of what it is to be in a sci-fi/fantasy project. But 'Almost Human' presented that opportunity for me and the fanbase that is in that world at Comic-Con and, honestly, cons all around the world - you can't deny the power of that fanbase.''' ,'''I honestly think I'm just an actor. It doesn't matter the medium. I can go on stage and be happy, I can be on TV and be happy.''' ,'''I feel like I've finally made it as an actor. I've been doing this for years and you don't always make a movie that everybody likes.''' ,'''It's my job to stretch and figure out what I'm capable of, to identify with the character I have chosen to play.''' ,'''You know, a lot of actors I think go into acting for therapy from whatever trauma has affected them as children. But for me, I think I sought out the drama. That's why I like doing what I do.''' ,'''My mom and father are extremely proud. They love it when I don't die. I've done so many movies where I've died that their first question when I book a job is, 'So, are you going to die in this?'''' ,'''I would love to direct but I feel like directing is a whole separate craft and so I tend to respect it as a separate craft that I would need to study first. So, right now I'm still trying to do certain things as an actor and until I get bored of that or I feel completely fed by that then I'll move into directing.''' ,'''You have to have energy at hour 13, at hour 14, at hour 15 - comedy cannot be tired, cannot be lazy. You have to be ready to go; you have to have energy.''' ,'''I was wondering if I could love another child as much as I love my son. And what I realized, within hours of my daughter being born, not only do I love her just as much if not more.''' ,'''Any time you audition and get it, you earned it.''' ,'''The kind of issues that we face as detectives are similar to what the other married couples out there are facing, or the brother and sister, or the brother and brother are facing. Relationships are universal.''' ,'''I would never sign on to a project that was male-bashing, because first and foremost I'm a man... what guy would sign on for that?''' ,'''I love going to see the theatre whether it's a Broadway play or a Russian ballet company.''' ,'''I can't sing, like, I can't saaang. I'm no Luther! That to me is singing. Being able to hit a note doesn't mean you can sing.''' ,'''I always wanted to have 'Bad Boys' on TV. 'Common Law' is reminiscent of my youth.''' ,'''My bank account has let me know that I'm a homeowner. Trust me.''' ,'''Sometimes, something special doesn't live forever. But it can always be forever as long as the fans keep it going.''' ,'''There are people who are blond and blue-eyes who are walking through airports that are terrorists. There are people who look exactly like me who are terrorists.''' ,'''At the end of the day, the last thing I want to do is - well, anything. I just want to sleep. I crash out hard every day at 'Common Law.' I definitely lost a couple years of my life just on the fatigue factor on the first season.''' ,'''I think women should have insight as to how men think. Just like men should have insight into how women think.''' ,'''I think we can continue to do as much protesting as we want. Systemic racism needs to be changed from within.''' ,'''If you look at a lot of people's careers, the first couple of movies, usually, are the most embarrassing.''' ,'''Why aren't there enough black cops out there? We need black cops to come in and educate some of the white cops who have issues.''' ,'''I don't live my life in a social way. I don't put everything out on social media. I don't live that reality lifestyle. At the same time, I've always been private, ever since I was in high school.''' ,'''If I feel like it's a well-written script and if it speaks to me, it's something I want to do. I usually rely on my instincts when it comes to a script.''' ,'''The weightlifting was easy. The diet - no sugar, no salt, no carbs, way too much breast of chicken with no seasoning - that was the hardest.''' ,'''I think there's a difference between making a feel-good movie like 'Think Like a Man' and a feel-good show like 'Common Law.' It's not too heavy, it's not too serious. You just walk away with a smile on your face. I think that makes people somewhat more endearing to you.''' ,'''I've always thought vampires were interesting because they live forever, they're always well-financed, they dress well, you know what I mean? And they're, like, cool. Usually vampire - you've never seen a broke vampire. Have you?''' ,'''For me, it was a big challenge in playing an android that was almost human.''' ,]
