- That's the time I remember as a kid, being so excited to go to the movies. To be part of that now is really an amazing gift.
- Without my experiences on the likes of 'Lost' and 'Alias,' I don't know if I would have survived 'Rogue One.'
- I like to think that I probably have written more World War II music than anyone on the planet after all the 'Medal of Honors' and 'Call of Duties.'
- If you have a bad story on your hands, you have a bad story on your hands, and no amount of score re-working is gonna save that.
- There was a paperwork mishap on 'War For The Planet Of The Apes,' in that the end credits was simply called 'End Credits.' And that's what appears on the album. Once we realised that was out there, we were so ashamed.
- I have tons of drawings of 'Star Wars,' whether it be stormtroopers, Darth Vader, Star Destroyers, or the whole thing.
- My parents loved music, but they weren't musicians. So my musical training as a young kid was limited to piano lessons. I was not the best student; I was awful, never practiced. But I was always interested in just messing around on the piano.
- Life is #1 on the agenda, and #2 is work.
- I always loved movies like 'King Kong' and 'Planet of the Apes,' monster movies, Ray Harryhausen films, all of that stuff. I always loved the music in them, too.
- As an audience member, everyone I talk to is like, 'I'm so excited to see 'Super 8.' I'm so excited to see it.' And part of that is because of his drive to make sure that it stays hidden until the last minute.
- Many film scores try to force an emotion into a story that inherently is not there in the first place.
- I grew up listening to 'Planet of the Apes' and other scores, and it was fun for me because you weren't just listening to those scores, but you were also questioning what you were listening to. What are those sounds?
- My dad gave me his camera, so I spent my childhood making movies with the kids in the neighborhood as actors.
- I used to do puppet shows as a kid - me and my brother would do them - and then any poor soul who came into the house had to sit and watch our puppet shows.
- Filmmaking is hard enough as it is. If you can find a group you love working with, it makes it just a little bit easier.
- The Internet's a crazy place to hang out because it's insane to see so many people doing so many creative things all over the map.
- I grew up listening to every style of music you can imagine, and I have a love for all of it.
- For me, the music is always speaking from the point of view of the characters. Rarely do you score an event.
- Working with Kevin Feige has just been a joy.
- That's one of the neat things about 'Call of Duty.' There are areas in the game where we were able to score the gameplay.
- There's so much fun you can have with your instruments that no one ever taught you.

- When I was 9, I saw 'Star Wars,' and it set me on a path to where I am today.
- On 'Lost,' I write a score and orchestrate it on days one and two; I record it on day three. In animation and film and videogames, you have a little more time to work things through.

- Most television, the music is very much the same from show to show.

- There are a lot of guys who do this job, and they have tons of assistants. They all kind of write together, and for me, it's basically me here in this room, and that's it.
- 'Lost,' at its core, is a science-fiction show. Live music helps lend an air of legitimacy to this otherwise crazy storyline. It makes a big difference.

- We're all inspired by what has come before us, but hope to use the inspiration to create our own. That's the artist's journey. It's a pretty amazing path.
- When I was growing up, every show had live music. Now, almost none have live music. Probably 97 percent of the shows on television are probably synthesized, or mostly synthesized, and that's a shame.
- If you look at my credits, most of them are the same directors over and over.
- It wasn't until high school that I actually started writing. I was in a lot of the school plays and musicals, and there was a lot of down time during rehearsals. I would go into the orchestra pit and mess around on the grand piano.
- I watched 'Land of the Lost' as a kid, you know, incessantly. I loved it. Me and my brother watched it every Saturday.

- 'Lost' is such a thematic show that I'm always afraid that if I know something's going to happen at the end, I'll subconsciously write something in where someone who's astute will go, 'Oh, he used so-and-so's theme: that must mean so-and-so is coming back!'
- You've all seen movies where the music isn't working with the story. And it's either because... the story isn't working itself. Or the composer kinda just wants to write whatever they want to write, not paying attention to the thing.

- I always feel like my writing is consistently influenced by everything I watched and listened to growing up, so it's just this crazy collage of everything, you know.
- As a kid, I would listen to anything that had a live orchestra or ensemble playing, so that covered everything from show tunes to eclectic jazz things to film soundtracks to classical music. They're all inspiring to me.

- Because of John Williams, I began collecting all kinds of film scores. I listened to them when I fell asleep, and it was through my obsessive listening that I learned what all the different parts of the orchestra were. I learnt a great deal from him by just simply listening.
- When artists find other artists that they love to work with, they more than likely will continue to work with them throughout their career.
- I think my writing has an old-fashioned feel to it for whatever reason. I'm just so influenced by the music that I listened to growing up, a lot of it out of the '60s, so it has a natural tendency to feel like it's from another era.
- Hopefully, by the time I do a project, I already have a true understanding and love of what I'm about to do because if I don't, I'm not going to work on that project. I really want to have those connections so I can be truthful to the emotional aspect of what I have to deliver for the story.

- I loved writing 'Lost.' It was like a never-ending opera, in a way.
- One of the things I was never thrilled about with 'Medal of Honor' was that it was non-stop music.
- Scoring animated films, I have the exact same approach and philosophy as I do for a live action. It's all story- and character-driven. I don't care if it's a mouse or Tom Cruise.
