quotes = ['''Without fathers you would have no civilization.''' ,'''All over the world when you test men and women for facial cue recognition, women test... better. It's a negotiation tool.''' ,'''If we create a generation of men who aren't getting an education, that's bad for women.''' ,'''Classrooms keep getting set up more and more around the verbal and less around the kinesthetic and active. They are increasingly becoming environments that favour the girls' brain.''' ,'''Making fun of guys to get them to perform and prove themselves, that's always going to exist. But we have to equally celebrate them and empower them.''' ,'''A mother's job... is very much to hold back the coming of manhood.''' ,'''Father's Day is hopefully a time when the culture says, 'This is our moment to look at who our men and boys are.'''' ,'''There is a great suspicion of saying that anyone, especially a child, is 'the product of destiny,' or 'formed by fate,' or 'predestined for a certain life.' I am suspicious, too, of efforts to cage children or adults in preconceived ideas of who they are or should be.''' ,'''There is no single way to educate.''' ,'''If we want boys to succeed, we need to bring them back to education by making education relevant to them and bring in more service learning and vocational education.''' ,'''Our contemporary society is experimenting with the diminishment of caregivers for children. Some children are raised through crucial stages of life by only one person. This one person, who strives to give the best, may be overwhelmed, busy, trying to raise many children. And even in homes with two parents, many children are essentially alone.''' ,'''I don't think anyone disagrees that male and female brains work differently.''' ,'''A lot of women will be sort of 'competitive like a guy' in the workplace, but then when they go home, they realize that's not fully authentic for them. They would like to have a more expansive or more authentic relationship in the workplace around competition.''' ,'''Most teachers are not trained in how boys and girls learn differently.''' ,'''The human community and individual people are more likely to hurt or undernourish children they think of as 'bodies' to be used. Cultures and people are more likely to raise children to be mere economic interns rather than fully developed humans if they see children as 'bodies' to be forced into certain economic and social molds.''' ,'''Soul development depends on attachment and bonding. Every brain and body is genetically wired to develop itself, but the full soul development of brain and body depends on each child receiving the care of between two and five completely bonded caregivers.''' ,]
