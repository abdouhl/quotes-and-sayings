- I'm no superman.
- I know the type of demons they have to fight and I am going to help them, because it's the only way I can keep them from getting to my family. I have to clean up my friends because they are around my boys. It's upsetting.

- The movie, 'Remember the Titans,' is my favorite movie, staring Denzel Washington. I love the way in this movie the game of football brings those boys together, it unites those boys on that football field. It unites a whole town, black, white, old, young, rich and poor.

- We all want to thank Emmitt for allowing us to enjoy every yard.
- The whole thing means such a great deal for me, and hopefully one day it will be there. But my friends and my family mean a little more. I would rather be helping them, even if it hurts that.
- I am the original... Those are my disciples.
- I understand people have doubts, but I'm totally clean.
- I'm taking T.O., every day... He gives me the whole football field.
