- You can't control what the other athlete is going to do; you can't control anything except for your competition and how you execute the race or how you execute the task.
- I had already been into my professional career for six years and had not won an individual gold medal at the Olympics. There was a tremendous amount of pressure going into 1996 to get it done.
- I don't always do a lot of predicting, but, when I get a really strong feeling about something, I will tell people.
- Life is often compared to a marathon, but I think it is more like being a sprinter; long stretches of hard work punctuated by brief moments in which we are given the opportunity to perform at our best.
