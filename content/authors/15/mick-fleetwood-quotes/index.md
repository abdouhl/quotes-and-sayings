- No matter what - rehearsed, under-rehearsed, over-rehearsed, doubts about rehearsing - the first gig is always the first gig, and you put on your little praying hat, batten down the hatch, and do what you do.
- I think we were damned lucky that our music never went down the drain because we went down the drain, and I think, in truth, there are moments where you could have said we got pretty close, you know.
- I keep fit, I work out, I eat pretty damn well, I don't drink like a fish, and all of those things are tempered with a holistic mind-set that you need to damn well respect the vehicle that you're walking around in.
- I have a reverence for great photography, but I don't consider myself in that league.
- In order to run a great business, you must know that a bunch of really intrinsically unhappy people, that's not a recipe for success. Don't be anywhere you don't need to be; it's just like that.
- Obviously, this is a huge change with the advent of Lindsey Buckingham not being a part of Fleetwood Mac. We all wish him well and all the rest of it.
- Fleetwood Mac has been pretty truthful. Open about what we do. We've always done it from the inside out. Versus being pressured from the outside and changing the inside. And that's our story.
- My template for most songs is 'Is this inspiring?' and with the blues it so often is.
- I really understand what that process is all about and how important it is, especially with young folk and creative folk that love looking for some platform that makes it easier for them to express themselves.
- I have a lot of respect for these rock photographers. You realize that some of them were really led into the inner circles of some of these artists and bands. And you see how those photographs really capture the artist, the moment.
- There are no Kleenex boxes on these loops, just so you know.
- All of us... anyone that's been in Fleetwood Mac, as far as I've been aware, has been seemingly pretty well brought up by their parents: not goody two-shoes - God knows we weren't - but there was a level of civility that the lads in the band were aware of, what is over the brink of decency.
- Fleetwood Mac were really accessible musically, but lyrically and emotionally, we weren't so easy. And it was our music that helped us survive. But all of us were in pieces personally.
- We're all looking for those moments - a relief. That's why people go out and treat themselves.
- To me, the blues is an infection. I don't think it's necessarily a melancholy thing; the blues can be really positive and I think I think anyone and everyone can have a place for the blues. It need not always a woeful, sorrowful thing. It's more reflective; it reminds you to feel.
- I think it's part of how people relate to Fleetwood Mac. In many ways, we've been too open and too truthful about stuff that is really none of anyone's business. I think we were quite naive in the way we related a lot of that truth to people other than ourselves.
- The value of friends has always been a natural thing. I prefer too many to too few.
- I love wearing a lot of color, and I am majorly into scarves. I'm the Beau Brummell of Fleetwood Mac, no doubt.
- If you were to ask me, 'What the hell does a musician have in common with a restaurant?' I would say a huge amount. It's show time every day, it's a team of people, like, running a circus, which is running a rock-and-roll band.
- Life is a glass of wine and having your feet washed - it's a biblical event, might I add. This is part of mankind's story. You are always looking for a moment to take a break.
- John Lee Hooker became a friend of mine and I love all of his work. He was truly an icon. He lived the life. I miss him.
- At last a dream come true. The Instrument of Instruments.
- We're celebrating our sixth year with my Fleetwood's, and in a restaurant, that's a lot.
- That creates the magic, and that's the wonderment of the musical process and how precious that is.
- Kudos to Lindsey, for sure, for us not doing a replica of 'Rumours.'
