- Dad was in the British Army and my mom was in the Royal Air Force, so both of my parents believed in discipline.
- Everything I do is autobiographical in some way. 'Wayne's World' was me growing up in the suburbs of Toronto and listening to heavy metal, and 'Austin Powers' was every bit of British culture that my father, who passed away in 1991, had forced me to watch and taught me to love.

- My father was a very funny man, and one of my strongest recollections is hearing him laugh. He didn't like people who had no sense of humour.

- I really just love making comedies; I love doing characters.

- The message of the movie is to accept who you are and not to succumb to the pressure of what the media tells you is beautiful and what you should be looking like.

- In 1991, my father passed away and I went on a spiritual quest. It was a light one, not too terribly deep because I'm not terribly deep, and neither was my father.

- If I went by all the rejection I've had in my career, I should have given up a long time ago.

- With fame there is a crosswire between intensity and intimacy. You have decoy intimacy, but you are also very much alone.

- And I thought, when I have kids, that's the sort of well told, silly, and fun fairy tale that I would want to take them to. But it was an amazing experience. And I think Shrek is a real classic, a fairy tale classic.
- I had done Shrek as a Canadian and I'm very proud to be Canadian, but I knew I could give more to it.
- I grew up in Toronto and as long as I can remember, as long as there was cable, even those old cable boxes that were wired to the TV, there have been Bollywood movies on Toronto TV.
