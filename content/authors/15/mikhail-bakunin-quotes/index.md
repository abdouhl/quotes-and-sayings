quotes = ['''I am sure that, on the one hand, the Rothschilds appreciate the merits of Marx, and that on the other hand, Marx feels an instinctive inclination and a great respect for the Rothschilds.''' ,'''From the naturalistic point of view, all men are equal. There are only two exceptions to this rule of naturalistic equality: geniuses and idiots.''' ,'''People go to church for the same reasons they go to a tavern: to stupefy themselves, to forget their misery, to imagine themselves, for a few minutes anyway, free and happy.''' ,'''The freedom of all is essential to my freedom.''' ,'''Where the state begins, individual liberty ceases, and vice versa.''' ,'''Thence results, for science as well as for industry, the necessity of the division and association of labor. I receive and I give - such is human life. Each directs and is directed in his turn.''' ,'''Idealism is the despot of thought, just as politics is the despot of will.''' ,'''The first revolt is against the supreme tyranny of theology, of the phantom of God. As long as we have a master in heaven, we will be slaves on earth.''' ,'''Powerful states can maintain themselves only by crime, little states are virtuous only by weakness.''' ,'''I am truly free only when all human beings, men and women, are equally free. The freedom of other men, far from negating or limiting my freedom, is, on the contrary, its necessary premise and confirmation.''' ,'''He who desires to worship God must harbor no childish illusions about the matter but bravely renounce his liberty and humanity.''' ,'''I bow before the authority of special men because it is imposed upon me by my own reason.''' ,'''Freedom, morality, and the human dignity of the individual consists precisely in this; that he does good not because he is forced to do so, but because he freely conceives it, wants it, and loves it.''' ,'''The passion for destruction is also a creative passion.''' ,'''The liberty of man consists solely in this, that he obeys the laws of nature because he has himself recognized them as such, and not because they have been imposed upon him externally by any foreign will whatsoever, human or divine, collective or individual.''' ,'''I listen to them freely and with all the respect merited by their intelligence, their character, their knowledge, reserving always my incontestable right of criticism and censure.''' ,'''I am conscious of my inability to grasp, in all its details and positive developments, any very large portion of human knowledge.''' ,'''From each according to his faculties; to each according to his needs.''' ,'''The privileged man, whether he be privileged politically or economically, is a man depraved in intellect and heart.''' ,'''The communism of Marx seeks a strong state centralization, and where this exists, there the parasitic Jewish nation - which speculates upon the labor of people - will always find the means for its existence.''' ,'''This contradiction lies here: they wish God, and they wish humanity. They persist in connecting two terms which, once separated, can come together again only to destroy each other.''' ,'''A jealous lover of human liberty, deeming it the absolute condition of all that we admire and respect in humanity, I reverse the phrase of Voltaire, and say that, if God really existed, it would be necessary to abolish him.''' ,'''Does it follow that I reject all authority? Perish the thought. In the matter of boots, I defer to the authority of the boot-maker.''' ,'''Anyone who makes plans for after the revolution is a reactionary.''' ,'''If there is a State, then there is domination, and in turn, there is slavery.''' ,'''Therefore, if God existed, only in one way could he serve human liberty - by ceasing to exist.''' ,'''By striving to do the impossible, man has always achieved what is possible. Those who have cautiously done no more than they believed possible have never taken a single step forward.''' ,'''Political Freedom without economic equality is a pretense, a fraud, a lie; and the workers want no lying.''' ,'''A Boss in Heaven is the best excuse for a boss on earth, therefore If God did exist, he would have to be abolished.''' ,'''But I recognize no infallible authority, even in special questions; consequently, whatever respect I may have for the honesty and the sincerity of such or such an individual, I have no absolute faith in any person.''' ,'''Even the most wretched individual of our present society could not exist and develop without the cumulative social efforts of countless generations.''' ,'''The privilege of ruling would be in the hands of the skilled and the learned, with a wide scope left for profitable crooked deals carried on by the Jews, who would be attracted by the enormous extension of the international speculations of the national banks.''' ,'''Look at Christ, my dear friend: His life was divine through and through, full of self-denial, and He did everything for mankind, finding His satisfaction and His delight in the dissolution of His material being.''' ,'''Everything will pass, and the world will perish but the Ninth Symphony will remain.''' ,'''Such a faith would be fatal to my reason, to my liberty, and even to the success of my undertakings; it would immediately transform me into a stupid slave, an instrument of the will and interests of others.''' ,'''To revolt is a natural tendency of life. Even a worm turns against the foot that crushes it. In general, the vitality and relative dignity of an animal can be measured by the intensity of its instinct to revolt.''' ,'''To my utter despair I have discovered, and discover every day anew, that there is in the masses no revolutionary idea or hope or passion.''' ,]
