- I can't put much weight into whether the public likes me because the more important thing is that, as an actor, I can truly say that there's not a single director or actor who I've worked with who'd have a bad thing to say about me.
- For me, I still have feelings for all of my ex-girlfriends. In different parts of my life, I would miss that person. There's something that drew me to that person, and I shared something with them.
- I got into acting my junior year of high school. We got a new hot drama teacher and I was like 'Alright, I'll try drama.'

- I've always felt like I can dance.

- Absolutely, 'Rabbit Hole' gave me a nice first introduction into film acting.
- Respect the person you're with. My philosophy is, if I'm not happier when I'm with you, then there's no reason for me to be with you. I'm happy on my own.
- When I was in middle school, I always did well in school, but teachers either loved me or absolutely hated me.
- Going to high school in rural Florida, we always partied down in the woods. Somebody - one of the rednecks - would leave class and mow a path out to a field, and we'd drive out there. Dude, every party I went to was lit by a bonfire. Acoustic guitar.
- Certain times, I'll choose my words very carefully and maybe come off a little more boring.
- I like talking to people.
- I don't know if there's an actors' slow-pitch softball league I could join. My agency has a team, but they say it would be a conflict of interest for the people they rep to play because I could hit a pop-up and they'd have to drop it on purpose.
- People would probably say my mom raised very confident children, but it comes from a place of being comfortable in your own skin.

- There's nothing I can control about how people see me as a person, but I can control how they think of me as an actor.
- I've been told that having an Instagram account will help me book more roles, get more endorsement deals. It makes you more of a brand. But I'm not interested. I want to build my fan base through movies and movies alone.

- I'm still waiting for my first big Hollywood paycheck... maybe I'll play a superhero.
- 'Footloose' is a fun movie. If you do it right, people should leave wanting to dance.
- I'm the first one out on the dance floor. In college I had to take jazz, ballet and tap dancing, but, before that, it was just social.
- I'm not the kind of person to Google myself, because you'll find whatever you're looking for. If you want to read something that says you're the greatest actor that ever lived, if you want to find something that is pretty hurtful, you'll find it.
- The makers of '21 and Over' have been screening it, and I'm getting a lot of comparisons to a young Vince Vaughn.
- First play I ever did was 'Footloose.' I played the part of Willard when I was 16. I think I wore my drama teacher's jeans and her belt - that's how small I was. I know a lot of Willard's back story from the musical that's not explored in the film. Like he's got this whole relationship with his mama, and he sings this song 'Mama Says.'
- Maybe it's because I came from a small town, but I always did well for myself.
- It's hard to get to the right position, to be somebody who is commercially successful and critically acclaimed. That's the sweet spot.
- When I was in high school, there was 'Superbad' and 'The Girl Next Door' and 'Wedding Crashers' and all these great movies. You hope to be a part of something that's smart, funny and in that Todd Phillips-vein. You want to make something like 'Superbad.' That movie was so good and so funny.
- I used to be very vain about my thumbs. I have fat thumbs. If there's a movie where you see me on the phone, it's not my hands.

- I played music my whole life - piano, saxophone.
- I absolutely do care what people think about me.
- I'm a pretty light-hearted person.
- So I think that in the beginning of your career you're just looking to work. Luckily for me, my first movie was 'Rabbit Hole' and I got to work with incredible people, a Pulitzer prize winning writer, John Cameron Mitchell, and all the actors involved. So it's tough, man, because you want to have credibility.
- I was raised middle-class in a small town. I have all my same friends from high school. I'm close with my family. I'm dating a normal girl. So I want to feel people think I'm a man of the people. Because I feel that way.
- I've played drums in bands since I was 16.
- I grew up in a very small town in Florida, like, 7,000 people.
