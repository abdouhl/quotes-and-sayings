- Writing is a journey of discovery because until you start, you never know what will happen, and you can be surprised by what you do - expect the unexpected!
- I do tend to use watercolors - I love the splatter sort of thing you can do with watercolors.
- Because even very young people are expert readers of pictures, you can convey very complex and subtle messages through pictures that you'd need loads of words to explain. Making a picture book is also a bit like making your own film - and you can make anything you want happen, however impossible!
- I love picture books - with picture books, you can use words and pictures as a double act, even tell two different versions of a story at the same time.
- I used to have two brown-coloured cats, who were brother and sister, called Bonzo and Bonzetta.
- The first book I ever bought for myself was 'One Fish Two Fish' by Dr. Seuss. My favourite page shows two children carrying an enormous glass jar up some stairs in the dark. In the jar is a tusked beflippered creature floating in brine.
- I always kind of think I don't have a style, just whatever seems to be appropriate for the story.
- The great thing about making picture books is that you can make absolutely anything you want happen. It's a bit like making a film, but you don't need lots of money for actors and costumes - you just need pens, paper, and your imagination.
- I'd love to collaborate with a writer, but I'm such a control freak, it might be difficult.
- Anything new is a sort of adventure - as a child, I think I was quite bad at tackling new experiences, like unusual foods, and I hated new clothes or having my hair cut.
- Biscuits are sweet things in Britain, and apparently in America a biscuit is something like a scone, something savory that you'd have with soup.
- I think what I tend to do is look at all the very ordinary things that are around the house and imagine bringing them to life.
- I love food, and I love drawing it, particularly.
