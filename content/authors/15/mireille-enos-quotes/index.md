quotes = ['''When actors are the real deal, all that star whatever goes right out the window and you're there to tell a story.''' ,'''I don't know how people chew gum all day long.''' ,'''When I was doing theater for all those years in New York, I did a lot of classical theater, wearing big corsets and big dresses and doing dialects. It's interesting that once I moved to TV, I'm playing these scrappy, contemporary toughies.''' ,'''A lot of cop shows, because they have the restraints of having a new case every episode, the victims often become these kind of nameless, faceless plot points, and as an audience we don't feel anything for those people.''' ,'''AMC has a track record for finding actors who have been working actors but not names yet and casting them.''' ,'''My dad is this very sensible guy who never let me feel that anything was beyond my station.''' ,'''I grew up in Houston, in a pretty urbane setting.''' ,'''I can't worry about whether roles will be there for me when I'm older.''' ,'''The truth is I quite like to dress in jeans and a woolly jumper.''' ,'''I'm a black belt in tae kwon do.''' ,'''I'm really lucky to be married to a perfect person.''' ,'''I know as an actor there is a certain liberation auditioning for a role that has no beauty requirements.''' ,'''It's kind of part of human nature to want to know the truth or want to be in on the secret. For stories that focus in on that - like whodunits - it's easy to get drawn into.''' ,'''People say to me, 'Oh, being a mother must make you a better actor,' and I think, 'Well, I never sleep, I have very little time to think about anything except when I'm actually there.' I wonder whether that makes me a better actor. I think it must on some level.''' ,'''I'm really grateful for how my career has unfolded.''' ,'''When I was little, I used to work with my dad on the engine of his car. Mostly this was a matter of me handing him wrenches.''' ,'''My mother is French, my father is Texan.''' ,'''I can't worry about whether roles will be there for me when I'm older. They're there now, and I'm just not going to panic.''' ,'''I haven't been offered a lot of comedy. In theater, I've done quite a bit of comedy or dramas that included a lot of funny stuff. But in my TV work, those aren't the roles that I've been offered.''' ,'''Every role that you play comes with its own set of challenges.''' ,'''I'm positive and I smile a lot, and I'm kind of a banana, but serious work just seems to find me, so I'm not going to argue with it.''' ,'''Crime shows are really popular, in general, but usually, at the end of every episode, you have to let go of the people that you've invested in and then, the next week, get somebody else.''' ,'''I personally love a cliffhanger - I think it just extends the pleasure of viewing.''' ,'''I like laughter around me.''' ,]
