I will always carry those 13 years of my life in my heart.''' ,'''I want to win something with Lazio, and I am not talking about just winning games.''' ,'''As a player, I was always interested in tactics and how I can get better.''' ,'''I might have a different understanding of the term 'football star.' If I shoot a few balls after training, it's perfectly normal that I collect them afterwards.''' ,'''In a final, anything is possible.''' ,'''Politics should stay out of the stadium.''' ,'''Those who know me well know that the World Cup is my goal.''' ,'''This is a virile sport in which physical contact is allowed.''' ,'''I've always been a real striker.''' ,'''The national team is the best example that integration can work.''' ,'''I've had a great time with the national team and enjoyed some amazing moments.''' ,'''I was born in Poland, and then I was six years in France. I returned to Poland, and then, at the age of eight and a half, we came to Germany.''' ,'''Teams in the past have been slow starters yet gone on to win the World Cup.''' ,'''A World Cup is always something special and simply indescribable - and being able to hold something in your hands at the end of it all is just incredible.''' ,'''I'm not someone who clings on to records.''' ,'''Fishermen and coaches have one thing in common: both need to be very patient.''' ,'''I enjoyed my biggest successes with the national team.''' ,'''I've always known what I was capable of, which is why I didn't lose my self-belief.''' ,'''It is important for us to push into the box - not play around it like some sort of handball team.''' ,'''Kaiserslautern is and has always been a matter very close to my heart.''' ,'''The team's success always came first for me.''' ,'''I am convinced that when the team plays well, the attackers will have chances to score - and that's why I will have the chance to score.''' ,'''The coach told me that he has a lot of respect for me, and I am a player who has the ability to do anything I like - to score with both feet, to head well and to pass. To hear such words from a man like Voller gives me a lot of confidence and motivation.''' ,'''To have the chance to work with a World Cup-winning coach is special, and not everybody gets that opportunity.''' ,'''Personally, I always think that players like Diego Forlan are fantastic.''' ,'''My professional career only began at 21, really.''' ,'''Scoring and fishing are comparable. In both cases, you must have patience and wait for the right moment to strike power with the utmost coolness.''' ,'''An internship with Pep Guardiola would be a huge present.''' ,'''I spent five years in Italy, and the Italians have a slightly different lifestyle. Everything is a bit slower and more easygoing. You can feel that when you live there; you become a little more relaxed about typically 'German' things like accuracy and punctuality.''' ,'''I could very well see myself ending my professional career at Kaiserslautern.''' ,'''I always accept the decisions of the coach.''' ,'''Of course you want to coach in the Bundesliga when you move into coaching.''' ,'''I don't personally think of myself as an icon, but it's definitely an incredible thing. Scoring 16 goals at the World Cup is something you only usually dream about.''' ,]
