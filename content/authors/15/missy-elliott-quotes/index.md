- I feel like, O.K., if I can make it as a singer, then let me try rapping. If I can make it as a rapper, then let me try writing. All right? If I make it as a rap singer and writer, then why not try to produce? I don't feel limited in any way.
- It's just that back then we didn't know that was considered being a coproducer. I would sit on the side and say what I wanted musically, but at the time we thought if you aren't the one playing it, you don't get the credit. Now you'll start seeing my name listed as producer.

'Cause sometimes you're nice, and people don't jump on what they're supposed to do, but if you go in there screaming at everybody - 'Look, why aren't my posters up?' or 'Why wasn't my single out on this day?' - then they jump right on it.

- I don't want to be oh-so-brag-about-it, but 'The Rain' is hot.

It's harder for us to come out and be bosses and lead the pack.

- I was always feisty, always that kid that would be on the porch with a hairbrush singing or rapping.

- I talked about my father being abusive to my mother - people have never heard me talk about anything like that. That brings people a little bit more personal with Missy.
- Don Cornelius was a genius. He created a show where he was breaking artists' songs. If you were on his show, he made the consumer want to go out and purchase your music. He will be greatly missed. If they ever try to recreate what he did, it has to been done right, authentic and real with soul! That's what Don displayed.

- When I first started in the business, I spent so much! Staying in a Trump Hotel for two years, spending eight Gs a month just living.

- If I wanted to do 'The Missing Files of Missy Elliott,' I have probably six albums just sitting there.
