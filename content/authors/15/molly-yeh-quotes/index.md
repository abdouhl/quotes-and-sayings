quotes = ['''I hate buying stylish clothes because I get dressed up so rarely that they inevitably go out of style before I can wear them again. So I rent them.''' ,'''I've put my whole heart into cooking dishes that I am passionate about on 'Girl Meets Farm', and this has been met with such great support from the whole team and the Food Network and now our viewers.''' ,'''I don't want to take up space with another avocado toast.''' ,'''Writing a blog that is free to read on the internet is one thing, but taking up physical space in the world with a product that costs money ups the ante, so the quality has to be at a high enough level for that.''' ,'''There were a lot of publishers that I loved, so the book went to auction. An auction is where you sit nervously by your phone and eat potato chips for two days waiting for your agent to text you numbers of the highest bid for each round. I ultimately went with Dervla Kelly at Rodale Books.''' ,'''In most places in the Midwest, the best food is found in people's homes, on their farms, at church potlucks.''' ,'''My greatest inspiration is my Chinese and Jewish heritage and my travels.''' ,'''If people feel inspired to try something new and different in the kitchen then I'll have accomplished what I wanted to accomplish.''' ,'''I'm not above jarred baby food, if it's good ingredients, for convenience sake.''' ,'''In the beginning, my blog was exclusively read by my mom.''' ,'''By the time a meal I'm preparing rolls around, I'm usually so full from tasting that I'm not hungry any more.''' ,'''I love finding ways to bridge the gap between my heritage and my new farming community. An ingredient such as za'atar might be foreign, but throwing it into something familiar - a hot dish or an eggbake - makes it more approachable.''' ,'''On any given day, I want to know which restaurant near me is serving knoephla or chicken dumpling soup.''' ,'''I got so excited, just talking about hummus to the Food Network. I feel like you don't see a lot of hummus and challah and shakshuka on the Food Network and that was really the meat of the process.''' ,'''I suddenly had all of this time on my hands, so I just threw myself into the blog and then worked on photos, recipe development and networking with other bloggers, growing a following and growing it into something that could be a business.''' ,'''Growing up in the suburbs of Chicago and living in New York, it didn't even strike me as a possibility that a place could really exist without tons of Jews.''' ,'''It's never been my goal to create something that is found on the internet elsewhere. I only want to create things that are new.''' ,'''I like that I still feel like I can be myself and cook the food I'm really passionate about and want to be cooking.''' ,'''Don't plant too deeply. Pay attention to the directions on the seed packets as far as how deep and how close together to plant the seeds.''' ,'''I keep everything in Notepad: shopping lists, to-do lists, recipe tasting notes, my blog content calendar, recipe inspiration, blog-post drafts.''' ,'''Having an agent who had been through the process a million times and who could walk me through the process freed up a lot of mental space for me to just focus on the creative. I also worked with recipe testers, photographers, and assistants who were invaluable in creating a book that I'm truly proud of.''' ,'''My go-to ingredients that are also pantry-friendly start with freeze-dried berries. They're so potent with both flavor and color and can grind up into a fine powder and give you a smooth frosting or cake.''' ,'''I always enjoyed baking, but as far as eating, I always picked cheese fries over sweets.''' ,'''I live about five hours away from a Whole Foods and Trader Joe's, so I have to make extra sure that I get everything I need, otherwise I'm totally screwed.''' ,'''My journey from the blog to my books to the show has been fueled by a love of food and sharing it with others, and being able to pursue my passions as a career is a dream come true.''' ,'''I had been blogging for a few years when Jonah Straus, my now-literary agent, reached out to see if I'd consider writing a cookbook. At the time, I didn't feel ready; I was still getting adjusted to life in the upper Midwest, and I was still finding my recipe voice.''' ,'''The culture of home cooking is so strong.''' ,'''When the chickpeas are still warm from boiling, you get warm hummus, which feels more like a meal. And it's not that hard. Just plan ahead, soak them all night, and dump them in the food processor.''' ,'''The first five years I lived in New York I was going out every night, to restaurants and album releases and parties.''' ,'''On an ideal Saturday night, I'll go to the New York City Ballet, where my friends play percussion.''' ,'''I am that dork who packs a bike helmet in her suitcase.''' ,'''It's so fun to get creative with various colors in the kitchen. The challenge is finding how to get enough color without letting the flavor overpower - unless that's what you want!''' ,'''There's never been a moment where I've tried to be somebody that I'm not.''' ,'''Think realistically with what you're going to eat - don't plant 200 radishes!''' ,'''Question: How do you make a plate of hummus filling enough for a bunch of big burly farmers? Answer: Put meat all over it.''' ,'''I treat every reader as if they were a close friend.''' ,]
