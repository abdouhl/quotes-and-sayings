- Race, to me, is a very blurry thing.
- Sometimes, growing up, I tried to be very Latina; I would change my voice... experiment with my hair a lot, trying to figure out who I was in a primarily white school.
- I was always involved in the arts from a young age. I started studying classical piano at age four as a student of the Associated Board of the Royal School of Music.
- I am Dominican American. My father was born and raised in the U.S. and his heritage is German and Eastern European, and my mother hails from Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.
- Don't be afraid to fail. For the love of God, don't be afraid to fail, because you're going to fail. So try to fail as hard as you can is what I would say, because you're always going to get up and you're going to learn something from it.
- Doing well in school was a cool thing to do when I was in high school, so I had a blast.
- Actors are no strangers to self-doubt, fear, and rejection.
- I have a lot of things I want to do. I have a lot of fire. I want to do film. I want to do action movies. I want to do period pieces.
- There is nothing more noble than putting yourself in the line of fire to save a life.
- One thing my parents always taught me was to maximize my options.
- Little white lies are part of everyday life. If you're in court being charged with a felony, you're probably going to be tempted to lie. Or if your girlfriend asks you if the sweater she is wearing makes her look fat; you're going to lie because you love that person. There are different reasons and justifications to lie; it's human nature.
- Lying is not only a defense mechanism; it's also a coping mechanism and a survival technique.
- I read that a lot of people think I'm gay. I don't care. My boyfriend and I are not really phased by what people say.
- I know it sounds silly, but it takes some time getting used to all the cameras in your face. I think it's like playing jazz. After I learn the rules, I can have fun and play a little bit.
- Performing is my passion. Being onstage is at once exhilarating, beguiling, and fulfilling. But it's hard.
- Lie to Me' is one of the smartest shows on TV. We have something different, unique and new to say to the audience that they're not going to get from any other show.
- If I'm not working, I'm either sleeping or preparing for the next day of work.
- The love, support, and respect the members of the theater community have for one another is unparalleled. Say what you want about us wacky drama-types, but one thing that makes our business special is our loyalty, our fierce commitment to one another, and our mutual respect.
- Unfortunately, as much as I am gullible, I also hate lying. I tend to tell the truth a lot... lying just isn't worth it. But I think I'm guilty of telling people that I'm 5 minutes away when really I'm about 45 or an hour away.
- I love 'Top Chef.'
- Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender teens are bullied and ostracized in epidemic proportions. It's disgusting, and it must change.
- If you tell me that the sky is red, I will look up.
- Obviously I would love to work with all these great directors like the Coen Brothers, Tarantino. Robert Rodriguez is a dream director of mine.
