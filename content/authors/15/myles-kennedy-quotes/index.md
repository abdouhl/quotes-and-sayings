- 'Year Of The Tiger' definitely has much more of a blues-based vibe.
- Not playing guitar on 'World On Fire' gave me additional time to fine-tune lyrics and melodies, which improved the songs in the end. I'm very happy with how it turned out.
- I wish they had more Tim Horton's here in the States.
- From the artist's standpoint, are you getting more from streaming than you used to, prior to the days of the Internet? No - and I don't know if those days are ever going to come back - but at least, technically speaking, it's the legal way to do it.
- I'm a really big fan of Andy McKee - I think he's an amazing acoustic guitar player, and he's taken the torch from where Michael Hedges left off.
- The journey to the completion of 'Year Of The Tiger' was very interesting and full of a lot of trial and error.
- It's a little nerve-wracking to stand up on stage all by yourself.
- I think what I've learned to do is not look inward as much.
- What I did with Slash and the Conspirators was a very different kind of music. Genre-wise, it is a step in a different direction.
- Because Slash is such a well-known performer all over the world, it definitely helped with the awareness of Alter Bridge. People come up to me and say that they saw me playing with Slash, and it turned them on to the other things I do.
- I think one of the things I regret was not having more faith in myself early on.
- I don't feel like I really hit puberty until I was almost 17. I'd go to dinner with my family, and I'm 15 or 16 years old, and the waiter was still giving me the children's menu.
- I'm in a lower register because I'm not trying to shout out over a wall of amps. Singing lower sounded very pleasing to my ear, and it made it easier for me to emote.
- 'Apocalyptic Love,' that is pretty from the hip in the sense that, one day, Slash and I were talking - I think it was Slash and I - about the end of the world and the Mayan calendar and all that crazy stuff.
- I don't even know what progressive is anymore, to be honest!
- When I was a kid and listening to Zeppelin and Guns N' Roses, if someone had told me that there would come a time, and I would play some of those songs with those people, I would never have believed it.
- I think I've gradually learned to become more of a frontman than I was initially. I mean, when I first started, especially playing with Alter Bridge, you know, I really considered myself more a guitar player who sang.
- I'm kind of a firm believer that songs can have a shelf life with an artist.
- People have been saying rock is dead for years, but the reality is that it just falls out of favor with pop culture from time to time.
- Everything I ever learned about rock, I learned from Led Zeppelin.
- There's a warmth, obviously, with vinyl that you just don't get with CDs.
- One of the key emotions a lot of people seem to be feeling is disillusionment, and what I try to do as a lyricist is touch on these emotions.
- Grunge was, to me, the last big movement. It had such an impact on pop culture. We haven't really seen anything like that since, and we may never again. Things have changed; the digital age has changed things.
- I really enjoy the moments with Alter Bridge where I can step out and play lead and have fun.
- I realized, year of the tiger was 1974, which was the year my father passed away when I was a kid... My family, at that point, were Christian Scientists. So basically, this woman Mary Baker Eddy started this in the 1800s, and the premise is that you don't go to doctors. You believe that God is gonna heal you.
- Though rock is not the force that it once was in America, it still has a loyal fan base that always seems to continue regardless of what popular culture deems as the 'cool thing.'
- A lot of times when I'm performing a song, it tends to take me back to where I was psychologically as the lyric was being written.
- I'm certainly no Bruce Springsteen in terms of being a storyteller, but I'm trying to get a better handle on it and not always go after it from an autobiographical standpoint.
- There's a song called 'Slip To The Void,' which is fairly long and has more of an epic approach. And I guess for lack of a better term some people might throw the progressive tag on it. I don't know if it necessarily falls into that - a few people have brought that up who have heard it.
- I'm basically a happy person. I'm content with my life and my wife and my family. But you do reach a point where you start to question the absolutes that are supposedly out there, and you realize that there simply are no absolutes.
- It's not like I'm writing full songs or full parts and setting it aside for Slash because, generally, I like him to make the first move and hear where he's coming from and what his concepts are, and then I build from there.
- I think I'm most proud of the fact that I was able to overcome the insecurities that were going to keep me from living my dream, which was just learning to turn off those little voices in your head that tell you you're not capable of doing something.
- That's what I love more than anything, just creating.
- The guitar saved me from a life of crime as a teenager.
- I love playing with Slash, and the chemistry I have with the rest of the guys in his band is fantastic.
- 'World On Fire' isn't necessarily a profound statement about where we are as a planet. It's about living life to the fullest... carpe diem.
- Vocally, I don't think analogue makes that much difference, but with guitars, it definitely makes some difference. With drums and bass, absolutely.
- Every step, every bit of success, it's gotta be earned.
- I'm not a mixer. That's not what I do. I'm a songwriter, a singer, and a guitar player. You might have some ideas here and there, but you let the mixer mix the song because, overall, you've gotta trust their instincts.
- My grandmothers on both sides chose not to go to doctors and passed away. We were entrenched in the Christian Science faith.
- I think that's my goal as time goes on, is to just try and pay it forward.
