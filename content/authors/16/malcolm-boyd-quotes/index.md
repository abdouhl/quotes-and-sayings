quotes = ['''Yet through history gays have always dominated religious life and churches.''' ,'''I have glaucoma, so use eye drops both morning and night.''' ,'''Jesus is an example.

What matters is the heart's intent.''' ,'''Our essential differences from the norm are both huge and deeply offensive to those among us who wish to be quietly integrated into society without particular reference to our nature.''' ,'''Speaking for myself, my very integrity as a human being needs to include my freedom to explore who I am both spiritually and sexually.

Being with God in a deliberate way.''' ,'''Real answers need to be found in dialogue and interaction and, yes, our shared human condition. This means being open to one another instead of simply fighting to maintain a prescribed position.''' ,]
