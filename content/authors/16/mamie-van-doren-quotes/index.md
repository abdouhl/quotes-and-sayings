- I have never been a Marilyn Monroe wannabe. I have always been happy in my own skin!
- I was always protective of Jayne. I never allowed people to talk about her behind her back because those same people would talk about me.

I've accepted it, and I'm flattered, but in some ways, it's been a hindrance to me because I haven't been able to be taken seriously as an actress.
