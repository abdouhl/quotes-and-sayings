As men become aware that few have had a fair chance, they are inclined to say that no women have had a fair chance.''' ,'''Male and female represent the two sides of the great radical dualism. But in fact they are perpetually passing into one another. Fluid hardens to solid, solid rushes to fluid. There is no wholly masculine man, no purely feminine woman.''' ,]
