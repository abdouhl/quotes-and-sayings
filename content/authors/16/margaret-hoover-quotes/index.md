quotes = ['''Republicans can take cold comfort in the fact that the surge in millennial support for Obama that Democrats had hoped for in 2012 didn't turn up.''' ,'''Portman embodies the formula for GOP modernization: a conservatism that unapologetically applies the principle of individual freedom consistently to both fiscal and social policy. The senator has breathed new life into a national party grasping for traction with young Americans.''' ,'''The triumph, real triumph of the feminist movement is that women get to choose.''' ,'''I'm always trying to see the forest for the trees. I try to look at broader brushstrokes and focus on what we can be happy about. That's my nature.''' ,'''Guys are not going to go see a chic flick when 'Indiana Jones' is playing.''' ,'''I think we can reform Social Security without raising taxes, which is better for economic growth.''' ,'''Perfect is not on the menu. Nobody is going to be your ideal candidate. You can't dream somebody up out of nothing that's going to be the perfect candidate, so you do have to pick between a series of bad choices.''' ,'''The art of negotiating is a learned skill. It is practiced and often honed in the marketplace as well as legislative bodies.''' ,'''In any civil society, there's a serious problem when confidence in the rule of law is shaken.''' ,'''Bill O'Reilly's firing is a welcome step by Fox News and its parent company, 21st Century Fox, by a new generation of leadership trying to modernize the country's conservative media flagship and change its culture. But it is just a step.''' ,'''Some conservative groups believe that a person cannot be both conservative and gay. They believe that traditional lives cannot be led by those who have not traditionally been accepted by society.''' ,'''Hoover also loved new media the way Millennials do now. He was the first person to ever appear on television. As commerce secretary, he standardized the radio industry so businesses could harness its commercial value. He didn't e-mail my great-grandmother a marriage proposal - but he did cable her one, all the way from Australia.''' ,'''Hoover's first emphasis was on the individual, the spark for all innovation and progress. This is a man who, while commerce secretary, standardized our modern economy, from brick sizes to bed sizes, so that housewives would not be frustrated when the sheets that arrived didn't fit.''' ,'''The decision to have an abortion is a deeply personal decision between a woman, her family, her doctor, her God; not her government, and not the public at large.''' ,'''As we all know there have been fabulous women chief executives: Margaret Thatcher, Golda Meir.''' ,'''I think the Tea Party has brought enormous strength to the Republican Party and I absolutely support its fiscal responsibility message, yes.''' ,'''Going into the 2012 election, I worried that without effectively connecting with the youth vote, the GOP risked losing the millennial generation for the rest of their lives.''' ,'''Young people understand that there is not a Social Security trust fund. Social Security is a pay-as-you-go system, where today's millennials are paying for today's seniors.''' ,'''Even for most of the GOP's old-school legislators, there is dawning understanding that opposition to freedom to marry is on the wrong side of history and damaging to the long-term, and increasingly the short-term, prospects of the GOP, especially among independent-minded younger voters.''' ,'''Millennials are concerned with national debt and the deficits.''' ,'''Ben Carson has what Iowa caucus-goers favor - the soft touch and outsider status, and no fear of going after Obamacare and the excesses of Washington.''' ,'''I was certainly in the stop Trump camp, but not for anyone.''' ,'''The key to winning millennials is to stick to pragmatic solutions issue by issue. The millennial generation is characterized partly by their desire to see the system work - and they get that this system isn't working. But they also want to be part of the solution.''' ,'''People want our elected officials to govern and for government to work.''' ,'''I'm not suggesting that we promote a homosexual lifestyle and we impose it on people, but I am suggesting that it is important to be reflective of our culture and to not kibosh people from the mainstream.''' ,'''I think there's an extraordinary overlap between - sort of philosophically, and even in terms of their supporters - between Ted Cruz and Donald Trump. And that is not a part of the Venn diagram that I relate to or identify with when it comes to being a Republican.''' ,'''Most people aren't Republicans four generations down from a president.''' ,'''Pragmatic and nonpartisan solutions will increase confidence in law enforcement and support good police while offering more transparency and accountability to citizens who have lost confidence in the justice system.''' ,'''You certainly grow up on the defensive when you're related to America's most pilloried 20th-century president.''' ,'''We've found that people crave a thoughtful exchange of ideas in a long-form interview, which is why the tradition that we have inherited from the original 'Firing Line' is relevant again. Our program has impacted the way the public understands our policymakers in Washington and beyond.''' ,'''I love Jay-Z.''' ,'''People represent their constituencies and have particular interests based on who they are and the experiences that have formed them. You don't have to be a child to be an advocate for children. You don't have to be a woman to be an advocate for women. You don't have to be Hispanic to be an advocate for Hispanics.''' ,'''I can't bring myself to vote for Donald Trump.''' ,'''I would never date a guy with short hair.''' ,'''Surely no nation in the history of the world had ever done so much to help civilians in other nations as America did under Hoover's guidance.''' ,'''The problem is the far left isn't very good at governing.''' ,'''Gays and lesbians are our friends, neighbors, doctors, colleagues, sisters and brothers.''' ,'''Conservatives believe that a self-governing society depends on individuals taking responsibility for their actions, and those of their family and community. They deride others, especially American liberals, who fall short of this standard, who blame anything other than themselves for personal transgressions or failures.''' ,'''Women's role in the household has changed since the women's movement. I don't know if women's role outside the household has changed. I mean, are more women mowing lawns and fixing shingles and doing electrical work and plumbing?''' ,'''The G.O.P. needs to fight for women votes because it believes our policies are better for women.''' ,'''While increasing acceptance of gays marks my generational experience - Ellen DeGeneres is welcomed into the living rooms of millions of Americans daily, an impossibility in even my childhood - many who are older than me fear that if gays and lesbians can marry, what's next?''' ,'''Conservative faith traditions argue rightly for strict religious protections in the law so that churches, synagogues and mosques aren't forced to perform ceremonies inconsistent with their religious teachings.''' ,'''The conservative argument for marriage includes a recognition of the traditional value of marriage as a stabilizing force in society.''' ,'''Politics follows the lines of physics. Every action creates an equal and opposite reaction.''' ,'''I have to object to this notion that children form their sexuality and their sexual identity from their parents. The truth is that scientists, biologists, we don't know how sexuality is formed in people. And to suggest that people are going to be gay if they're raised by gay parents is just scientifically unfounded.''' ,'''In 2010, the excesses of the social welfare state are well known and understood to all Americans except the liberal wing of the Democratic Party, which controls Congress.''' ,'''Everyone knows Washington is broken.''' ,'''I worked my way through college.''' ,'''What's helpful is develop a self-esteem, feel good about yourself, feel like you're a whole, complete person.''' ,'''One of the core pillars of the modern American conservative movement is its emphasis on personal responsibility.''' ,'''In some ways, Herbert Hoover can be considered a millennial in spirit: young at the turn of the century, aware of America's past but deeply committed to building its future. His greatest passion and highest calling was service to others, and he measured his life's successes not in dollars and votes but in results achieved.''' ,'''I'm by nature a glass half-full person.''' ,'''When an unpopular minority is denied the right to marry, it is indeed the role of the courts to protect the rights of that minority, especially when a majority would deny them.''' ,'''Conservatives and individualists support policies that favor more freedom for individuals.''' ,'''More and more Republicans are recognizing and respecting the essential dignity of individuals who are gay and deserve the full rights of citizenship, just like their straight brothers and sisters.''' ,'''Hoover was a globalist and a technologist, and he understood America's rising position in the world.

And we get to choose, and we get to negotiate and work that out with our prospective husbands or with our husbands.''' ,'''Look, a conservative feminist stands for increasing responsibility and increasing personal freedom.''' ,'''Socially conservative Republican presidential candidates would do best to unite around policies that will both strengthen marriage and protect religious liberties - rather than fruitlessly trying to tell fellow Americans who they can and can't marry.''' ,'''Too many of our conversations in the media hinge on conflict delivered in three-second sound bites.''' ,'''Some Republicans support gay rights, but prefer progress through legislative action or majority rule at the ballot box, rather than judicial action.''' ,'''In my mid-20s I worked at the White House Office of Management and Budget.''' ,'''There's something really specific about being a Hoover and the pejorative term that was multigenerationally tethered to economic hard times, misery and antipathy for the struggles of ordinary people.''' ,'''The rise of Ben Carson is a fascinating case study in grassroots cultivation that's resulted in strong support among evangelicals and women, reflected in the most robust small donor base in the 2016 race.''' ,'''Cable news tends to be talking points - you don't have that much time to substantively unpack an issue.''' ,'''From his lifetime of experience as a turnaround expert in private equity to his experience with the turnaround mission of the Olympics to his successful term as a blue state GOP governor, Romney can point to a record of bipartisan leadership and achievement that Obama can only talk about.''' ,'''Bully pulpit of the presidency is really tough to fight.''' ,'''The response to Season 1 of 'Firing Line' has been a thrill for everyone involved with the show.''' ,'''More Republicans should champion the implementation of body-worn cameras on police officers, requested by Michael Brown's family and supported by Republican law enforcement proponent Rudy Giuliani.''' ,'''In a time where the middle class is squeezed by stagnant incomes and rising health care costs, Ben Carson looks like he cares.''' ,'''I'm not a fan of Ted Cruz at all.''' ,'''I empathize with the vast majority of cops who keep the peace on our streets and enjoy majority support from their communities across the country.''' ,'''I run a gay-rights organization from the Republican side of the aisle.''' ,'''There's no problem with a woman being president of the United States if you take her gender as a sole issue. Gender shouldn't matter.''' ,'''Efforts to support gay rights by GOP state legislators in several states are real and indicative of an increasing realization that expanding equal opportunity and freedom to gay Americans shouldn't be a partisan issue.''' ,'''My Republican Party has no choice but to reach out to millennials.''' ,'''Americans mostly don't want lower taxes.''' ,'''There are plenty of broken homes that don't have parents.''' ,'''While the reigning stereotype is that Republicans are opposed to gay rights, growing Republican support in state-by-state fights belies this perception.''' ,'''The conservative movement was founded on core principles of liberty, individual freedom, limited government and building and promoting strong families.''' ,'''For conservatives, every policy solution starts with an individual picking oneself up, acknowledging his or her mistakes, as a first step to improving his or her circumstances.''' ,'''Republicans were historically the party ever-expanding freedom to disenfranchised minorities, from newly liberated slaves to giving women the right to vote.
