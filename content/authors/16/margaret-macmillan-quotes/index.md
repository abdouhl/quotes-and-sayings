quotes = ['''As history reminds us again and again, wars are not always made on the basis of rational calculations: often the contrary.''' ,'''In my view, Germany could and should have made reparations for its aggression in World War I - but was the risk of renewed war worth forcing it to do so?''' ,'''I first read the 'Raj Quartet' in the early 1970s, when Paul Scott's decision to set his novels in the dying days of the British Raj in India seemed an eccentric choice, almost as though he did not want readers. The British were tired of their imperial past.''' ,'''History does not produce definitive answers for all time. It is a process.''' ,'''If you read about millions of people doing this and millions of people doing that, history seems remote and inaccessible.''' ,'''War is a crucial, deeply ingrained part of human history. It has to be understood.''' ,'''As a child, I had loved history because it showed so many alternative worlds.''' ,'''Women are interested in relationships and how other societies manage those relationships. They may have been constrained in what roles were open to them, but they could question and observe, and they could write it down.''' ,'''Nigel Farage, the leader of the U.K. Independence Party, is a true populist; Senator Bernie Sanders, the former U.S. presidential candidate who campaigned for Hillary Clinton after losing his battle for the Democratic Party's nomination, is not.''' ,'''The act of apology is something that most societies take very seriously indeed. It is an admission of wrong done to the victims and an acceptance of blame.''' ,'''By the start of August 1914, it was dawning on the British that a major war was about to break out on mainland Europe. Public opinion and, crucially, the cabinet was deeply divided on whether to intervene or stay out.''' ,'''Climate change respects no borders.''' ,'''The Italian futurists, the German expressionists, and the British vorticists were fascinated by speed and the ways the modern world was shattering conventions. The old ways of painting, writing, sculpting, and composing no longer seemed adequate to capture the world.''' ,'''History matters.''' ,'''We must do our best to raise the public awareness of the past in all its richness and complexity.''' ,'''I wish we could see understanding the First World War as a European issue, or even a global one, and not a nationalistic one.''' ,'''An apology offered and, equally important, received is a step towards reconciliation and, sometimes, recompense. Without that process, hurts can rankle and fester and erupt into their own hatreds and wrongdoings.''' ,'''Women throughout history have had to defy rigid conventions about what is and is not expected of them.''' ,'''If you start thinking war is inevitable, then in your own times, you don't resist it as strongly as you should.''' ,'''The Canadian government has had a field day apologising for past policies towards a series of ethnic groups: Italian, Ukrainian, Sikh, Chinese, Japanese and Jews.''' ,'''I'm interested in the balance between big currents in history - the economies, the ideologies, social structures, and so on - and the decisions that people have to make. At the heart of all these great decisions to go to war, there are human beings who have to say, 'Yes, let's do it,' or 'No, we won't do it.'''' ,'''Use it, enjoy it, but always handle history with care.''' ,'''I think what we should do as historians is understand. And we can have our own views about how things turned out, but I think, in making judgements, we're getting into tricky territory.''' ,'''The cubism of Braque or Picasso, the dissonant compositions of Schoenberg or Stravinsky, the free-flowing and often erotic choreography of Isadora Duncan and Nijinsky - these were acts of rebellion against the certainties and traditions of the old world.''' ,'''I do tend to look at individuals and whether they do or do not matter in history.''' ,'''Individual lives remind us that there is something called a common humanity and that, over the centuries, there have been people who have lived and breathed and sometimes worried about very different things and sometimes worried about the same things we do.''' ,'''Some might argue humans are hard-wired to fight. I don't agree: we are conscious beings who have the capacity to make decisions.''' ,'''How curious that such an outsize man, in physique as well as personality, should be remembered today mainly for giving his name to a small fish. For the 19th century, Bismarck was no herring but a leviathan. Between 1862 and 1890, he created Germany, seeing off first the Austrian empire and then France.''' ,'''I still remember with gratitude a series for children on everyday life where we learned about the games children in other times had played and the food they ate.''' ,'''A lot of my father's family in Canada volunteered in the First World War because they saw it as a war that was defending the mother country.''' ,'''American diplomats worked closely with the League of Nations. The United States used its considerable influence to settle some of the outstanding issues left over from World War I, and Washington took the lead in negotiating naval limitations in the Pacific.''' ,'''We can prevent fighting by limiting weapons or finding nonviolent ways to end disputes.''' ,'''History is about great forces, yes, but also about contingency.''' ,'''Managing the relationship with a giant neighbour has been central to our foreign policy for more than a century. Trade and investment, as well as people, have flowed back and forth across the border, and the U.S. is, by far, our biggest trading partner.''' ,'''Exercising power can do strange things to people. You can become convinced that you're irreplaceable. You can become convinced that you're always right. And I think the danger is the longer you stay in power, the more likely that is to happen.''' ,'''I'm not sure I'm going to say that women and men are exactly the same. I think we may have different ways of approaching things, different sensitivities, and women are often better than men at picking up emotional cues.''' ,'''Hubris is interesting, because you get people who are often very clever, very powerful, have achieved great things, and then something goes wrong - they just don't know when to stop.''' ,'''The word 'populism' was everywhere in 2016. Political leaders claiming to speak for the people have achieved significant victories in Europe, Asia, and, with the election of Donald Trump, the United States.''' ,'''Nominally left- and right-wing populists differ primarily in their choice of which 'others' to exclude and attack, with the former singling out big corporations and oligarchs, and the latter targeting ethnic or religious minorities.''' ,'''No one is always right.''' ,'''Living through times of rapid change can be exhilarating, but it also can be very difficult.''' ,'''The 1898 annexation of the Hawaiian Islands merely formally recognized what had long been American domination.''' ,'''Maintaining peace can be as strenuous as winning a war.''' ,'''Canadians see the Americans as cousins. We love the same sports: Canadians are crazy about baseball and basketball, and our beloved game of hockey is played all over the U.S.''' ,'''As a Canadian, I've always approached international history as an outsider, neither attacking nor defending key decisions - those were made by actors who are also major figures within national historical traditions for American and British scholars.''' ,'''I like to think I'm a recovering historian.''' ,'''Our interest in history always reflects our own times.''' ,'''I've always been interested in war, but especially its effects on society, which means bringing in the voices of women, which aren't heard as much in the grand narratives.''' ,'''I've always loved reading diaries and memoirs and just getting a sense of different personalities and what made them tick as individuals.''' ,'''It is true that large parts of the world have not had to endure state-to-state wars for decades. The majority of the world's nations have also been spared the scourge of civil wars, although many have known violence from revolutionary insurrection.''' ,'''It's not going to be easy to create a world where both sides prefer peace, but we have to try.''' ,'''Women are so much a part of war, even if they tend to see another side of it. To say they don't understand war is ridiculous.''' ,'''In the 19th century, we didn't much like the loud annexationist voices south of the border or American support for Sinn Fein adventurers who thought, by seizing the Canadian colonies, they could force Britain out of Ireland.''' ,'''When I first read Barbara Tuchman's 'The Guns of August' in the autumn of 1963, it was as though history went from black and white to Technicolor.''' ,'''The Great War was nobody's fault - or everybody's.''' ,'''Nuclear proliferation has never entirely been brought under control, and the arsenals of nuclear powers contain bombs far more powerful than those dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.''' ,'''I did projects on Champlain coming up the St. Lawrence River and on Henry Hudson cast adrift in the bay that now bears his name. And I read dozens of historical novels: Rosemary Sutcliff on Roman Britain and G. A. Henty on British heroes, though my all-time favourite was Ronald Welch's 'Knight Crusader.'''' ,'''Many in the English-speaking world came to agree with the Germans that the Treaty of Versailles, and the reparations in particular, were unjust, and that Lloyd George had capitulated to the vengeful French.''' ,'''History can be helpful in making sense of the world we live in. It can also be fascinating, even fun.''' ,'''Modernism was born in part out of the need to find fresh ways of expression, to describe a new world that was unlike anything that had gone before.''' ,'''If a bully wants to beat you up, you have the choice of running away or standing your ground. In our society, we have police forces who try to control bullies, sometimes by force.''' ,'''History belongs to everyone. I don't think you have to give up scholarly standards. But I also don't think you want to write something that is impenetrable. You try as hard as you can to be readable.''' ,'''For many human beings, an interest in the past starts with themselves. That is, in part, a result of biology. Like other creatures, humans have a beginning and an ending, and in between lies their story.''' ,'''The range of weapons at the disposal of military powers is terrifying in its capacity to damage the world and its inhabitants, perhaps even to bring humanity's long story to its end.''' ,'''A large part of Canada heads for Florida, California, and Hawaii in the winter to get away from the snow.''' ,'''When I sat down to make a list of characters in history who exhibited curiosity, most were women. I thought it was sheer accident, and then I began to wonder.''' ,'''How can even the best novelist or playwright invent someone like Augustus Caesar or Catherine the Great, Galileo or Florence Nightingale? How can screenwriters create better action stories or human dramas than exist, thousand upon thousand, throughout the many centuries of recorded history?''' ,'''The trouble with the First World War, for example, is that people think war was inevitable, but I don't agree. If you look at the Cold War, you could argue that a war was bound to happen between the Soviet Union and its allies and the United States and its allies, but it didn't.''' ,'''I'm always wary of the lessons of the past. There's a lot of past out there, and you can draw whatever lessons you want.''' ,'''I tend to think history is more a branch of literature than science.''' ,'''There was that argument that if we had more women in positions of authority, the world would be a nicer place. And then we got Golda Meir, Margaret Thatcher, Sirimavo Bandaranaike, Indira Gandhi. When women become acclimatised to war, they can become every bit as ruthless as men.''' ,'''Theodore Roosevelt's policy to build a two-ocean navy confirmed that the old-style isolationism of the founders had not survived the modern, increasingly globalized world.''' ,'''Poor little Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan, or whatever her name is. It must be incredible at that age to be surrounded by people telling you you're wonderful.''' ,'''You shouldn't expect people in the past to do things they couldn't have done.''' ,'''It took a world war, between 1914 and 1918, to draw the United States into a deeper and more sustained relationship with the wider world.''' ,'''We mistake being able to get lots of information from everywhere very quickly with actually getting knowledge.''' ,'''The only person, if you're a religious person, who's always right is God. And if you make the mistake of thinking that you, like God, are always right, and that you, like God, always know everything, then it seems to me you're riding for a fall.''' ,'''If we do not, as historians, write the history of great events as well as the small stories that make up the past, others will, and they will not necessarily do it well.''' ,'''The passion for the past is clearly about more than market forces or government policies. History responds to a variety of needs, from greater understanding of ourselves and our world to answers about what to do.''' ,'''George W. Bush, judging by his repeated invocations, thinks that time will eventually prove that he was right. He is not alone in putting his faith in the future.''' ,'''Are artists the canaries in the mine, warning of the coming explosion before anyone else? It's hard to look at the world before 1914 and not wonder if they somehow felt a catastrophe was bearing down on them and their societies.''' ,'''Political orientation is unimportant in populism because it does not deal in evidence or detailed proposals for change but in the manipulation of feelings by charismatic leaders.''' ,'''If we don't take responsibility for each other, it seems to me the future is going to be even bleaker.''' ,]
