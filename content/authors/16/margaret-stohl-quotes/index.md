- I was an obsessive fantasy reader from the time I could read at all.
- I understand that fictional men aren't real. Not 'really real'. I know this the same way I wonder if my readers are disappointed when they meet me.
- We wanted to celebrate the 'Dangerous Deception' release by letting everyone experience the thrill of sharing a book with a reader who wouldn't otherwise have one.
- When you're writing about superpowers, you're writing about power. When you're writing about immortals, you're writing about mortality.
- At heart, I would have to say I'm a pantser. I fully embrace the chaos of letting the unintended happen, on life and on the page.
- You better have your story down before you take it to a teenager.
- Everyone reads Harper Lee personally. For me, 'Mockingbird' was about admitting my own hyphenated identity - about loving and hating my world, about both belonging and not belonging to the community I came from.
- I first read Harper Lee's 'To Kill a Mockingbird' as a teen in school, like you did. I read the book alone, eating lunch at my locker, neatly scored oranges my mother divided into five lines with a circle at the top, so my fingers could dig more easily into the orange skin. To this day, the smell of oranges reminds me of 'Mockingbird.'
- The Lowcountry traditionally is a logical place where the big ships stopped and brought new things in from the ocean, and the islands have a mystical tradition. It is such a visual place, too, with these iconic villages with the Spanish moss and the village and historical homes and the coast.
- Alden Ehrenreich is a drama nerd, and Alice Englert is indie girl. They're so cool in the way that our characters are cool.
- I fictionship. I love fictional men.
- I was very shy - I didn't speak to anyone outside of my family until the fourth grade.
- The privilege, and the challenges, of taking on Black Widow have never been lost on me. I worked on the first 'Spiderman' game as well as 'Fantastic Four,' and I had always wanted to be able to tell more of a character-driven comic book story than was possible to fit into a game narrative.
- I worked as a writer, lead designer, and creative director in the game industry.
- You need books to read and readers for books.
- I think, to give our bookshelf a little credit, our area of the library and the bookstore has attracted stronger writers as it's started to thrive.
- Sam and Dean Winchester sitting on the top of the Impala sharing their feelings over a beer is a reward worth driving any 'Supernatural' demon away - but in real life, they'd have crippling co-dependency issues.
- I'm up at dawn. I practically fall asleep at dinner.
- Harper Lee was my David Bowie, and I feel her loss in my bones.
- There's a lot of loneliness in a book tour. A lot of grilled cheese sandwiches alone in your hotel at night.
- Anyone who says that writing for children or teens is easier than writing for adults has never tried it, because they are so much more critical than adults. You cannot get anything past them.
- My solo novel 'Icons' was optioned by Alcon Entertainment, the folks who made the 'Beautiful Creatures' movie, and that's gotten as far as a script, but no news yet.
- If you look at 'Doctor Who,' it's a Time Lord in a blue box who travels around the universe. It's a silly concept, but it's one of the most brilliant, emotional experiences because it's sort of about what is humanity.
- People ask why do I write strong women characters, and basically, all the girls I know are strong; the girls I've had are strong. The women in my life are strong.
- It's like how science fiction in the '50s was a way of talking about war without actually having to risk any political capital. The obvious metaphor is power and powerlessness, but I also think it's a way of experimenting with dangerous feelings in a safe arena and trying things out.
- Writing is the easy part. The 'getting it right' part is harder.
- It's a fallacy that people think that today's teenagers are shallow or somehow less intelligent than in the past.
- I'm always excited to see my good buddy Richelle Mead. She cracks me up. I never get to see Veronica Roth enough, either.
- It doesn't matter if it's aliens or emotional weapons or whatever - it's still a real story about big feelings that have to come out.
- We kept my middle schooler home from school for three days before we turned in our final draft because she was so mean and so brutal at editing out all the cheesy bits. She would roll her eyes and make fun of us, and it was what we needed.
- I was the person who stayed awake reading by the nightlight until the scary shadows made me crazy.
- Getting books out into the world helps us all.
- Everything I write is about big feelings. What I care about is trying to be brave enough to feel how you feel and to be emotionally true.
- Sometimes people who sell books are seen as corporate salesmen, and people who sell reading are seen as literacy advocates, but you can't really separate the two.
- I grew up sitting in my closet waiting to go Narnia.
- Han Solo would never wear the earring Harrison Ford wears.
- I always say, 'I'm cracked. My characters are cracked. And you, reader, you're cracked, too.'
- I was raised in a community of Christian orthodoxy that had traveled with my parents to Los Angeles when they moved there for my father's job.
- I worked in videogames for 16 years before writing my first book in 2009.
- I like to make an outline or cards and then utterly ignore them.
- We love what we love, and shared fandoms bring people of all ages and backgrounds into one great tribe.
