quotes = ['''I remember my parents quarrelling. They would talk as if they were against each other's ideas about Trotsky, but it was just a couple arguing.''' ,'''I wouldn't define myself as the girl from 'Pulp Fiction.'''' ,'''The left-wing thinkers and intellectuals have been more misogynist with me than the army.

They ask who is the man behind me.''' ,'''I like to dream about Portugal, and it's less easy when you are there.''' ,'''People of my generation in Portugal fell into the magic potion of political ideas.
