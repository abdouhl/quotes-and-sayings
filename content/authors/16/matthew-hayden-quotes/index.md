We've got a long way to go until the next World Cup and for us it's one ruthless game after another where we can play well.''' ,'''Both sides have been playing tremendous cricket over a couple of years and they're both very good units.''' ,'''This game is something Australians really look forward to.''' ,'''It's a fun day, a day which kicks off the start of our tour, it's got great tradition - Australian cricketers just love tradition - and it's been a really pleasant day.''' ,'''One of the things that I miss the most about cricket and batting in particular is that meditation of cricket, that involvement of myself - mind, body and spirit - to delivering that one specific process, which is to execute a cricket shot. It is a beautiful feeling; it is very hard to replicate.''' ,'''When I came to the high-performance arena, I was kind of a one-off in a lot of ways. I was as much an iron man as much as I was a cricketer.

We used to train together every day, and we'd train for so long that at the end of a session, we would physically almost collapse.''' ,'''As a civilian not playing sport, to get that sense of real belonging and feeling how you are progressing through the day is what I loved and miss.''' ,]
