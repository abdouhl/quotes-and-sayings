quotes = ['''My theory is that there's a knee-jerk reaction against technology in movie making.''' ,'''I like the idea of making big budget films with a heart. I like graphic novels more than comic books.''' ,'''If you do something that's different and quirky and original, it takes time for people to figure it out.''' ,'''High-concept one-liners were huge when I got my start in the film industry.''' ,'''I'll never be a good writer, and no chance of being a good actor.''' ,'''And writing I think is a gift that you have, the same as acting, in a way.''' ,'''What I learned very quickly is that if you get it right in the first two or three takes, it's not going to get that much better.''' ,'''I'm a big believer that it doesn't matter what you call your company, nobody ever notices.''' ,'''I'm not a member of a minority but I can empathize with what's going on.''' ,'''Crime, money, power, drugs - are all linked.''' ,'''I was so nervous about 'Kingsman,' I can't tell you, because when you do things different and fresh and fun and crazy, you don't know how people are going to react.''' ,'''Cliches are what make you understand something.''' ,'''I'm a Star Wars fanatic.''' ,'''I think there's a time in your life where you don't feel like you fit in.

I'm really bad in front of a camera. It wouldn't work.''' ,'''I will never sign anything which makes me have to do more than one film.''' ,'''I tried to buy the script of 'Hancock.' I loved it. The script was far darker and edgier than the movie.''' ,'''If it's scary, it's supposed to be scary. If it's funny, it's supposed to be funny. That's all I try to do.''' ,'''I don't believe in development. I believe in pre-pre-production, so when I sit down with an idea for a movie, I'm thinking I'm going to make this film. I don't think about anything else.''' ,'''I used to be very much Jekyll-and-Hyde, where the Jekyll in me would say, 'Keep to the budget, be responsible,' and Hyde would be like ,'Ah, we can do an extra shot or an extra day.'''' ,'''For me, I'm not Spielberg. I can't edit while filming another film.''' ,'''You either ignore the comic book and make a great movie or you stay very close to the comic book.''' ,'''I'm more of a comic-book movie fan than a comic book fan.''' ,'''It's a juggernaut, yeah... but I'm not phased by making movies.''' ,'''I think music is what takes the experience off the screen into your soul, into your head.''' ,'''I've always loved 'Bond.' There were two franchises that I would always have dropped everything to do as a director. 'Bond' was one; 'Star Wars' was other.''' ,'''I think you should make a movie that has an audience.''' ,'''People just want to watch movies that are entertaining, it doesn't matter what genre it is.''' ,'''Some people are directors and I think they should stay behind the camera.''' ,'''You can't please everyone...

'The Avengers,' 'Harry Palmer,' 'The Prisoner,' 'The Man from UNCLE,' 'In Like Flint.' Of course, there's a huge shadow of Bond - Bond is the monolith of spy movies - but it's not just about Bond; there were a lot of other things that influenced me.''' ,]
