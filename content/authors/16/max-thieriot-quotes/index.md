- I've done a little bit of everything now, but I would like to do a Western because I've never done that.
- As much as I appreciate acting and enjoy it, and like it, it wasn't something where I grew up wanting to be a movie star.
- At first, I didn't like coming down to Los Angeles at all. It's like, everything's black and white compared to where I live out in the middle of nowhere. There's, like, 400 people in my town!
- I've never done an actual Western, and I would love to do that. I've done drama and dark comedy stuff. I've never really done a romantic comedy either. I would do that.
- There are a lot of actors that are insanely talented, so I don't say who my favorite is anymore.
- I moved to L.A. right after I finished high school, for three years, because everybody was telling me it was important to get down there, and then I kind of just decided for myself that I didn't need to be there to be doing this. I wanted out of some of the chaos that comes with living here and being an actor.
- I don't like going to dinner by myself; I'll call for delivery before I do that. It's awkward if you're at a table all alone. I'm sure nobody even notices, but there's something about it.
- It's always interesting researching characters and as I get older and the more that I work in this business, I do more and more of it because I realize how important it is.
