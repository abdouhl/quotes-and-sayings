- Before I got into acting, I was always interested in psychology, which I think is very common with a lot of actors because in a weird way, psychology and acting kind of seem interwoven.
- You need to be feel beautiful on your own before a guy can make you feel beautiful, because it wont be a healthy relationship.
- I trained in Toronto with a private acting teacher, who was wonderful, for years growing up.
- I think the most important thing is you have to learn to love auditioning, which I have definitely learned to love. It's going to be a huge part of your career, even if you're right at the top. You're still going to have to audition sometimes, and if you don't learn to love that, that's such a big part of what you're job's going to be.
- My first break wasn't professional - I was in 'The Sound of Music' when I was five. I played Gretel, the youngest one, because that was what kind of took off for me in terms of loving acting.
- I never really wore makeup in high school; I wasn't really into it yet, which is probably good.
- I'm such a believer in 'if you're beautiful on the inside it really shows on the outside.' I know a lot of people who are physically very beautiful, but their inside doesn't represent that. So to me, it just doesn't come across as having a sparkle to them or an energy that just radiates.
- It's kind of interesting when you sign on to a show because you're basically signing on to play a character because you only really see the first episode of the show.
- I'm becoming more and more confident and am falling more and more in love with the whole world of comedy, and I think that's something that I really want to explore a lot more.
