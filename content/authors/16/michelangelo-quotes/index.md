By this you are truly known.''' ,'''If we have been pleased with life, we should not be displeased with death, since it comes from the hand of the same master.''' ,'''I live in sin, to kill myself I live; no longer my life my own, but sin's; my good is given to me by heaven, my evil by myself, by my free will, of which I am deprived.''' ,'''Trifles make perfection, and perfection is no trifle.''' ,'''A man paints with his brains and not with his hands.''' ,'''There is no greater harm than that of time wasted.''' ,'''If in my youth I had realized that the sustaining splendour of beauty of with which I was in love would one day flood back into my heart, there to ignite a flame that would torture me without end, how gladly would I have put out the light in my eyes.''' ,'''It is necessary to keep one's compass in one's eyes and not in the hand, for the hands execute, but the eye judges.''' ,'''From such a gentle thing, from such a fountain of all delight, my every pain is born.''' ,'''Even if you are divine, you don't disdain male consorts.''' ,'''Death and love are the two wings that bear the good man to heaven.''' ,'''My soul can find no staircase to Heaven unless it be through Earth's loveliness.''' ,'''A beautiful thing never gives so much pain as does failing to hear and see it.''' ,]
