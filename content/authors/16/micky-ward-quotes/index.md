- Emotional hurt, you gotta let that go. Walk away and let it be. So many highs and lows, but if you keep being down, you'll never get up.
- I trained as hard as I could, I ran as much as I could, I sparred hard, I did everything right. I did everything I could possibly do at the age when I could fight. You have to be realistic; you can't say, 'Oh, I am smarter now, older and I can punch harder.' You think you can, but you can't.
- When things are good, you should be thanking God. I don't do enough of that. But if you get things, you should thank Him, not just take, take, take. He really listens.
- I always felt that if I did the right thing, that if I trained hard and worked hard, I'd be rewarded somehow.
- I never lost a fight because I wasn't in shape or because I wasn't ready. I lost because I was either beaten by a man better than me, or it wasn't my night.
- I don't watch every fight; I am not huge on watching fights on TV. Because I did it my whole life. But I do watch the big fights. I follow the little fights too, sometimes; I just don't have to watch every single fight that happens.
- I'm back in Boston. I own an outdoor deck hockey rink, and I own a boxing gym here also.
- You give to get. Whether it's helping someone or training a kid, I believe you will be rewarded in some way.
- I knocked a lot of guys out from the seventh round on - so if I gave up, I would never have achieved what I did. There was no giving up. It's weak to give up. The easiest thing in the world is to quit.
