quotes = ['''In many cases, the joy and honor of having a home has lifted people into a spirit of determination to try and achieve a better life for themselves and their families.''' ,'''Success: When you make more money than the rest of us, it hurts our feelings.''' ,'''Despite the fact that there was not one shred of evidence that George Zimmerman 'racially profiled' Trayvon Martin, America's liberals have literally taken to the streets to denounce a verdict that was, by all accounts, a just one.''' ,'''Education means teaching kids how to do stuff and how to think about stuff. Education is a pretty simple concept with a very clear way to measure results: you give some kind of an exam - maybe it's one of those standardized tests all kids hate, maybe it's some kind of essay, but whatever it is, it'll measure the results, and the kids will hate it.''' ,''''We don't torture' is the anguished cry of squishy people who have decided that trying to frighten terrorists by roughing them up is somehow the very definition of torture.''' ,'''Since I'm a professional communicator, I think I instinctively cling to doing what I do best, even in times of crisis and turmoil.''' ,'''While everyone of all political stripes are admitting that the surge is working and dramatically reducing the level of bloodshed in Iraq, Obama managed to complain that the Iraqis aren't spending as much in rebuilding their own country as a result of the surge.''' ,'''It's awfully hard to get into the head of a liberal. Instead of logic and reason, they are drawn to emotions and feelings.''' ,'''Getting to shake hands, pose for pictures, sign books, and interact with people who listen to our radio shows is a blast.''' ,'''I continually ask myself if a decision I'm about to make falls short in the eyes of God or my family or my colleagues. It's actually a pretty simple litmus test: am I doing the right thing or not? The answer is generally an easy one.''' ,'''There is simply no defending the preferred mode of travel for many of the celebrity crazies who lecture us about carbon credits. Do you think these folks are willing to give up their mansions and private jets in order to 'save the planet?'''' ,'''When school officials want to get a teacher out of the classroom, they have to go through an arduous and multi-year process involving hearings and appeals and lawyers and more hearings. All the while, the teacher draws full pay.''' ,'''People who are desperate for Barack Obama to win the presidency are capable of practically anything.''' ,'''After one election comes many more.''' ,'''I want to attract as many people as I can to listen to my show, and I don't expect everyone to always agree with me.''' ,'''The George Zimmerman/Trayvon Martin affair is one of the most important and clarifying moments in American history.''' ,'''The fact is that Democrats cannot stand dissent.''' ,'''Millions of Americans recognize the right of private businesses to donate to any cause they choose; that if one doesn't want to patronize a chicken sandwich business, one can certainly buy fast food anywhere they want.''' ,'''Donald Trump is clearly the underdog in this race. Just about every organized institution has thrown everything it has at him. And they won't stop until they get their wish, that Hillary Clinton will be sworn in on January 20, 2017.''' ,'''If there's a swarm of bees outside an open window, it might be a good idea to close the window, even if a few bees have already flown into the house. Somehow, Democrats who oppose shutting the border don't see the analogy.''' ,'''For millions of Americans, the continued incarceration of Jose Compean and Ignacio Ramos is a grim reminder of everything that has gone wrong with border security.''' ,''''Out of many, one' is the national motto, and what the Founders imagined it meant is that out of the great and celebrated differences between us comes one nation and one larger purpose.''' ,'''Let me get this straight: I can't defend the military because I didn't serve. So does that mean I can't support police officers or firefighters because I've never been one? How about teachers? Can I support them since I've never taught a class before?''' ,'''Football: War with cleats and pads.''' ,'''All of these 'protections' were put into place to provide public school teachers with the kind of job security and cushy work rules that United Auto Workers have enjoyed.''' ,'''We know how to take care of one another without whining and accusing and belly-aching.''' ,''''E pluribus unum' is perhaps the most obnoxious motto the Founders could have come up with, as far as liberals are concerned. They don't mind the e pluribus part - they love to note the things that divide and separate us. But they positively despise the unum part.''' ,'''The belief that government must be the ultimate nanny to our children is one of the fundamental philosophical disagreements between the Right and Left.''' ,'''All Israel wants to do is survive.''' ,'''Listener and reader input is every bit as important as anything any of us can say. We'd be like crazy people chattering in the middle of that empty field that Joe Biden thinks we should stand in to be safe from swine flu if it weren't for the calls, the letters, the blogs, and the reaction from our audience.''' ,'''That's the underlying tactic of the Obama administration in 2012: push the war on women, the war on the middle class, the war on gay people, and the war on Hispanics, and hope it will carry the day.''' ,'''After watching the shrill reaction from liberals to the George Zimmerman verdict, I am reminded about why I'm proud to be a conservative.''' ,'''I've loved traveling around the country and meeting people at book signings.''' ,'''If any person - white, black, brown or yellow - objects to having a police officer potentially ask them for their ID, it makes me wonder what that person is trying to hide.''' ,'''I often debate liberals on Fox News Channel who tend to start yelling and attacking when they run out of facts or common sense. I suppose these folks figure if they bow up and get in our faces, we'll just back down and see the world their way.''' ,'''I think you can be conservative and fight for what you believe in without being mean-spirited or bash people or be ugly about it.''' ,'''Oddly enough, Asians are a much smaller 'minority' than African Americans in this country. But because Asians are so successful, college admission officers don't feel sorry for them, so they are not a preferred 'minority.'''' ,'''The Left loves to demonize the financially successful.''' ,'''We simply have to reign in the piggish people and money-hungry lawyers who chase every ambulance they see and expect companies and individuals to pay for everything that goes wrong.''' ,'''The sheer genius of talk radio and Townhall.com is that the environment is so interactive.''' ,'''For people who never tire of telling the world what a moral high ground they've taken in opposing Donald Trump, they sure don't seem to mind offering up a bellyful of gloats and taunts.''' ,'''Public school teachers enjoy a huge amount of job security, thanks to their powerful unions and inflexible work rules.''' ,'''All I can think is that the owners of Chick-Fil-A have decided they have had enough, that they're just going to focus on selling chicken sandwiches to as many people as they can, and they figure that keeping their views about marriage to themselves is better than having a bunch of angry activists on your doorstep.''' ,'''I'm not fond of kicking a man when he's down.''' ,'''Want to fire up a liberal? Dare to suggest that a nervous looking young Middle Eastern man standing in a TSA line to get on an airplane should be scrutinized.''' ,'''You can't improve what you can't measure, and liberals have resisted any kind of meaningful measurement of success in the classroom for decades. Instead of focusing on the three R's, liberals have thrown up a barrage of silly things designed to distract us all from their awful stewardship of the schools.''' ,'''In 1972, former Texas Governor John Connally led 'Democrats for Nixon.'''' ,'''If a police officer is looking for a criminal, he or she might stop a number of people in that particular area and ask to see their driver's license.

We're just happy the cops are trying to find the bad guy.''' ,'''Yes, Barack Obama could easily be cast as an American president in a movie or TV show.''' ,'''While headlines are being generated about the Democrat mindset of nationalizing private businesses and bailing out failed ventures, we seem to be ignoring one of the most massive bail-outs ever: the taxpayer-funded process of transitioning people from analog to digital television.''' ,'''Michael Savage turns on a microphone and broadcasts his opinions to faithful followers who enjoy listening to his views on politics, social issues, and anything else that this colorful, provocative, entertaining guy comes up with.

Evil flourishes, but good men continue to battle it - and win.''' ,'''The global warming hysterics don't just offer opinions and beliefs about greenhouse gases and the like. These are people who speak as if they belong to a cult.''' ,'''I think the Republican Party is lost in terms of whether we should be stronger on the social issues or ignore the social issues. But I think the Rand Pauls, the Ted Cruzes, that's the future of the party.''' ,'''The failure to readily identify the battle between good and evil is a nagging, ongoing, dangerous pattern that shows no sign of easing up any time soon.''' ,'''Liberals love to screech about 'free speech,' but it's pretty clear to most of us that they don't really tolerate any speech but theirs.''' ,'''We are, after all, a nation of laws. And we live in a culture where carrying a form of identification is as normal as keeping your car keys in your pocket. When any of us walk into a grocery store and cashes a check, no one skips a beat when asked to present our driver's license.''' ,''''The Daily Show' is a cultural phenomenon.''' ,'''When you get John McCain going about the war against terror, he comes alive. That's when it gets fun. He rattles off the statistics, he showcases his wealth of military experience, and he doesn't recognize the concepts of defeat or surrender.''' ,'''One day before I die, I will finally understand why liberals, especially Jewish liberals, fail to fully support Israel in its right to survive terror attacks.''' ,'''The Kennedy family might be a lot of things, but for RFK, Jr., 'warm and fuzzy' doesn't exactly come to mind.''' ,'''It doesn't matter if one is live on-air or sitting through a commercial break.

You always have to be a pluribus.''' ,'''Maintaining America's role as the greatest nation in the world means we must stay the course.''' ,'''School systems now routinely have more administrators than classroom teachers.

It threatens to destroy the values and lifestyles that millions of us cherish.''' ,'''I've made mistakes, usually when I felt backed against a wall or faced enormous pressure. I'm human and flawed.''' ,'''Jesse Jackson is a master of the old expression that it doesn't matter what someone says about you as long as they spell your name right.''' ,'''Few news stories can demonstrate the stark difference between conservatism and liberalism like the George Zimmerman trial has done.''' ,'''Arlen Specter is a scoundrel.''' ,'''I wish I could understand why so many people have a nearly manic desire to excuse, defend, explain or condone evil.''' ,'''I yearn for the day when we'll return to the foundational value that makes this country great.''' ,'''Like it or not, liberal radio hosts fail miserably in the spoken word format.''' ,'''People on the Left get a pass when it comes to condemning white Americans.''' ,'''Sen. McCain isn't someone who strikes you as a particularly dynamic speaker. He doesn't seem to like the formality of giving speeches. He clearly isn't too comfortable reading off a TelePrompter.''' ,'''Liberals would prefer it if the bald eagle on the Great Seal was holding olive branches in both talons, or, better, an olive branch in one, and maybe a soft cushion in the other, to entice our enemies to lie down and snooze.''' ,'''Many activists and antagonists who are on the wrong side of an issue employ the tactic of, 'the best defense is a good offense.'''' ,'''Believe me, I bash liberals for being mean-spirited and angry, but there are plenty on my side who are the same way.''' ,'''The Great Seal has got it all - everything liberals despise is there, front and center.''' ,'''Every new revelation about the Obama Administration comes with the familiar musical notes of the Rod Serling TV classic ringing in my head: 'Do-dee-do-do, do-dee-do-do.'''' ,'''I expected a lot of flak over my new book, '50 Things Liberals Love to Hate' from, well, liberals.

The people supporting illegals don't know the meaning of the word.''' ,'''I cannot imagine what it must feel like to be treated differently because of the color of my skin.''' ,'''A lot of theatre people are definitely not conservative, but I don't think liberals get to own the culture.''' ,'''Liberals spend a whole lot of time trying to convince us they love teachers, but dig even skin deep into the matter, and it becomes evident that liberals hate teachers.''' ,'''The public can't be fooled all the time.''' ,'''For many impoverished people, living under a tarp or in a cardboard box is a way of life.''' ,'''I don't have the level of vitriol and hatred for the other side as some of my colleagues do.''' ,'''Air America has tanked because it features a bunch of talentless, angry demagogues who wouldn't know how to entertain a radio audience if their lives depended on it.''' ,'''If a natural disaster like a flock of birds or a bolt of lightning causes a plane's engines to fail, you know what should be expected?

That's precisely what Captain 'Sully' Sullenberger and the rest of his crew did.''' ,'''I'm not allowed to buy advertising for my book '50 Things Liberals Love to Hate' on Facebook because, according to their representative, they have received complaints about the word 'hate' in my book title.''' ,'''Schools insist that everything is under their purview - what your kids eat, what they believe, what they say on the playground.''' ,'''Oliver Stone might think he's a guy who chews with his mouth open and yells at the hired help, but the George W.

Can you imagine anyone even beginning to allow an advertising campaign promoting Islam, being endorsed and supported by a man the feds believe to be a terrorist, on New York City subways?''' ,'''I guess many of us are just prone to see what the other side is up to, maybe to reinforce our own worldviews and feel confident that our ideology is right and theirs is wrong.''' ,'''I'm fired up about TV converter boxes.''' ,'''Liberals instinctively cling to racism or bigotry or hate or narrow-mindedness whenever they can.''' ,'''For years, I have been criticized for supporting the military because I have no military experience. It's one of the craziest complaints I've ever experienced in over 30 years as a radio talk show host.''' ,'''If you asked a team of expert psychologists and sociological researchers to come up with a design that was sure to infuriate and offend liberals in America, they'd probably come up with what we call the Great Seal.''' ,'''America is full of success stories featuring victories by the underdog.''' ,'''The arrogance of the Left always fascinates me.''' ,'''Hamas, Hezbollah, and other Arab terror groups are committed to the destruction of Israel, a position supported by millions in the Muslim world.''' ,'''Evil is everywhere.
