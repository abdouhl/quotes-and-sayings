quotes = ['''I love horror movies like 'The Exorcist' and 'The Shining,' which freaked me out but in a good way. And I love gore.''' ,'''When I originally auditioned for 'Hereditary,' I didn't think I'd get it because everyone there was, like, three years younger than me and had red hair - it was a very odd thing. When I ended up getting it, I was really excited because it was on my bucket list to be in a horror film.''' ,'''TV rots your brain.''' ,'''Everybody experiences bullying in some way. It's not right, so we should stop it.''' ,'''I was at the grocery store just buying lemons, and a person turns to me and says, 'Hey, you're the kid in the horror movie, right? Can I get a picture?' It was really random.''' ,'''A lot of horror movies just look at how they can scare people, and no matter which character dies, you don't ever really feel enough to actually care.''' ,'''I remember when I was in 'Matilda,' we would have interviews in the day, and then we'd go to a show, and it's just, like, absolutely insane.''' ,'''I do watch a lot of horror movies, so not a lot of things scare me anymore.''' ,'''When I was three, I lived in Florida, and my mom took me to see the touring production of 'Cats.' And I was, like, absolutely silent - which for a 3-year-old never happens - and I turned to her and said, 'I need to do this.' That's when I started my performer journey.''' ,''''The Strange Thing About the Johnsons' is so disturbing but so good, because it went through a lot of things that you don't really see, ever.''' ,'''I've talked to ghosts once. For me, it makes sense for them to be real because of physics. In physics, you can't destroy energy; it can only be conserved.''' ,'''I've always wanted to die in a film.''' ,'''I just really like being with my sister.''' ,'''I love literally every animal.''' ,'''I love horror movies, and the kid is always such a big part. Kids are usually seen as so innocent, like, 'Oh, they can't do anything that creepy - they're kids!' That's what a lot of horror movies draw on, so getting to join that 'club' is really cool.''' ,'''Cake is a very beautiful thing.''' ,]
