I'm not ashamed to say that I need the world to validate me and for people to say, 'You are what you think you are.'''' ,'''If you take the duality of things - like sunny-sounding music with weird lyrics on it - it makes this dichotomy.

Everyone needs to challenge themselves like that.''' ,'''I love happy-sounding music.''' ,'''My Hippy' is filled with futuristic fashion, bright colors, beautiful camera work, trippy effects, and even has a cameo from the infamous 'Sunset Blvd Jesus.'''' ,'''The people that are feeding you the information on things that I like - love life, believe in yourself, be motivational, give your time to things and meditate - they're all older people who are well into their 50s and have had careers, and for me, at this point, I'm the young ambassador for this whole lifestyle of making your mentality a reality.''' ,'''I'm here to clean minds of negativity and build confidence in others.''' ,'''Bigger shows, songs on the radio, more people aware of what I'm doing... all that, I'm ready!''' ,'''Every artist knows the songs that come out naturally, almost effortlessly, are the songs that do the most.''' ,'''I think that the only pure thing we have in life is to try to be happy.''' ,'''I never wanted to be called a fan, and that's no disrespect to any artist who calls them fans, but I never wanted a boundary in between the people listening to my music and me - for them to feel like I'm doing something that they can't do.''' ,'''Growing older, boundaries between the artist and the listener are something that nowadays should be completely demolished.''' ,'''I don't want to travel around this world and have these kids treat me like I'm someone they're not, because I'm not doing anything that they can't do.''' ,'''I feel like at the end of your days, the last thing that's going to happen is that you're going to watch the movie of your life. It's very important to make sure that you love your movie and that you want to watch your movie, so I try to always make sure that I'm doing something fun and interesting.''' ,'''I'll never forget, I was talking to the singer in one of the heavier rock bands I was in, and it was like a screaming band, and I was like, 'Man, why don't we make a song that's like 'Let's Celebrate!.'''' ,]
