quotes = ['''I worry about a democracy having nuclear weapons as much as a dictatorship having nuclear weapons.''' ,'''The Muslim Brotherhood is a religiously conservative group. They are a minority in Egypt. They are not a majority of the Egyptian people, but they have a lot of credibility because all the other liberal parties have been smothered for 30 years.''' ,'''You're shooting yourself in the foot if you isolate or disempower the moderates.''' ,'''You either have a civil society or you don't.''' ,'''The U.S. engages with North Korea, so I don't see why they can't engage with Iran.''' ,'''The Egyptians have grown in confidence, they've tasted freedom, and there's no way back.''' ,'''It is going to take a long time to switch Egypt into a democracy.''' ,'''There is no religion that was founded on intolerance - and no religion that does not value the sanctity of human life.''' ,'''I am an Egyptian Muslim, educated in Cairo and New York, and now living in Vienna. My wife and I have spent half our lives in the North, half in the South. And we have experienced first hand the unique nature of the human family and the common values we all share.''' ,'''People talk about smart sanctions and crippling sanctions. I've never seen smart sanctions, and crippling sanctions cripple everyone, including innocent civilians, and make the government more popular.''' ,'''People feel repressed by their own governments; they feel unfairly treated by the outside world; they wake up in the morning, and who do they see - they see people being shot and killed: all Muslims from Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia, Sudan, Darfur.''' ,'''My sister-in-law works for a group that supports orphanages in Cairo.

They could be irrational in many ways, but I don't think they're irrational to the point that they're ready to annihilate their own country.''' ,'''Music gives me a lot of peace, either classic music with its structure or the spontaneity of Miles Davis. It brings the best in you.''' ,'''Everyone in the Middle East pretty much wants to come and be an American citizen, but pretty much everybody is angry with the U. S. foreign policy.''' ,'''The Nobel Peace Prize is a powerful message. A durable peace is not a single achievement, but an environment, a process and a commitment.''' ,'''The sooner we put Egypt on the right track, the sooner we would be able to have an Egypt that is modern, that is moderate, and that is acting as a beacon for freedom and liberty across the Arab world.''' ,'''I argue that for every country to have an independent fuel cycle is the wrong way to go. Because any country which has a complete fuel cycle is a latent nuclear weapons country, in the sense that it is not far from making a nuclear weapon.''' ,'''Well, I think we still have to verify whatever declaration we will get and make sure that it is comprehensive and accurate. So, that would take care of the past activities.''' ,'''Whether weapons exist in Iraq, Saddam Hussein or post-Saddam Hussein, it is a serious enough issue that require that we continue to go and make sure that Iraq does not have weapons.''' ,'''Your economic and social development is linked to the kind of regime you have.''' ,'''Only if you empower the liberals, if you empower the moderate socialists, if you empower all factions of society, only then will extremists be marginalised.''' ,'''I guess law was always interesting to me because you deal with constants. I like to deal with constants, abstracts, constants and reason and ration, rational approaches to things. I don't know, I never really thought why I wanted to study law. But if you ask me whether I would do it again, absolutely.''' ,'''Young Egyptians, gazing through the windows of the Internet, have gained a keener sense than many of their elders of the freedoms and opportunities they lack. They have found in social media a way to interact and share ideas, bypassing, in virtual space, the restrictions placed on physical freedom of assembly.''' ,'''I have, as you know, the utmost respect for President Obama as a person.''' ,'''All I know is, I think I would like to continue to do public service.''' ,'''Well, first of all, we now have everybody with the exception of India, Pakistan, and Israel, and I don't think these three countries are going to join by simply providing them an incentive, in terms of technology.''' ,'''Historically, Islam was hijacked about 20 or 30 years after the Prophet and interpreted in such a way that the ruler has absolute power and is accountable only to God. That, of course, was a very convenient interpretation for whoever was the ruler.''' ,'''Managing a country is like managing a company in many ways. It maybe involves more complicated issues, but it's the same skills.''' ,'''I hope everybody will go back to the negotiating table. I've always said this is the only way forward.''' ,'''I'm a lawyer.

If you treat them in a patronizing way, they will go out of their way to make your life difficult.''' ,'''We now have the right to have immediate, unfettered access to any site in Iraq and we have the right to interview people, both inside and outside Iraq.''' ,'''In a democracy, when you get 20 million people in the street, you resign.''' ,'''Challenging the integrity of the non-proliferation regime is a matter which can affect international peace and security.''' ,'''Egypt under Hosni Mubarak had deteriorated to the status of a failed state.

How can you sustain that?''' ,'''If a country is suspected of going nuclear, you need to understand why. Why does it feel insecure?''' ,'''Israel claims it needs nuclear weapons as a deterrent against any threat to its existence. The Arab world in return feels that this is an imbalanced system; there is a sense of humiliation and impotence.''' ,'''The globalization that has swept away the barriers to the movement of goods, ideas and people has also swept with it barriers that confined and localized security threats.''' ,'''You don't get the fox to be in charge of the chicken coop. You don't give the outgoing regime - which has been practicing dictatorship, is an authoritarian system, it's a bunch of military people - the task of changing Egypt into a second republic, a new Egypt with democracy, freedom, rights, etc.''' ,'''Democracy is more than a ballot box.''' ,'''You need to form a grand coalition, and you need to put your ideological differences aside and work together to focus on people's basic needs.

They really have to fight for their freedom whether I'm there or not.''' ,'''As long as some of us choose to rely on nuclear weapons, we continue to risk that these same weapons will become increasingly attractive to others.''' ,'''We still live in a world where if you have nuclear weapons, you are buying power; you are buying insurance against attack.''' ,'''If Egypt were going to change, it is going to change through the young people.''' ,'''In my view, stability only comes with a government that is elected by the people and works for the people.''' ,'''Even with the best intentions, you can have a nuclear war, a nuclear holocaust, through miscalculation, through accidents.''' ,'''You can't, in the 21st century, continue to live in a system where people live under martial law for 30 years.''' ,'''As much as we Egyptians treasure our military, acting alone it cannot provide the legitimacy to lay the foundations for democracy.''' ,'''It would be, in fact, very ominous if Iraq were to be able to get weapon-usable material, hydro-plutonium or highly enriched uranium from abroad.''' ,'''I hear that from so many different governments, people coming to me and saying, 'You should be careful'. But I don't want to go around with bodyguards.''' ,'''I'm not a good small talker. I'm not into small talk, frankly.''' ,'''I'm not a grassroots organizer; that is clear.

So Iran is no different than any other country. I mean, they are connected with the rest of the world.''' ,'''If a huge number of people call for change, the government will have to react. If you want to avoid uprisings, or demonstrations, you need to respond to the people's desperate need for change.''' ,'''I have a lot of interests in global issues, as you know, humanity, inequity, arms control, and I continue to be active on all these issues.''' ,'''The Israelis should understand that it is in their long-term interest to have a democratic Egypt as a neighbor, and that it is prudent to acknowledge the legitimate interests of the Palestinians and to grant them their own state.''' ,'''Everybody has to chip in, I think, and see how we can have a functioning system of collective security where we do not continue to face the threat of countries trying to acquire weapons of mass destruction or particularly nuclear weapons.''' ,'''The U.S. is not the holder of truth.''' ,'''So, we need to delegitimize the nuclear weapon, and by de-legitimizing... meaning trying to develop a different system of security that does not depend on nuclear deterrence.''' ,'''I feel relieved that we discovered that Iraq did not have nuclear weapons.''' ,'''I think we still have a chance if we continue with our work, if Iraq provides full cooperation, we should still be able to avoid a war.''' ,'''Iran's goal is not to become another North Korea - a nuclear weapons possessor but a pariah in the international community - but rather Brazil or Japan, a technological powerhouse with the capacity to develop nuclear weapons if the political winds were to shift, while remaining a nonnuclear weapons state.''' ,'''I think one country with nuclear weapons is one country too many.''' ,]
