- It is nice finding that place where you can just go and relax.
- I can see myself doing production work and handling projects behind the scenes.
- I was really shy when I was younger, so my mom got me into an acting class to see if I would open myself up more in front of an audience. Her plan was for me to just talk more.
- I've been acting since I was 10. At age 14, 15 and 16, it's difficult to find roles and to find yourself, even, and when everyone's eyes are on you, it's difficult.
- Not a lot of people make that transition from child actor to bigger, better roles.
- When I was a kid it was much more difficult. You're trying to understand what the director wants. It's a learning process. Now, you go in and it's more of a collaboration.
- I would absolutely be down to do something in Spanish.
