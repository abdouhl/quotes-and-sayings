- The most important thing with children is to give them your time. Actually, that's all that matters.

- I live in Paris but I feel I am a daughter of Europe.
- Because I'm pretty, everybody thinks I'm stupid. But it is like a mask, and you have to break the mask to show that there is something else behind it. You have to show who you are to make the others come to discover you.

True beauty is the slick of red lipstick my paternal grandmother would put on before going to church on Sunday.

- There is this thing in America where actresses reach 40 and go mad. The film industry wants all these young people.

- In a couple, sometimes, one or both people have to give up their personal life, dreams and ambitions for the good of the family.

- I have a lot of adrenaline. I have a naturally fast system. But I love to eat, and I am not skinny.

- When you see a silent movie, you understand everything that's going on from the images because the images are so strong.
- I speak a little Portuguese, but my daughter speaks it better than me. I always feel that Italy is my home, but it is important for my husband that we also live in France. Sometimes we live as a family all together, but as we are two working actors, sometimes we have to be apart. Sometimes I'm shooting a movie; sometimes he is.
