quotes = ['''Certainly, 'creativity' has been a vital plank of New Labour strategy. It not only hands out money with the enthusiasm of a Medici, but also invites the talented arts world into the very heart of government.''' ,'''Some Muslim lobby groups have argued that Christian groups already have public funding for their schools and services so they should too. In response, there are now Hindu and Sikh organisations demanding their own concessions lest they feel left out. The demand to wear the headscarf one day spurs the demand to wear the crucifix the next.''' ,'''But I do love working for Boris because he never stops. He's always fizzing with good ideas, and when you are looking after culture, that is important. He's quite ambitious for London.''' ,'''There is clearly a conflict within British Islam between a moderate majority that accepts the norms of Western democracy and a growing minority that does not.''' ,'''Black artists are encouraged to explore their identity but are then pigeonholed according to their ethnicity. We may have seen the decline of old racism, but we are witnessing a new kind of racialising.''' ,'''Britain has lots of celebrities who are well known and admired today, but we don't seem to have any heroes.''' ,'''Differences in racial outcomes are not the same thing as institutional racism any more than the fact that far more men than women are locked up is evidence of institutional sexism.''' ,'''I think that in the past there has been a kind of cultural resistance to Latin because it's associated with elitism.''' ,'''Often, when art from the canon is brought in to fine art classes, it is used as a prop to inspire art-making projects but more rarely as something to study in-depth for itself.''' ,'''Few, if any, political analysts predicted the Arab Spring. The raw energy of millions of protestors in the streets of Tunis and Cairo came as a surprise to many who believed that Arabs were essentially reconciled to their governments and non-democratic rule.''' ,'''The emergence of a strong Muslim identity in Britain is, in part, a result of multicultural policies implemented since the 1980s, which have emphasized difference at the expense of shared national identity.''' ,'''A school that believes in the power of knowledge and learning will have reading at its core.''' ,'''Brewer Street Car Park as the host venue is a brilliant development for London Fashion Week. With its position in Soho, it is at the heart of an area that has long been associated with fashion and creativity in general.''' ,'''The government should stop emphasizing difference and engage with Muslims as citizens, not through their religious identity.''' ,'''If black artists can win major commissions and international acclaim, why do we assume that to be black is always to be marginal, or in need of special support? We have to recognize how diversity initiatives can make black artists feel ghettoized and, as some cultural commentators have argued, bear 'the burden of representation.'''' ,'''In times of stress, it is easy to look to one's weaknesses and fear the worst, but it is worth remembering that London's cultural strengths are not some ephemeral dot-com bubble; they are a real, tangible legacy of decades of investment in talent.''' ,'''The idea that Veronica Wadley has no artistic credibility is just crazy. She has a strong reputation and when she was editor of the 'Evening Standard' she was very highly regarded in the arts sector.''' ,'''A contemporary artist like Grayson Perry is brilliant partly because of his expert knowledge of art history, not despite it.''' ,'''We're very proud of our cultural life. Culture is to London what the sun is to Spain. It's a major driver for our tourism.''' ,'''Culture is the glue that really binds, especially in cities with fast-growing populations.''' ,'''But everyone, including ethnic minorities, should be worried about how anti-racism is becoming weaponized across the political spectrum - how a lot of people in politics think it's a good idea to exaggerate the problem of racism.''' ,'''I think Londoners welcome a spectacular event.''' ,'''Government policies to improve engagement with Muslims make things worse.''' ,'''There is a sense of civic connection to the city when you light up iconic buildings or sites.''' ,'''Perhaps inevitably, media stories focus on differences, which exacerbates tensions; yet Islamic radicalization is, in part, an acute expression of broader trends that affect us all.''' ,'''There are people working in arts organizations who feel that in recent years there has been a sacrifice of quality and excellence in favor of ticking the right boxes and using the right buzz words because that's what their masters tell them.''' ,'''I've argued for a much less instrumentalist politicized approach, freeing up the arts and enabling them to deliver high-quality projects.''' ,'''It shouldn't be that people think the National Gallery is just for middle-class white people.''' ,'''No doubt many people working in race relations sincerely want to make things better. But by constantly drawing attention to race and policing ordinary behavior, they risk making things worse.''' ,'''There has been a genuine willingness from many in the arts sector to try to understand people who are not within the arts elite.''' ,'''The political elite prefers to see criminals as victims in need of therapy and TLC.''' ,'''The creative sector is incredibly important to London's economy in a number of different ways.''' ,'''I think that there is a tendency to underestimate the public.''' ,'''We need to have a view that culture has a value in itself, not just in terms of a social and economic value.''' ,'''We need law enforcement as the ultimate deterrent to stop irresponsible and rash young people from making mistakes that will harm others and themselves. Put bluntly, we need them to be scared of getting caught and of getting punished.''' ,'''You'd be surprised. A number of developers recognize that having a cultural activity in their space brings kudos. People like the idea of being near to creatives.''' ,'''Why is London particularly attractive for artists? It's partly this incredible concentration of organizations that have a long history but also the spontaneous and informal culture and the opportunities in London.''' ,'''We want artists to stay in London. It's very important culturally and economically, but there are lots of challenges in terms of finding space.''' ,'''Just as a city cannot protect its manufacturing base without keeping its factories, we cannot have a strong arts sector without studios, rehearsal space, and performance venues.''' ,'''We give money to the E.U. and they give it back according to the priorities they choose, with an unelected group of people choosing those priorities.''' ,'''By importing into the U.K. the divisive politics of anti-racism from America, with its demented campus dramas and neuroses about 'safe spaces', 'micro-aggressions' and 'cultural appropriation,' they make it almost impossible for people of goodwill of all ethnicities to rub along together.''' ,'''Public art is a unique type of art. It's very different to gallery art because it is something that we pass by every day and it inevitably creates a lot of discussion in a way that gallery art does not.''' ,'''I have met people who have received E.U. funding and regretted it.''' ,'''Studying art history is actually one of the few ways of getting a good job in the arts sector. It's hard to be a museum curator without it, work in any senior position in an auction house or gallery, or become a serious art critic.''' ,'''London centre has a wealth of creative activity but there are parts of London where there isn't a cinema or where library provision is quite weak.''' ,'''Too often, it is presumed that young people will only like art that they can immediately relate to. Working-class students may be steered towards popular culture like hip-hop, new media and film on the basis that they will find older art forms such as opera or ballet irrelevant.''' ,'''It would, of course, be wrong to say that the arts have no social value. They have tremendous power and can often, indirectly, make our world a better place to live in.''' ,'''There needs to be more schemes to help young people build careers in fashion, like apprenticeships.''' ,'''Paradoxically, just at the point when racist attitudes were declining in society and many ethnic groups were integrating successfully, our political leaders became obsessed with racism.''' ,'''After Brexit, we need to design a modern and fair immigration system which attracts talent and investment from the E.U. and the rest of the world.''' ,'''At the start of the 21st century, Britain is caught in a confusing riptide of anxiety. Of course racism still exists, but things have improved to a point where many ethnic minority Britons do not experience it as a regular feature in their lives.''' ,'''The growth of race relations management, diversity training and 'promoting good relations' has come at a cost. We are more sensitized to racism, yet far less confident in talking to each other as human beings with similar hopes, problems and aspirations.''' ,'''The most anyone could reasonably say about institutional racism is that the 'evidence is far from conclusive.''' ,'''For many there is a degree of constancy in our culture; London won't let you down.''' ,'''The 'Shoreditchification' of certain areas, although it's seen as a negative by some, has actually been very positive for parts of London.''' ,'''The people who fund the arts, provide the arts, and research the arts have all produced a consensus about the value of what they do, which hardly anyone challenges. But do the numbers add up? For all the claims made about the arts, how accurate are they?''' ,'''Paradoxically, by insisting on engaging with Muslims as a separate group, the authorities make many of them feel even more excluded.''' ,'''We could all do with a little more courage, frankly.''' ,'''Boris isn't known for his fashion credentials, but he knows what it represents - in London it's about creativity. That's why we invest in London Fashion Week each season.''' ,'''Londoners deserve a great, free music festival with excellent bands from around the world. They don't need to be hectored about why racism is bad or accosted by activists explaining why Castro is a hero.''' ,'''I don't think a good education should be confined to a privileged few.''' ,'''By appeasing the anti-racism lobby and affirming its culture of grievance, public institutions and business leaders are not making Britain a fairer place. In fact they are harming the very people they aspire to help.''' ,'''To challenge the dominance of identity politics, we need to champion an alternative universalist approach. This wouldn't mean bland similarity, with everybody talking and looking the same. Instead, it would help us challenge the imposition of formal, ethnic categories and allow us to develop richer differences based on character and interests.''' ,'''For so long, Arab culture has been misconceived by the western mindset as exotic, or more recently, as dangerous, so spaces like Mathaf are vital for asserting a sense of connectedness.''' ,'''At the same time women are putting on the headscarf, they are also going to work, to education, increasingly vocal in the media - and this is the confusing thing about Muslim women in the West,. They are becoming Westernized at the same time as they are adopting their religious identity more strongly.''' ,'''In capitalist terms, art is a global marketplace and artistic labour is too.''' ,'''We want young people to get every opportunity to experience culture, to understand it and to think it is for them.''' ,'''Some people think that culture is overhyped and peripheral. A season of opera is less important than the refurbishment of a school, they say. Leaving aside the poverty of imagination and aspiration implicit in such a sentiment, it also ignores hardheaded economic reality: Britain, and London in particular, makes big money from culture.''' ,'''There's a lot of concern that London is changing and artists are being forced to move to new areas.''' ,'''We need to keep telling people that London is great place to buy and to shop.''' ,'''Oxford is a very special place. You really sensed the value of a good education there.''' ,'''The politically correct illiberal left far too often side with the extremists.''' ,'''Of course, when people work together, there can be tension and disagreement. But policing informal behavior makes it hard for people to speak freely for fear they will say the wrong thing. Even self-aware individuals can doubt their judgement and start to rely on the diversity trainer to judge if something is offensive.''' ,'''Islamist groups have gained influence at local and national level by playing the politics of identity and demanding for Muslims the 'right to be different.'''' ,'''In cities across the world, directors of leading arts institutions, galleries and museums know that when it comes to attracting locals to their major exhibitions and shows, weekdays tend to be 'cultural dead time' for working people, who are simply too busy to enjoy what their city has to offer.''' ,'''Barriers today are largely class-based - income, networks, education. And those affect many white people as well.''' ,'''Too many developers still treat cultural strategies as a fig leaf to get planning permission, rather than make a thoughtful, genuine commitment to the cultural life of their areas.''' ,'''Sectarian political festivals are not the way Londoners want their money to be spent. Most of us, I suspect, just want to be trusted to get on with other people and not be instructed by activists about the dangers of racism.''' ,'''A civilised society ought to make ample provision for everyone, no matter their background, to enjoy the arts and culture.''' ,'''A hero usually rises above the ordinary because he or she exemplifies some virtue that everyone can recognize.''' ,'''If white people are constantly told how culturally different their Asian neighbors are, and if Asians are told to be vigilant against white racism, both groups might conclude that they have little in common and much to fear from their neighbours.''' ,'''Stop and search has a controversial history and has not always been carried out professionally by individual officers. Liberal-minded people are right to be wary about its overuse. However, it is also regarded by most people as a legitimate and necessary tactic.''' ,'''London can be a platform to look at what living in contemporary Britain is all about.''' ,'''Most Muslims are well integrated, want to live under British law and prefer to send their children to mixed schools. They do not live in bleak ghettoes cut off from society. Their religion is not a barrier to integration and is very often perfectly reconciled with being - and feeling - British.''' ,'''There is a large number of people who see immigration has been very positive and engaging with the world and cooperating is the future. It is the E.U. which stops us doing that sensibly and intelligently.''' ,'''A major step towards the universalist approach would be to dismantle the countless diversity policies that encourage people to see everything through the prism of racial difference.''' ,'''London's top colleges attract the best young talent from around the world; they're truly a national asset.''' ,'''We should get rid of 'tick box' measures that do nothing to address underlying inequality in areas like employment. And we should interrogate the claims of victimization made by some organizations to get their slice of pie.''' ,'''It's important that we challenge the culture of low expectations. You need to believe every child can do well.''' ,'''Museums and galleries do recruit art historians, but they are overwhelmingly white and middle class, or else from abroad. They understandably fret about the lack of diversity in their curating departments, but is it any wonder?''' ,'''Religiosity amongst younger Muslims is not about following their parents' cultural traditions, but rather, their interest in religion is more politicized.''' ,'''As a transplanted northerner, London has always signified big-city glamour and cosmopolitanism. It's part of what drew me here after university.''' ,'''A lot of my work involves criss-crossing London to visit the many hundreds of projects, theaters, galleries, museums and groups that comprise the capital's astonishingly rich cultural life.''' ,'''A well-run, well-stocked library with access to great books as well as the Internet is essential.''' ,'''Being falsely accused of racism is, at best, unpleasant and at worst, can destroy a career.''' ,'''There's been a kind of inverse snobbery about culture. I get the feeling some people would look at Shakespeare and say, that's a bit too intimidating for working-class people.''' ,'''We are the most visited city in the world - and they're not coming for the weather. Culture is one of things that's made London hugely successful.''' ,'''I realized very quickly that the main thing that the left was not in favor of was free speech - that there was an intolerance about different ideas and opinions.''' ,'''Throughout history, cities have been associated with incredible bursts of creative energy - the Renaissance in Florence, or modernism in Paris. London is the cultural metropolis of the early 21st century.''' ,]
