- I am such an indoor person.
- When I'm out and people ask me what I do for a living, the worst thing you can say is, 'I'm a singer.' It opens up a can of worms.
- I have a big family full of massive personalities so i just sit there most of the time great fun to listen to their stories.
- I had a few teachers when they would hear a noise they would immediately be like, 'Nadine, outside!' I spent about two years standing outside the physics classroom.

- Lip balm can double up for taming the brows, too.
- I'm generally quite active and try to squeeze in a workout when I'm waiting for stuff. Like if you're cooking dinner, try to squeeze in a few squats or a few yoga moves. Or if you're brushing your teeth. You know, just trying to do more than one thing at once.
- A baby adds more stress to a relationship - you're up all night and it really is a test. Everything changes. You can't just go for lunch or dinner or a drink. That goes out the window, and you're dealing with the serious stuff.
- The entertainment thing - you're there to entertain, it's not about you - I get that, but for a while I lost my opinion.

- Louis Walsh, he made me audition for Girls Aloud, he said, 'If you don't, I won't speak to you again.' I was like, 'We don't speak that much anyway.' I went and it all worked out well, I wouldn't have gone to the audition if it wasn't for him.
- The press likes to create cat fights with girl bands.

- I just think of me in a supermarket planning what I'm going to cook for the evening, and buying maybe a bottle of wine, getting excited about putting on my new CD. That to me is, it's a lovely, nostalgic feeling. Everybody needs to eat and live and shop, after all.
- Right after I had Anaiya, I definitely wanted more kids. I was like: 'I think I could do this professionally.' Because I loved being pregnant so much.
- I'm just not a huge romantic type and getting married is a hugely romantic gesture.
- Around the time that Girls Aloud was at its biggest, I was offered some huge acting roles in America. I decided to stay loyal to the band rather than take those other opportunities. Sometimes I wonder whether I should have just taken them.
- I tend to go with the flow and that flow can end up in great places or not so great places.

- Girls Aloud is not just us five, there's like us five plus a ridiculous team of 50 who travel with us, it's amazing.
- I love the live shows when they're on and all singing great but I hate it when the judges say bad things about their singing. I feel sick because I feel it is mean because I've done the reality TV thing so I have such strong memories of what it feels like and I just imagine how bad and how nervous they must feel.
- I'm one of those people that to be a singer you can just walk around the house and sing, you don't have to be in a studio or on a stage.
- In Girls Aloud, there's always someone there to help out, to jump in on difficult questions and to moan with about how hard we're working. That camaraderie isn't there when you're solo.

- I've only been blessed with one talent, unfortunately, and that's being able to sing a wee bit.
- Money is far more important to me than love because ultimately it lasts longer.
- It was fine at the start but there's always politics in any band. It just happened that I always got more vocals than everybody else, so in terms of people wanting their voice heard, that wasn't happening. It made people, very bitter.
- I mean, I didn't feel, as part of Girls Aloud, that my opinion wasn't heard, or they went and did certain things and I had no say, or we had no say.
- I have a very good, close circle of friends, I keep it positive. Obviously there is the negative stuff, but you've got to let go of it. You can't get bogged down in the details of anything, otherwise you'd drive yourself mad.
- I think it's down to our songs - we've always made sure every song on every album works.

- I remember the days beginning at sixteen, seventeen years old in Girls Aloud. Nobody knew us, nobody cared. We'd do university shows and people threw beers cans at us. All sorts of crazy things! We had to work really hard to get where we did.
- I'm not a particularly healthy eater. But I am 100 per cent fit and healthy and I am the right weight for my body type.

- I do like to do mad stuff on occasions.
- I was born and raised in Derry and I can't change the way I talk.
- I rarely do shows just by myself, I've had vocalists or musicians so I can look at them and connect - and say 'can you breathe... do you need a water?'

- I absolutely love Haim, they are so talented! I adore them because they are 3 sisters and I've two sisters. I think we should be in a family band together too like Haim.

- I am scared of so many things.
- Some rules are stupid.
