It's the most important achievement.''' ,'''I have made enough money to secure my family and that is all I care about.''' ,'''If you are ambitious you can have a moment of glory but it will most likely be temporary. But talent always finds its way out.''' ,'''I learnt early to have little expectation so I protected myself from ever feeling greatly disappointed.''' ,'''I completely admire my mother for raising a child with cerebral palsy at home.''' ,'''My appearance gave me access to a particular kind of world and I'm really grateful for it.''' ,'''I know what it's like not to have food in the fridge or money to buy more.''' ,'''When I remember my life in Russia it is in totally dark colours.''' ,]
