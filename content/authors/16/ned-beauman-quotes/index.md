- Plot is tremendously important to me: I can't stand books where nothing happens, and I can't imagine ever writing a novel without at least one murder.
- I was always determined that one way or another I would force a book on the world, even if I had to resort to writing one about a tabby cat who solves mysteries.

- I'm very finicky about when I'm in the right mood to write. So most days, I find some excuse not to do anything.
- There's never a bad time to put earplugs in. They're the kind of thing you can reject as a bit lame, but somebody told me to do start wearing earplugs and it turned out to be great advice.
- I read 'The Good Soldier' by Ford Madox Ford again every so often.
- I don't have a day job, so I read any time of day.
- Just as the best way to judge an adult is by his or her record collection, the best way to judge a pub is by the albums on its jukebox.
