- I used to go to my kids' soccer games and I was the only parent who wasn't screaming, because I'd have to do a show that night. It was hard. Moms and dads get more emotional at those soccer and Little League games than at a professional game.
- I like having a woman. I like having someone to come home to, to make all of the hard work feel worth it. I need someone with me. And I want someone.
- I've looked at photographs of myself during concerts and it sometimes looks as if I'm in a fencing move, with a guitar in my hands instead of a sword.
- Chelsea Morning is a great Joni Mitchell song and I guess I'm partial to her lyrics because they show me a slightly different perspective on life.
- It's very difficult for me to say 'I love you' but to sing 'I love you' for me is easier.
- I think probably Australians have just a little more taste than most people.
- When you're on a merry-go-round, you miss a lot of the scenery.
- Songs are life in 80 words or less.
- There's a mystery to writing, and you don't really know where most of it comes from.
- I'm throwing myself back in because I like being married. I don't want to end this whole fabulous journey alone. I want someone by my side who I love and who loves me. I've finally found somebody who's up to the task of being my wife, because I'm very high maintenance.
- You can't plan to write a great song. It just happens to you. It drops in your lap. It's the same thing with a woman.
- I still need practice in enjoying the fruits of success.
- Brooklyn is not the easiest place to grow up in, although I wouldn't change that experience for anything.
- Songwriting is different from music, although I don't deny now that it would be nice to have a little more background in music theory.
- The main objective in any song, the songs that I write, has always been that it reflect the way I feel, that it touch me when I'm finished with it, that it moves me, that it can take me along with it and involve me in what its saying.
- I don't feel I have to write deep and meaningful songs; they can be light and meaningless. It has to do with the place I am in my life, a really good place.
- It was a real hand-to-mouth existence in those early days - I'd have whatever dry cereal there was in the house for breakfast, 30 cents to spend on lunch and a hot dog for dinner. I did that for years. So there was definitely a hunger in me, of various kinds, to succeed.
- I've always thought of music as something which gives the words their flight and their wings and the music often comes first, although sometimes I'll have a concept, a title idea, a lyric idea that I want to write and the lyric will come first.
- Performing is the easiest part of what I do, and songwriting is the hardest.
- I may have a little bit of a talent for music, but I've learnt to tap into my own self when I write. When I put the drill bit inside my heart, sometimes I come up with something light and frothy, sometimes with something deep and painful, but it's great to connect with the audience.
- If it can affect me, if it has meaning to me, if I feel I can do it well, I will do it and record it and thats why I recorded these songs.
- Songwritng is what I do.
- I'm lucky. Hard work is the key, but luck plays a part.
- I came back to performing with a different attitude about performing and myself. I wasn't expecting perfection any more, just hoping for an occasional inspiration.
- I don't like all of the music to be serious and deadly.
- I didn't want to repeat my mistakes so I stopped, took some time out and started having therapy. My songs were bringing up feelings inside of me I didn't really understand, so I wanted to understand where they were coming from to help me be a better person and a better songwriter.
- Because my musical training has been limited, I've never been restricted by what technical musicians might call a song.
- No, I majored in biology, in a pre-med program.
- The cardinal rule for any performer is that they should know themselves before they enter the spotlight, and I didn't. I was just Neil and I did what I was supposed to do. I was supposed to get married, so I got married. I was supposed to get a job, so I looked for work.
- I definitely don't feel like I'm 71. I feel like I did when I was - between 30 and 40. The body ages. The mind doesn't.
- When I need my wife or when I need companionship or someone to talk to, I need it, like, now. So my wife will have to give up whatever she's doing at that moment to tend to my needs. And, in the same way, I would tend to hers. That's not such an easy thing to do.
- Song Sung Blue took a lot of compressing and refining, and it has one of my favorite lyrics.
