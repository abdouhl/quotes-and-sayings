- When you're young, you don't have any experience - you're charged up, but you're out of control. And if you're old and you're not charged up, then all you have is memories. But if you're charged and stimulated by what's going on around you, and you also have experience, you know what to appreciate and what to pass by.

- The cutthroat avenues of rock 'n' roll, I am fed up with. I don't want anything to do with it.
- I don't like to be labeled, to be anything. I've made the mistake before myself of labeling my music, but it's counter-productive.
