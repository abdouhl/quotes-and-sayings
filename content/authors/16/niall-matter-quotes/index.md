- I'm not of a science background, I was never a comic book geek, and I was never a gamer.
- I'm an intellectual, but I've always had jobs that required physical labor above all else.
- I started off as a director, so when I see other actors directing, it gives me hope that maybe they'll put me into that position at some point, too.
- I'm a little bit of a gypsy myself. I've always had jobs where I'm moving around and I'm not sure what's going to happen tomorrow or the next day.
