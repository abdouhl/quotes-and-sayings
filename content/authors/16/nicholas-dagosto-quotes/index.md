- 'Heroes' was such a big production. When I was there in the second season, it had been expanded so much. Fans of the series will remember, and many of them were upset about it, but they had expanded so many new characters that they were actually running two different units.
- I'm realizing for the first time, your life goes on while you're trying to pursue this career. I saw my career as everything. But you have this life, too. Living your life fully, you come to know yourself better. You'll find the place for it.
- What's funny about my resume is so much of what I've done has not been seen.
- When I was 17, I had a small part in the movie 'Election,' which shot in Omaha, Nebraska. I was really naive at the time; I really didn't know what a big deal it was.
- I want to be doing smart, fun, complex characters like most actors want to do.
- I'm growing very talented at watching blood and guts on screen because I have zero emotional response.
- You wake up one day and realize, 'Now, I'm a veteran.' You just wake up one day, and you're like, 'I'm 35, and I've been doing this now for 13 years.'
- I like going to museums and stuff, but I also like going out and doing lots of physical activity like camping and hiking. I like doing stuff that I've never done before. Curiosity is a big thing. Usually it means that people are intelligent and that they want to learn stuff about the world.
- I'm very thankful I'm finding my way, and people are excited to bring me into roles that demand a certain complexity.
- One thing I wasn't quite aware of is that when you are extremely outnumbered by a lot of girls, and they become comfortable, it is outrageous what kind of stories they tell behind closed doors.
- I moved out after college, and I started working right away, and I've been working ever since.
- When I meet a girl, I just sort of do really over-exaggerated terrible dance moves... a lot of hip movements. I get them laughing, and get them to feel pity for me, and then they like me!
- I think... as an actor, you never want to overspeak about something because, frankly, you want people to be excited about it but still have relatively low expectations so that people will feel better about it.
- The acting of the '50s is really stylized, so you're not really getting a lot of authentic, everyday characterization of people.
- I think one of the hardest things about 'Final Destination 2' is that nothing's immediate about it.
- The business can be frustrating. For me, Omaha is a rounding foundation. I was raised in a very faith-filled household, very hardworking. It made me aware of what privilege is. And it's a place I can go back to, spend time with nieces and nephews, celebrate the things that have nothing to do with the hubbub of Hollywood.
- I wanted to be a priest when I was really young.
- I came from a very conservative Catholic family.
- You know that thing when you're not asleep but you're not awake, and you can't move your body? I had that kind of nightmare, and I felt like all my teeth were crumbling in my mouth. Now I have this fear of all my teeth being knocked out of my mouth somehow!
- Every time a film comes together, usually the studio executives come up for a day to the set. If you're out of town, they'll fly in or wherever you are - the cast, the director, the producers - all get together and have a big dinner and celebrate the fact that we're about to start shooting.
- I can be serious, too, but I'm a goofy guy, so I like doing crazy things.
- In the summer after sixth grade, I took a class at St. Robert Bellarmine. My first role, I was the villain in a play, and I forgot all my lines. I think I cried my way through the performance.
- I've had nine failed pilots. I've been doing TV for a long time.
- I'm happy to be working as an adult.
- I had never done anything like I had done in 'Masters of Sex.' Those are some very adventurous scenes.
- At the end of the day, an actor has to just play what's in front of him.
- I've learned an enormous amount about the business itself, about what it takes - the stamina and the dedication and the diligence - to succeed out here... And I'm very, very thankful, and I have a wonderful career, but it's hard work... I'm very comfortable with who I am as an actor now and excited to try all kinds of things.
- For being such a dark city, 'Gotham,' it's a really, really sweet group of people, very welcoming.
- I can get incredibly angry, to the point that I get ashamed of my actions.
