- The action stuff is only good if you get the character stuff in there as well. Sometimes that get lost in amongst all the trying to make stuff blow up.
- Nowadays we have so many things that take our attention - phones, Internet - and perhaps we need to disconnect from those and focus on the immediate world around us and the people that are actually present.
- I think all teenagers feel alone, and that nobody else knows what they are going through and all that sort of stuff.
- I'll eat anything. I ate antelope once in Swaziland. I didn't know what it was until I'd started chewing it. Everything tastes like chicken though doesn't it? It wasn't bad.
- The paparazzi don't care about me.
- I think if you set yourself specific goals, that's quite a lot of pressure.
- I don't want to share my worries - that's for me to know.
- I want to get more muscly.

- My mum always says work goes in waves: you have a good spell and then it dips.
- I manage to live pretty normally.
- Anybody who has a problem with 'Skins' obviously doesn't understand teenage life.
- I'm not scared of growing up, but it just happens, doesn't it?
- As a kid, when you're in a film with somebody, you look up to them, you know?
- I try not to be too optimistic or pessimistic. If you're a pessimist then that's depressing all the time; if you're an optimist and things don't work out then that's depressing, too.
- A lot of child actors keep acting for the wrong reasons.
- I've realized why I don't tell the truth in interviews. It's because they're printed months later, and you change so quickly - you have new thoughts, new everything - so people are reading an old version of you.
- I don't really have disappointments, because I build myself up for rejection.
- I just want to be a better actor. You can always get better.
- As you're growing up, it's odd, because directors don't expect you to grow up. They think you'll be young forever, but as an actor, there is an awkward period when you're too young for old or too old for young, and it can be an odd time.
- It's awkward going to parties with people you don't know, especially when they think they know you.
- I'm kind of feeling ashamed now that I never get bullied. Everyone keeps asking me, but I don't, and it's kind of annoying. I wish I could say I did get bullied, because then everyone would feel sorry for me.
- I won't eat veal, and my mum won't eat lamb, because she thinks it's a bit harsh to eat cute things.
- I don't think parents always know where their children are going or what they are doing, what they are up to.
- I can be a bit grumpy. I'm full of angst, and hormones.
- When you're on TV and in people's houses - it's great that anybody watches anything you've done, but you feel as though you're being watched by Big Brother sometimes. Even if people have no idea who you are, you get the feeling you're being watched.
- Supposedly I'm impossible to talk to. But it's honestly not me being difficult. Sometimes you just don't have a lot to say.
- Occasionally people will look at me and do a double take and they'll look at me like they're trying to think where they know me from.
- By the time I was 14, I was about six foot. I remember going into auditions, and they'd look at how tall I was and say, 'Well, you're taller than the lead actor, so there's no way we can cast you.'
- I'm not one of those people who sits around knowing all bands and going to gigs all the time.
- When I like something, I love it, but then I'll let it go completely.
- The lead actor, along with the director, plays a big role in what the vibe will be on set, and that's a huge responsibility.
- After 'Skins' I became mildly famous, which was a bit of a disaster.
- It's a scary life and sometimes you think you'll never work again.
- I always like to keep busy, otherwise my brain starts ticking.
- I don't mind my eyebrows. They add... something to me. I wouldn't say they were my best feature, though. People tell me they like my eyes. They distract from the eyebrows.
- Other people's success spurs me on to do well and gives me motivation.

- Life's too short for regrets.
- If you're out, and starving, and need a bite to eat, then you need fast food.
- I think interviews can be fine. It's just there's this terrible fear of coming off wrongly or saying something that gets taken out of context.
