- I've never, never not enjoyed playing 'Halo.'
- I have an amazing partnership with Red Bull.
- I wouldn't have a career if it wasn't for the 'Fortnite' Community.
- There is a deeper connection with streamers and viewers than any other celebrity or influencer - I'm live 12 hours a day; that's half my day I'm sharing with millions of people.
- I would play GameBattles matches. Anything competitive is always going to get you more viewers. When there's something on the line, it's just more exciting to watch.
- When I'm not streaming, I have time to reflect on all the growth, and I don't like that. I'd rather just be home playing. I'm like, 'I haven't played a celebrity in a while. I haven't done something big in a while. Is it because I'm slowing down?'
- TwitchCon is something that I look forward to all year because it gives me an opportunity to see what's in the pipeline and meet up with some of the best the industry has to offer, like DrLupo.
- I never feel awkward, ever, when I'm eating! If someone doesn't want to watch me eat? Dude, they can leave - I gotta get my fuel. My justification is, would you rather me end my stream and come back two hours later cause I went out to eat, or just eat real quick in between a match?
- It's exciting to see a brand like Hershey's is getting into the gaming world.
- Sometimes I'll go for some Panda Express or a light margherita pizza.
- I'd already been using the Uber Eats app for a long time - and it's super simple to use. That's just what I look for when I go into partnerships. If something comes to me that I've never used before for a potential partnership, then it doesn't feel real or natural. This one is a match made in heaven.
- If I have one conversation with one female streamer where we're playing with one another, and even if there's a hint of flirting, that is going to be taken and going to be put on every single video and be clickbait forever.
- I don't play with female gamers.
- I know how to put on a good show, and being a top player is always a way to get fans.
- 'Fortnite' really is just the perfect storm of a game. You have the fact that it's free to play on almost every platform, and everything about the game is enjoyable.
- I think that Amazon made an incredible play with the Twitch purchase.
- I always played videogames my entire life.
- You can't just drop everything and focus on playing video games for a living.
- Competing and streaming 'Fortnite' all night at the most iconic building in Chicago, a city close to my heart, is a dream come true.
- You want to stop playing 'Fortnite,' man, because you aren't having fun anymore? Good. Go watch someone else. Go play another game.
- I think that what streamers have is a direct connection to their audience. Imagine if LeBron James or Michael Jordan could interact directly with their audience every time they went to work.
- I feel like Drake saw that I was up-and-coming in the gaming scene, and he thought it would be a perfect way to just tap into another source of viewers by playing with me. He also might have just wanted to game. I'm not sure.
- Gun skill is never the main reason why someone is talented at a game. It's literally their decision making.
- I'm confident that no matter what game comes out, I'll be able to play at a top competitive level.
- The more ways you can tell a story and paint a picture, the better it is.
- 'Fortnite' is cartoony, if you want to use that word, and that's going to a good turn-on for parents when they see their kids playing a game like that.
- I don't feel famous.
- There's, like, a little move back in the 'Halo' days, whenever you were getting chased, if you went around a corner and the guy followed you, and you jumped over his head and, like, backsmacked him. It was called like 'the ninja.'
- People can just put their cash away and continue to make money and never give back because they just do not care, but I immediately felt obligated to use my influence for good things.
- So many people get content. So many people stop when they're at the top. They'll let someone take their place because they're relaxing. That's not going to happen.
- I don't like to lose at all.
- Amazon creating GameOn could be a very good introduction into competitive gaming.
- It is very difficult to 'make it' as a top broadcaster or YouTuber.
- I don't think anyone thought it was possible to get this big through livestreaming.
- People need to be true to themselves, and if entertaining and content-creating is something that does not come naturally and is really difficult, they should find something they are passionate about and love and do that instead.
- I'll take a couple of breaks for some food, but other than that, that's pretty much all I do is play videogames and practice with my team.
- I've done stuff with Bud Light, but do I want to take on a beer sponsor knowing most of my community is younger kids who can't drink? There are still a lot of people over 21 who watch. You're never going to hit your exact target audience.
- I usually try to go for meals that aren't heavy when I'm playing for a long time. I'll try to stay away from carbing up too hard - so I avoid pastas.
- I can 100 percent compete at the top level in every game that I play.
- It's definitely clear, when you're playing a game like 'PUBG,' there's this realistic warzone feel that they're going to get; there's a little bit of blood - no gore - and you get that 'Call of Duty' war feeling.
- Obviously I love Sony; I love PlayStation. I've been playing them my entire life.
