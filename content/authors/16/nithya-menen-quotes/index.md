- Being an actress does not mean that each thing that happens in my life has to be news or meant to be shared with others. Acting is a profession, and once I leave the sets, I want to be left alone.
- Your heart and your instincts are far more reliable than your brain. When you follow your heart, you can be sure you won't regret it later. Even if you calculate your every move, it's not like life ever goes according to plan.
- I've never wanted to be an actress. I came into the industry to be a filmmaker, but let us say fate had other plans for me. I don't want to be the next glamour queen.
- I think they call every actress 'bubbly' most of the time!
- After I finished my degree in Mass Communication in Manipal, I enrolled for a cinematography course in Pune Film Institute. That is when Nandini Reddy, the director of 'Ala Modalaindi,' convinced me to act.
- We should be actors rather than trying to be a lead; it will create a healthier atmosphere.
- Having a good actor as co-star is always a pleasure, as it gives you space to perform. It's nice to work with nice actors.
- The second you become an actress, people take the licence to make many assumptions about you. You're in trouble if you interact with a director/actor. You're in even more trouble if you don't. When I started out, a single YouTube comment would make me sad for days, and I'd wonder how people could say such nasty things about me.
- I am not very fond of spotlight or even, for that matter, money. I appreciate the small things that give me joy. The most precious forms of happiness often come from things that money cannot buy.
- I've been blissfully ignorant about the result of my films and don't get swayed by success or failure.
- Journalism is not what it used to be. I thought it was an important job, but it is not. I'm idealistic, and it pretty much upsets me that negativity sells and that even if I wanted to tell the truth, I wouldn't be able to if my boss does not okay it.
- I am not a trained singer, but I love to sing.
- '180' is a romantic film, but I don't think it can be classified as a fluffy love story. It is a wonderful story with a script that is layered and more complex than the normal ones.
- The Malayalam audience knows me as an art film actress, and I am fine with that because I know that such films come from the heart. It's difficult to do them, but the satisfaction you get is immense.
- At one point, I wanted to be a wildlife photographer. I also love to travel, so maybe I'd do travel writing.
- Acting was not on my agenda. It just happened by chance. I always wanted to be involved in wildlife protection or maybe surrounded by kids. I love animals and children.
- Had acting not taken off, I would've been glad to become a teacher.
- Soundarya was always respected, and she is looked at in a certain way that I always would like to be looked upon as an actress.
- It's not in every film that you connect to the role.
- I fell in love at 18 when I was in college, and that's probably why I know what it's like to be in love, and I can express it in a better way.
- My cinema is of a different kind: give me a good meaty role instead of two or three songs and running around in foreign locations wearing itsy-bitsy costumes. I'm clear and focussed about my priorities.
- I don't think I am really awesome. I think I have basic qualification to be an actor.
- I am not bothered about if my role in a film is small or big. Because if the character I am offered is sensible, I would do it even if it is small.
- I studied journalism, though I never really became a scribe.
- I'm serious, in general, and I guess I cling onto the little freedom I have offscreen. Having said that, I am funny and, at the same time, detached from a lot of things in life.
- I am not intellectually choosy. My choice of films reflect who I am, but it is not done with strategy and planning. I hear something and go by my intuition.
- For me, a story has to have characters, and my role should be meaningful. At the end of the day, people should say that they like my performance.
- I think acting is my destiny. I did my first film when I was just eight. However, I never took that role seriously.
- I was honoured to work with Amol Gupte. He is a brilliant person.
- People in Andhra Pradesh treat me like a girl next door after 'Ala Modalaindi.' I feel at home here.
- I'm often asked how I portray the roles I play so convincingly and express so much through my eyes. Quite frankly, I don't know how to explain that. I guess it's about who I'm as a person; I radiate it through my eyes.
- As an actor, it's really exciting and challenging to play a character which is much older than your actual age.
- Acting is emotionally draining, so I make it a point to not do anything when I am home.
- I am not an actress who only wants to do lead roles.

- I've always looked forward to do something different in all my films.
- Nobody goes to college and learns anything.
- My part as an actor ends on the last working day. I think the success or failure only really matters to the producer or whoever it matters to. For me, when I finish the film, I'm done, and if I'm happy, that's that.
- All of us just go to college and waste our time and to pass our exams. So just learning journalism does not mean I'm good at it or any of the journalists are, either. There is no difference; it's just class, and it's just college.
- I'm not insecure. Give me a good role, and I'll perform even for a multi-starrer with half a dozen other heroines!

- As an actress, I should be able to do all types of roles.
- I wanted to do journalism, as I was an idealist. Then, in my second year of journalism, I realized that in real life, things don't work the way you expect them to. I realized that I could express my ideas better through films.
- I don't see gender when I look at the world.
- I must tell you that Telugu film industry is one of the most comfortable places I found a woman can be. They do make a lot of mass films, but from my experience as an actor, I can tell you that people are very nice and welcoming. In fact, it's slightly more difficult in other places.
- I'll never forget the dance number that I shot with Anushka. The choreography involved a lot of intricate dance moves. I'm at least 7 inches shorter than Anushka, so I had to wear the highest heels I've ever worn in my life; throughout the song, I even injured my knee a couple of times.
- I'm not really interested in doing a Bollywood film.
- I will not accept a role just because a big hero stars in it. I am not here to merely dance, run around trees, and be a glam doll.

- Films were always there at the back of my mind. I would try to move away, but films kept coming to me. I would do movies for friends. I guess some things are meant to be!
- I try to choose characters that are very different; I think I have succeeded in that. A big role or a small one does not bother me at all. What matters is that I should have a rapport with the director.
- I was eight years old when I was offered a film. And before I knew it, I was acting in Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil, and Telugu movies.

- When they say 'action,' I am into it completely and forget everything around. When they say 'cut,' I am back to myself.
- When I first heard the 'Urumi' script, I was surprised, shocked, and excited. It was a strong script with a reference to the past. It had fact mixed with fiction. To incorporate facts into a film and introduce fictional characters was interesting. I loved the script.

- I don't belong to any social network, and I don't even message much. In fact, most of the time, I don't even use my mobile phone.
