- There are so many great messages in 'Good Trouble.' I'm just excited to be a part of it.
- 'To All The Boys' is one film amongst a couple other romantic comedies through the decades that promotes... I don't know what they're calling it. A modern man? A man that's more emotionally accessible and available and willing to communicate and actually care and nurture.
- I've always wanted to hit that, like, '13 Going on 30;' 'Failure to Launch,' Matthew McConaughey; 'What Happens in Vegas,' Cameron Diaz, Ashton Kutcher' wave.

- When I'm with someone, I give them my time, and I give them my energy because I like making someone feel loved! And making them laugh, and just, like, being there with them.

- When I go on a hike, I leave my phone in the car.
- There's something so great about platonic intimacy.
- I think, for a lot of people, the point is to get high engagement and likes on their photos, so I think it's just good marketing. But at the same time, if you're posting pictures and you look nothing like your pictures, then it's false advertising.
- If you love someone - like, truly love someone - I don't think that ever goes away. But what does change is your perspective on the relationship and the dynamic.

- I love being sentimental and remembering things. I literally am a sentimentalist.

- It's hard to find a writer that really understands the intricacies of flirting and the development of love, the development of getting to know someone, the development of chemistry in real life.
- High school is cool, especially that first-love mentality. That's what 'Sierra Burgess' captures is, like, his first moment of love. That's what I love. I like that innocence.

So I stopped doing all that, and I found that a lot of problems I was having in my life, slowly, they didn't go away: they just became way more apparent to me.
- To me, words convey feelings, and feelings are just vibrations that we feel, so words are never as authentic as what feelings are and what intentions are.
- I would say one of the most romantic things I've done is I've taken a girlfriend back to her hometown when she hadn't been back for years. It was in Puerto Rico, and we stayed there for about a week and a half. She showed me the different places she grew up around.

- I know myself. I'm not gonna be a mathematician or a professor.

- I went to New York for work. I was at baggage claim, and I had my headphones on, and I was waiting for my bag to come out. I feel a presence approach me, and without even knowing, I had to side step and take my headphones off, and there's, like, four people looking at me.
- If I ever feel like I'm messing up, making the worst decisions, or I'm just lesser than - if I'm being self-deprecating - I just think, 'Cheer up, dude, you're a lot worse than you think.' It makes me laugh. It takes me out of it.
- We are from a swipe-right generation, and that just comes to, 'Oh you're cute, let's hook up,' and that's that. Where is actual, genuine connection that comes from spending quality time with someone?

- Ever since I've been a kid, I've always been about running around, climbing trees, exploring.
- I think when you're young, being in love for the first time is like this fantasy.

- I was at the AMC Century City movie theater with my mom, and we were walking through the lobby, and these girls came up to me, and they said, 'Are you Dallas from 'Austin & Ally' - and I was like, - yeah, yeah. And they were like, 'Can we have a picture with you?' and I was like, 'Yeah sure of course.'

- Life kind of forces us to put these filters on, whether it's because someone told you you weren't good enough - excluded you or bullied you. Or maybe your parents screwed up on accident in some way and it changed who you were. There's this pressure to fit into a mold and change who you're supposed to be.
- I think there's been this whole image of masculinity that's been out in society - of brooding, brutish, egotistical, narcissistic men - like, this patriarchy.

- I love Bon Iver. I would never put a negative connotation on that man's name!
- Somehow I made it onto a show and then another show, and now I'm doing my thing. So, how did I start? Because my sister wanted to be a model, and I was dragged along to support her!
- I think Selena Gomez seems like one of the coolest people ever. And she's, like, an activist as well, and clearly she loves love and is a loving person. I don't know if it's clear because I don't know her, but it feels that way.
- I've always played the love interest. I've trained for it for a while. These roles are just molds I can pour myself into.
- I just want to keep being involved in great projects that push positive messages to people.
- I definitely have that bug; I'd really like to do some auteur, existential pieces, darker films, something that's really reflective of life. But I also love the genre of rom-coms, and I don't see myself completely detaching from that.
