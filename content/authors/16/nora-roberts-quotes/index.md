- I loved the process of writing.
- I long for typical days, but rarely get them any more.
- I find I use the Internet more and more. It's just an invaluable tool. I do most of my research on the Net now - and certainly do the bulk of my communicating through email.
- Every single book is a challenge.
- My own sense of family, where I came from and what I made for myself is an important part of my life.
- Actually, I find it great fun to develop family series with lots of characters.
- Aren't most romance heros, or heros in fiction of any kind, generally superior to real men? Same goes for heroines and real women.
- In the summer of '80, Silhouette bought my first book.
- I don't think you can write - at least not well - if you don't love stories, love the written word.
- If you write in category, you write knowing there's a framework, there are reader expectations.
- I would hope that my writing's cleaner than it was when I started.
- You don't find time to write. You make time. It's my job.
- One of my greatest pleasures is falling into a story someone else has written.
- I read a lot - and I read a variety of genres.
- I'd always loved to read - and come from a family of readers - but I never thought about writing as a career.
- The most important aspect of any story, to me, is character.
- I generally write a first draft that's pretty lean. Just get the story down.
- Certainly the plagiarism, and dealing with the fallout of it, was the most difficult thing I've ever faced since I started writing.
- And each book has to receive your best effort every single time. No slacking.
- I believe strongly in writing groups such as Romance Writers Of America that offer support, information and networking.
- I don't fiddle or edit or change while I'm going through that first draft.
- Action, reaction, motivation, emotion, all have to come from the characters. Writing a love scene requires the same elements from the writer as any other.
- Love and magic have a great deal in common. They enrich the soul, delight the heart. And they both take practice.
- I've gotten to know a number of readers from being online, and really treasure the time I've spent with them.
- For over a year I continued to submit mss, and have them rejected - the last few with rejection letters indicated the story was pretty good, but I was American.
- I don't base any character on a real person, and really don't do composites either. I make them up.
- I decided to write category romance as I'd recently discovered them, and enjoyed them.
- I don't believe for one moment you can write well what you wouldn't read for pleasure.
- I need to write to be happy.
- Mary Stewart will always be my goddess. I can pick up one of her early books - one I've read a dozen times - and still slide right into the story.
- Every writer has to figure out what works best - and often has to select and discard different tools before they find the one that fits.
- I do indeed write on the road. My laptop goes with me everywhere.
