quotes = ['''Unless it's done superbly, as in the Japanese film Gate of Hell, color can be a very distracting element.''' ,'''And so my militant philosophy is this: to make with a brush on canvas is a simple direct delight-to make with the movie is the same.''' ,'''The number of strokes to the inch controls the pitch of the note: the more, the higher the pitch; the fewer, the lower the pitch, the size of the stroke controls the loudness... the tone quality is the most difficult element to control, it is made by the shape of the strokes.''' ,'''I like black and white films. I don't exactly know why - probably because there is a stylization which is removed from actual life, unlike a color film.''' ,'''But it has, in addition, an even more precious quality - a consciousness of the human intelligence, the human spirit and that man is a social creature.''' ,'''By drawing or exposing two or more patterns on the same bit of film I can create harmony and textual effects.''' ,'''I have tried to preserve in my relationship to the film the same closeness and intimacy that exists between a painter and his canvas.''' ,'''Animation is not the art of drawings that move but the art of movements that are drawn.''' ,'''In any art movement, the art has to move into a new phase - a filmmaker has a desire to make a film that is not like a previous film.''' ,'''Take a film of Jacques Tati like Mon Oncle which has something quite new - for me, unique - in it.''' ,'''The process of art evolving is always one which has fascinated me.''' ,'''I don't know whether it ever comes back to the same thing; it does return to the spirit of a previous period in some way, but it's different, it's new.''' ,'''Well rounded forms gives smooth sounds; sharper or angular forms give harder and harsher sounds.''' ,'''Film is changing, and it can't help but keep changing.''' ,'''So people will come along and do new things and sometimes return to the spirit of an earlier age.''' ,'''The good moral work of art should have all the qualities that a good amoral work of art should have, such as formal unity, balance, contrast, and a sensitivity to the material out of which it is made.''' ,]
