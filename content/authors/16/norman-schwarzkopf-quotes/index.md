I never will be.''' ,'''As young West Point cadets, our motto was 'duty, honor, country.'

But truth be told, if you want to declare victories, I can tell you the fish have won a lot more than I have. It's interesting that something with a brain the size of a fish's can outsmart us humans, who think we are el supremo.''' ,'''If Saddam were to be replaced tomorrow he would probably be replaced with someone who's just as bad or worse than he is.''' ,'''An awful lot has been written about my temper.''' ,'''Nobody can ever pin you down when you speculate.''' ,'''When placed in command, take charge.''' ,'''I do hunt, and I do fish, and I don't apologize to anybody for hunting and fishing.''' ,'''Unfortunately, if you've ever been in southern Georgia on the beaches in a lightning storm, if you're out there, you're in great, great danger, and you can be killed very, very quickly.''' ,'''It takes a hero to be one of those men who goes into battle.''' ,'''I'm not a politician.

Absolutely, I hate war.''' ,'''The truth of the matter is that you always know the right thing to do. The hard part is doing it.''' ,'''Hey, I'm not a politician. I'm a ham. I love to give speeches.''' ,'''True courage is being afraid, and going ahead and doing your job anyhow, that's what courage is.''' ,'''I can't even begin to visualize myself as a five-star general... When I think of the people who are five-star generals, I can't even see myself standing in their shadow.''' ,'''Well, unfortunately, I have always regretted the fact that I have a temper, but I also have, you know, have great love and respect for all of the people that have worked for me. I think like everything else, this is one of those things that has been blown out of proportion.''' ,'''It doesn't take a hero to order men into battle. It takes a hero to be one of those men who goes into battle.''' ,'''I may have made my reputation as a general in the Army, and I'm very proud of that.

It's the being there that's important.''' ,'''You can't help but... with 20/20 hindsight, go back and say, 'Look, had we done something different, we probably wouldn't be facing what we are facing today.'''' ,'''Fish are a renewable resource, and one of the problems we've had is people feel obliged to catch the limit, then throw 'em in the garbage can.''' ,'''What is postwar Iraq going to look like, with the Kurds and the Sunnis and the Shiites?
