- England is really important to me, and the only way I can stay in there is by playing well.
- To be in the England squad, you have got to be playing well and your standards have got to be up there.
- I get on with Joe Hart really well. He joined Birmingham on loan when I was there and to see him working day-in, day-out was brilliant. As I've progressed I've tried to model myself on him.
- I'm confident about playing on the big stage.
- The most important thing for me is being part of a successful England squad and being as big a part of it as I can.
- It's a good thing isn't it, having competition? I enjoy it.
- I've been very lucky to have great support around me.
- I won't kick up a fuss and I will always be a team man, but ultimately I want to play.
- You've got to do your homework, and you've got to look at what makes people successful, what makes penalty takers unsuccessful. Ultimately, they're the ones kicking it, so how can you transfer the pressure on to them? How can you disrupt their pattern to make it difficult?
- All I can focus on is playing as many games as I can at the highest level. If that leads me to the World Cup, then brilliant. It's certainly a target of mine.
- It is obviously wonderful to be linked with a club with the history of Liverpool.
- My ambitions are to be the Stoke number one and England number one, but there are other things I want to achieve in my career as well.
- I was doing up to 10-12 hours a week sitting on a train to get to training but it was something I needed to do. But I still passed all my GCSEs - two As, six Bs and a C.
- I do want to play at the top.
- I know my dad would have loved me to have played rugby. He was a No. 8. I started off playing centre and ended up playing at the back of the scrum, No. 8 as well, just picking it up and running with it.
- The Champions League has always been a target of mine. I do want to play at the top.
- I'm at Stoke, I'm enjoying it, it's not my fault and I shouldn't be discriminated against just because who I play for.
- I don't know how many 19 year-olds are playing in the Championship, there's certainly not any playing in the Premiership. It depends on what type of character you are really.
- I've dealt with bigger things than the odd performance, dealt with a hell of a long time out of the game from an injury which shouldn't have kept me out for that long. I've had to deal with fears of not playing again, I'm a bigger man for it and I will be better for it in the future.
- I hardly had any coaching until I joined Birmingham where I had Dave Watson for five years. He's one of the best and I knew how important that was for me.
- I am not someone who enjoys being on the bench.
- There's no reason why we can't win trophies at Stoke, we'll try and win some cups and do as well as we can, but I obviously have ambitions.
- I want to become the best goalkeeper in the country and the best goalkeeper around.
- As a goalkeeper it's so important to be in the right position to come and clear those through balls, to make those right decisions.
- I have learned in football that you can't trust anyone and if you listen to what everyone says, more often than not it doesn't happen. So when I'm told 'so-and-so are interested' or 'such-and-such have done this' I don't get caught up in it all.
- I love watching the Six Nations.
- When I am No. 2, and I am working as hard as I can, then quite often the keeper ahead starts to raise his game even more.
- I've played for England Under-21s, in the Under-20 World Cup and I've been part of the play-offs in the Championship. But in terms of helping my career and getting me ready, going to Cheltenham Town was a massive experience.
- Coming to Stoke was a chance for me to develop and take my game to the next level.
- I want to be playing in the Premier League.
- You've always got to back yourself.
- I've experienced tournament wins with younger age groups and I know how good it feels - it's about carrying on.
- For me, playing for my country is the ultimate honour, and I've been fortunate enough to do that through many of the age groups. It's something that will never get old or boring for me.
- I feel I have experienced pretty much everything I can in football, winning, losing, the injury side and all the set-backs.
- We used to go cycling as a family every weekend. I played basketball, cricket, badminton, and was half-decent at them.
- If you get a career-threatening injury your career is done and you need something to fall back on. But if it wasn't for football I would have played rugby, if it wasn't rugby it would have been basketball and I would have just gone through all the sports.
- If I could wish to steal anyone's attributes whose would it be? Good question. Maybe not a specific attribute, but if I could replicate the longevity of Buffon's career I'd be a happy man.
- As soon as I was given the opportunity at Stoke it was head down, this is what I want. This is where I want to be, this is my opportunity and I was fully confident about taking it.
- The Olympics has solely been around other sports as far as Great Britain has been considered.
- I've been fortunate enough to play at all the age groups but I'm not eligible for them anymore.
- I had a fantastic time at Birmingham and I never regret anything that happened there.
- As a goalkeeper experience is a massive thing, and there is nothing better than playing games, which thankfully I managed to do at the Olympics.
- It can be a lonely place when you are injured. You miss being out there with your team-mates and just experiencing the highs and the lows.
- I wasn't a goalkeeper until I was 13 or 14 so before that, my heroes were the likes of Paul Scholes and David Beckham, but since becoming a goalkeeper, I've obviously trained with Joe Hart.
- I'm massively passionate about playing for my country.
- I am very proud to represent my country and the honour of being captain.
- Communication is something that I find if don't do, I will go missing, I won't be fully focused. If I'm constantly giving messages to the defenders not only do they know where they are but I am switched on and in the right position. It all links together.
- I had dreams of being a professional rugby player.
- We can only control what we do on the pitch and what we do on the training ground.
- I want to test myself, playing with the best and against the best. I can do that at international level, so that's my target and what I want to reach.
- I played rugby until I was 15, 16 and I eventually had to say, 'No, I have to choose one' and it was obviously going to be football, I miss playing rugby a lot.
- Regardless of what happens, I want to be part of a successful England team and if I have to swallow my pride and disappointment at not being the number one, then I've got to do that for us to be successful and obviously to help whoever is in goal perform at their best.
- I've played for England, played in the Olympics and made my Premier League debut.

- I love playing any sport.
- Sometimes you have a good game and mentally you are very tired.
- I'm always confident in my ability; you have to be as a goalkeeper.
- We are a rugby family really. My dad and both granddads played rugby. Dad was good, on his way to Bath until he broke his leg. My brother Harry got an invitation to go and play for Bristol. I go and watch Sale Sharks and have been to Twickenham a few times.
- We have to be aware of our profile all the time now, there are cameras everywhere. It can be difficult at times, we are young men after all. But we know we have to be careful. We have to be responsible.
- Whether you play or whether you're on the bench, or however it may be, at some point in your career you will be one of those three roles. You will either be a young, up-and-coming goalkeeper watching the experienced one, you'll either be on the bench or you'll be in goal yourself.
- I don't prepare to sit on the bench, I prepare to play because you never know what is going to happen.
- I would have liked to have played more but injuries are part and parcel of football and you've got to shoulder it, got to take it on and get on with it.
- We all know the power of social media, things can get out there so quickly. We are high-profile footballers, we know that.
- It's difficult to get away from the media, from social media. It's a big thing in society and in football, in particular.
- I like to feel I'm mature, consistent as a keeper and I pride myself on my shot-stopping and the presence that I have.
- Of course, I want to play for England as often as I can and at major tournaments.
- I want to play in the Champions League and I want to win trophies.
- I am enjoying the opportunity to play in the Premier League.
- I learnt at the Euros that that is the level I want to be at. That is where I want to be. The standard of the strikers there was top class. That is where I want to be for a long period of my career.
- Ask any keeper what it's like when there's a recognised No. 1, the competition might not be as high. You're after that competition because it drives you on further.
- You reach sometimes when you're at the lowest and times when you don't know if you are going to play again or when the next injection or operation might be. There are sometimes when you are at rock bottom. That's when you need people around you, at the club, the fans, little tweets on social media to give you some reassurance.
