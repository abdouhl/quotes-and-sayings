- I am not the hero of this film. It is Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy. The story is related to him. That doesn't mean that 'Kshetram' is a devotional subject. The climax scenes will have the audience in tears. No, it is not a sentimental drama either. Devotional values have been interspersed with commercial elements in this film.
- When I consider a part, I understand that it will not be as important as that of the hero. My only criteria is that it has significant potential, at least that of a second-in-command.

- Once I started 'Nagaram Nidrapotunna Vela' I had to finish it. I made a wrong decision. I knew the film would be a flop and told the producer so. Everyone failed - director, producer and all.
- Legend' is a stylised film. The character I play is a complete egoist. He cannot tolerate anyone touching him or slapping him. Whenever anyone antagonises him, he becomes cruel. That's how the 'war' between the hero and him starts. It's a solid meaty break for me!
- It feels nostalgic and emotional to shoot with Ilayathalapathy Vijay as it rekindles some beautiful memories of how his father SA Chandrasekhar and my father VB Rajendra Prasad teamed together to make some good films.
- At one point of time, I was jobless, and was too lazy to even trim my beard and dye my hair. I let them grow, without any conscious thought of doing so. That's when I decided to do a photoshoot, and well, you won't believe this, it worked big-time for me.
