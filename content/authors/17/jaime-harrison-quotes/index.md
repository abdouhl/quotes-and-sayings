quotes = ['''To campaign in the South is a unique cultural experience. You go into the little church facilities and meet people, or you go to a spaghetti supper, and it's about talking and hugging and shaking hands.''' ,'''Leaders must lead.''' ,'''I grew up in Orangeburg, South Carolina, which has the proud distinction of being the home to two of the eight Historically Black Colleges and Universities in the state: South Carolina State University and Claflin University. When I was a kid riding around town with my grandfather, we often drove by the colleges.''' ,'''I headed off to Yale, and eventually Georgetown Law, but I never forgot where I came from. I came back to South Carolina to teach 9th grade social studies.''' ,'''America can win the global energy race of the future, but only if we act boldly. We can and should seize the massive economic opportunity of leading the world in clean energy, by making investments that would create countless high-paying jobs and clean up our air and water in the process.''' ,'''Lindsey Graham can't lead us in any direction because he traded his moral compass for petty political gain.''' ,'''I grew up in a household where a missed day of work meant bills were not paid, I've lived through the stress that confronts many South Carolina families.''' ,'''Medicare should be allowed to negotiate with drug companies for lower prices on prescriptions.''' ,'''Small businesses are the heart and soul of South Carolina's economy - from our bait stores to our restaurants and barber shops.''' ,'''I know what it's like to lose your home. I know what it's like to be hungry. I know what it's like to lose a family member because of a lack of health care. So all of these things aren't just political issues for me. All of these things are personal to me.''' ,'''People are tired of the politics of Donald Trump. l really do believe that.''' ,'''I'm hoping that college students and young professionals in general will pay very close attention to what is being said by both parties and all the candidates in the parties and pick the best person that best reflects the values that we all have.''' ,'''I've picked butter beans, okra, watermelon, cantaloupe, honeydew. I've butchered pigs, chickens. We made our own sausage and pudding.''' ,'''I think about the world that we leave behind for our children.''' ,'''I don't come from a lot of money.''' ,'''I know what it's like to dig in the couches to find a quarter or two to pull together so you can get a gallon of gas and your grandfather can go to work. That is not something defined by whether you're a Democrat or Republican.''' ,'''The coronavirus is not causing our health care problems in South Carolina. But it will likely make them worse - and increase the burden on working people - if we don't take action in a decisive way.''' ,'''Growing up in Orangeburg, I didn't know that I lived in the 'corridor of shame.' I was the son of a single mom who learned to read from comic books. My grandparents helped raise me.''' ,'''Am I a Democrat? Yes, I'm a Democrat. But at the end of the day, when I take the oath as a senator it won't be to do the bidding of the Democratic Party or a president in the White House. I will be there to fight for the people of South Carolina.''' ,'''South Carolinians don't back down from challenges.''' ,'''No one helped my grandparents when a con man stole our house, or when I needed help paying for a plane ticket to get to college. But my community always had my back.''' ,'''We have seen communities cry out in pain, generation after generation, because of racism and police brutality.''' ,'''I support DACA, which prevents the deportation of undocumented immigrants who came to America as children. Congress should cement this program into law by supporting the DREAM Act, which has overwhelming bipartisan support.''' ,'''There are people of all colors and creeds across our state who've lost faith in our political system.''' ,'''Lindsey Graham has wavered on this, but I won't: We need to ban offshore drilling. A spill off our beaches would destroy jobs and harm the coastal environment that makes South Carolina beautiful.''' ,'''I think for young people, there are so many issues, not only student loan debt but health care and all these various issues that I believe can impact the quality of your life.''' ,'''Unemployment relief from The CARES Act - a popular and bipartisan solution - was a key lifeline not just for our families but also for small businesses.''' ,'''I know Democrats who have written Lindsey Graham checks.''' ,'''The Democratic Party has to transform itself. We can't just pop up every two or four years and hope people will support us.''' ,'''South Carolina needs a Senator who cares about South Carolina, who fights for you, who understands and feels your pain, and works to address it.''' ,'''I can tell you as a black person in South Carolina whose grandparents grew up through Jim Crow, when you lose the courts and justice no longer becomes just, we're in a world of trouble.''' ,'''I was in middle school when Hurricane Hugo hit in 1989. I still remember the sounds from that night and the challenges of recovering.''' ,'''Folks here in South Carolina want someone with a backbone, with a spine. Someone who's going to stand up for them and their families, regardless of who's in the White House.''' ,'''No, I absolutely do not support defunding the police. But it's clear we have been investing too much in force and need to reinvest in understanding and serving our communities.''' ,'''With a crisis as complex as coronavirus, multiple government agencies and departments are involved in responding. There needs to be one qualified and experienced person who will make sure every relevant cabinet secretary, agency director and policy advisor are on the same page - day in and day out.''' ,'''I've worked cornfields.''' ,'''We don't need more government, we just need the government we have to work smarter and more efficiently.''' ,'''Democrats believe in a New South because no matter your race, immigration status, income, religion, sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity, we all have the same aspirations for high-quality education, jobs, neighborhoods, health care, and retirement.''' ,'''Our leaders cannot and should not give up when compromise seems out of reach, especially when the economic security of South Carolinians is at stake.''' ,'''South Carolina's lack of access to quality maternal health care is pervasive.''' ,'''State governments should not have to compete in bidding contests against each other in order to get the necessary supplies to protect and help their citizens.''' ,'''In 2020, no child should go hungry, and yet, in South Carolina 1-in-5 children do.''' ,'''The reality is that front-line workers like restaurant servers, bus drivers and retail store clerks - whose jobs require person-to-person interactions - do not have the luxury of being able to 'work from home.'''' ,'''There's Lindsey Graham 1.0 and then there's Lindsey Graham 2.0. I could not beat Lindsey Graham 1.0.
