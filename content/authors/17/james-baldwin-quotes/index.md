It is a mystery, containing, like all mysteries, the possibility of torment.''' ,'''No people come into possession of a culture without having paid a heavy price for it.''' ,'''There is a 'sanctity' involved with bringing a child into this world: it is better than bombing one out of it.''' ,'''Nothing is more desirable than to be released from an affliction, but nothing is more frightening than to be divested of a crutch.''' ,'''The future is like heaven, everyone exalts it, but no one wants to go there now.''' ,'''The writer's greed is appalling. He wants, or seems to want, everything and practically everybody, in another sense, and at the same time, he needs no one at all.''' ,'''I imagine one of the reasons people cling to their hates so stubbornly is because they sense, once hate is gone, they will be forced to deal with pain.''' ,'''Life is tragic simply because the earth turns and the sun inexorably rises and sets, and one day, for each of us, the sun will go down for the last, last time.''' ,'''Most of us are about as eager to be changed as we were to be born, and go through our changes in a similar state of shock.''' ,'''People are trapped in history and history is trapped in them.''' ,'''If the relationship of father to son could really be reduced to biology, the whole earth would blaze with the glory of fathers and sons.''' ,'''The power of the white world is threatened whenever a black man refuses to accept the white world's definitions.''' ,'''It is a very rare man who does not victimize the helpless.''' ,'''It is only in his music, which Americans are able to admire because a protective sentimentality limits their understanding of it, that the Negro in America has been able to tell his story.''' ,'''To be sensual, I think, is to respect and rejoice in the force of life, of life itself, and to be present in all that one does, from the effort of loving to the making of bread.''' ,'''When one begins to live by habit and by quotation, one has begun to stop living.''' ,'''There is never time in the future in which we will work out our salvation. The challenge is in the moment; the time is always now.''' ,'''If you're treated a certain way you become a certain kind of person. If certain things are described to you as being real they're real for you whether they're real or not.''' ,'''Every legend, moreover, contains its residuum of truth, and the root function of language is to control the universe by describing it.''' ,'''Fires can't be made with dead embers, nor can enthusiasm be stirred by spiritless men. Enthusiasm in our daily work lightens effort and turns even labor into pleasant tasks.''' ,'''To be a Negro in this country and to be relatively conscious is to be in a rage almost all the time.''' ,'''There are few things more dreadful than dealing with a man who knows he is going under, in his own eyes, and in the eyes of others. Nothing can help that man. What is left of that man flees from what is left of human attention.''' ,'''When a man asks himself what is meant by action he proves that he isn't a man of action.

Love is a battle, love is a war; love is a growing up.''' ,'''It is a great shock at the age of five or six to find that in a world of Gary Coopers you are the Indian.''' ,'''People pay for what they do, and still more for what they have allowed themselves to become. And they pay for it very simply; by the lives they lead.''' ,'''The South is very beautiful but its beauty makes one sad because the lives that people live here, and have lived here, are so ugly.''' ,'''The reason people think it's important to be white is that they think it's important not to be black.''' ,'''The price one pays for pursuing any profession, or calling, is an intimate knowledge of its ugly side.''' ,'''It is certain, in any case, that ignorance, allied with power, is the most ferocious enemy justice can have.''' ,'''The most dangerous creation of any society is the man who has nothing to lose.''' ,'''The questions which one asks oneself begin, at least, to illuminate the world, and become one's key to the experience of others.''' ,'''Nobody is more dangerous than he who imagines himself pure in heart; for his purity, by definition, is unassailable.''' ,'''Europe has what we do not have yet, a sense of the mysterious and inexorable limits of life, a sense, in a word, of tragedy.
