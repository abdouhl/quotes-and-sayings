- When I moved to L.A., I had somebody go, 'Alright. Fix your hair. Wear this.' Like, changed my look a little bit. I kind of came into myself a little better when I moved to L.A.
- I decided I should go after the roles I like, that I am inspired by, and then, if I am having a good time, chances are that people will like watching you.

- As an actor, you always think your last job is your last job, and you're always doubting yourself and worried that people will see you're a fraud.
- A lot of guys I know are into this whole scarf trend. Not my thing. I prefer to update and personalize my style with the smaller things, like a pocket square or, again, with the shoes. All in the details.
- It's hard enough to just be a good actor. When you're on set, there's everything going against you. There are walkie talkies going off, the camera is creaking and moving, there are boom mics, and you have to hit your mark and make sure you don't shadow the other person's face. It's a really technical process.
- No one forgets their first love. You're experiencing all those endorphins and all that dopamine and that obsession with one another for the very first time in your life, so it makes it that much more cute.
- I've said this before, but I've always felt more comfortable playing the guy who thinks he's the hot shot or thinks he's the greatest and is so far from it, you know? The misguided character. That's always more interesting to me - especially with a comedy. I've always felt inside more like a character actor.
- Every time I read a script, I see the movie in my head, and I try to see the best movie in my head because everybody interprets the movie differently.
- I didn't know what my passion was until I discovered the dramatic arts in junior high and high school and I realized, 'Oh, I like this. This is something I feel like I'm good at.' But, the idea of moving to Hollywood and becoming an actor was really unrealistic.
- One of the big struggles for an actor is sometimes you have to take work that you don't necessarily want to do so you can pay rent.
- I prefer face-to-face conversation as opposed to texting. You need to go out of your way to spend good time with one another; you need to have a date night. Whether you have kids or a career or whatever, for a relationship to thrive, it's about making time for each other.
- I was with my wife for five years before we got married. At some point, she was ready to take the next step, and I would say, 'I'm committed to you now; nothing's going to change.'
- I have always been good at auditioning, but maybe because I had a good trick at the beginning. I would pretend that my agent gave me the wrong scene or lines. They would take pity on me and hand me the right scene. I would act like I had never seen this before - and then do pretty well considering I had already rehearsed it.
- I've done some films that, on paper, were really interesting and special. And for some reason, when they got on screen, it just didn't work. Well, I didn't get to watch the film before I decided to do it.
- Early in your career, you feel like there is a formula, a path you have to take. You have to do this movie because this person directed it and you have to be associated with these people. In some ways, I have thrown that out.
- As an actor, you can go in, and you give your best performance, but if you hand that performance to ten different directors and ten different editors, you get ten different movies.

- When you're making a film, it's a very technical process. You do things over and over again, and you have to hit your marks and your light and all that stuff.
- When you have kids and get older, it goes beyond flowers and chocolate. It's about waking up with a baby, letting her sleep in, and making a coffee for her when she wakes up. To me, being romantic is putting someone else first and thinking about what makes them happy.
- If you're lucky enough to pick what you do, that's the greatest career you can have. Ultimately, that's my goal: to have choices.

- Over the years, I've learned that you can have fun with the fabrics and other elements, but if it's not tailored right, you'll blow it.
- In Oklahoma, the girls like the big football players. Girls were more interested in those guys, and I was, like, kind of a drama kid.
- James Dean has never been one of my guys. I don't want to be him. I will take boring anytime. I love boring! Are you kidding me? Matt Damon has been one of my favorites forever. He always elevates every bit of material, and then you don't hear a thing about him.
- I never felt that I was a leading-man type in high school. I was always the goofy guy who was getting attention from girls who could make them laugh by doing impersonations of, like, 'Saturday Night Live' sketches... I was more James Stewart than James Bond.
- Women pay attention to how men drive because it's a good indicator of what kind of character you have. They want someone who's going to be intelligent and cautious and assertive and confident when you need to be, but not overly aggressive and reckless, and also not timid and overly paranoid.

- I've always loved watches my whole life. When I was growing up, I always thought of having a great watch as that next step - of making it, of a rite of passage.
- When I was younger - up until I was 19 years old and in college - I was surrounded with people in high school who felt like they knew what they wanted to do with their lives, and that was intimidating to me because I didn't.
- 'The Notebook' made me cry! It got me.
- If you're an attractive guy, everyone thinks you're successful just because of the way you look. I hate that.
- Everyone can have their heart broken. Even if you know the relationship isn't working, it's still sad. Even in a bad relationship, they're part of your life for a long time, and saying goodbye to that can be difficult.
