I started asking research questions incessantly. I was drawn very quickly to biology.''' ,'''I had five years of failure, really, before I had the first initial sign of success.''' ,'''One of the major lessons in all of biochemistry, cell biology and molecular medicine is that when proteins operate at the sub cellular level, they behave in a certain way as if they're mechanical machinery.''' ,'''I became aware of the very complex internal organization in a cell from the basic science classes, and it made me think about how all that could work.
