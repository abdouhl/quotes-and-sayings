- I think I've done two shoots in my underwear ever. They both happened to be for Calvin Klein. But that tag - 'underwear model' - I just can't get rid of it. And it's such a bizarre, specific thing - underwear. It's like I never modelled clothes.

- When I think of sex symbols, I think of posters my two sisters had on their bedroom walls.
- Addiction is a terrible thing.
- I'd been auditioning for parts for years. I never got any better at it. I'm crap at auditions. I know there are people who can walk into those rooms and make those lines sing on the page and get the job immediately. I wasn't one of them. I'm still not one of them.
- I don't really have choices in the material I get. So I have to make the choices in the way I play the characters.
- I like playing characters who are fractured, broken. I find that more relatable, for some reason. I don't feel that I'm like that myself by nature, but there's just something that you can really grab hold of if people have a darkness in them, I think.

- Every role is physical to a certain extent, but as a viewer, I don't respond well to actors doing more than they need to tell a story.
- Throughout Ireland, there's a brilliant community of filmmakers and actors, and I guess there was always a lure to do some work in the place where I come from.

- I feel good that I have my life in order. I'm not addicted to anything that I'm aware of.

- People ask me what Gillian Anderson's like to work with, and I have no idea!
- It's a strange environment, being hounded. The paparazzi are cretins.
- I think when romantic comedies are done well, it's a great genre. 'When Harry Met Sally' is kind of a benchmark for me, but I'm very happy to admit that I love 'Pretty Woman.' I do!

- Nobody sane wants just to be famous.
- My wife is a brilliant, hugely understanding person.

- I'm amazed if people are happy in their own skin.
