- I remember us all playing Trivial Pursuit at home and my granddad was a member of a local quiz leagues. When I was old enough, I joined the Bolton leagues.
- I love having a costume for The Vixen as getting into the look allows me to be a bit more snarky and snippy.
- One person might be able to learn by reading, another will have a good audio memory, and another will make notes in different colored pens. I have a more multi sensory memory - I remember what I was doing when I learnt it and where I was.
- Yeah, I was expecting most of the comments about my appearance to be about me being fat, because I'm not a skinny girl by any means. But I wasn't expecting there to be that sort of wave of 'Wow - the new Chaser's hot!'
- I'd love it if I could face off against the 'Eggheads.'

- I get a lot of people asking if my hair is a wig because it is in an elaborate style. I assure them it is all my own.
