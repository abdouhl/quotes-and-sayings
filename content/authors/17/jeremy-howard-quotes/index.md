- People ask me what it was like working with Jim Carrey. Well, I never really saw too much of him. I would talk to him on the set, but I was looking at a Grinch facade. It was his voice and all, but... Jim is amazing to watch in front of the camera. I learned a lot from him. He was also always very nice and generous to me.
- 'Galaxy Quest' was cool to work on. When I first signed on, I really didn't know anything about it. I read the script, which I though was cool, but it wasn't until I saw the designs for the CG stuff that I knew it was going to be pretty sweet.
- Sigourney Weaver was one of the nicest lady actors I have ever met. So friendly about everything.
- Acting was always something fun to do on the side growing up, but I never really took it seriously. I would do a commercial every few months, and that paid my school tuition. But in high school, I was mostly into sports and didn't go out for stuff during those seasons.
