- I played club football with a traveling team since I was 8 years old. I also played basketball and baseball, so I was competing on the athletic fields the entire year.

- The only job I'd consider leaving ESPN for would be to call NFL games.

- When I became more aware and educated on the state of youth sports and the inability for so many who want to participate, I knew I wanted to be involved.
- I think success breeds success.
- I just love that in college football, we get these big nonconference matches early. It's exciting for everybody. It's exciting for the fans and the players as well.
- The only thing I wanted to do since I was seven was play quarterback in the NFL, but as I grew older, I started to discover other interests.
- I use Instagram the most. I like visual. I like pictures. I've tried to engage fans and let them see parts of my life that they don't see on air. I'm trying to give behind-the-scenes access.
- I never tried to pigeonhole myself. I've been willing to take risks and try doing things like reality TV with 'The Bachelor' or Food Network or 'Good Morning America.'

- But I remember back in 1998, the year after Peyton Manning left Tennessee, a lot of people didn't really give Tennessee a chance. There was a lesser-known Tee Martin playing quarterback. He ended up leading them to a national championship in 1998 the year after Peyton left.
- I've been really, really fortunate, everything from football on has been icing on the cake, so I'm living my dream.

- Ultimately, college football is a huge passion of mine. In my opinion, I really feel ESPN owns college football. The only way I think I could have left ESPN was for an opportunity to call NFL games. That was the opportunity I had at Fox.
