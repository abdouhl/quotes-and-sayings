I've been approached by other companies to do a documentary about cosplay and about my life, but I've never felt comfortable.''' ,'''For people who have been following me for a long time, I really hope that they can get to know me a little better, maybe get to know the softer, squishy, emotional side of me, because I usually put up a weird side, so it'll be cool to be able to open up in that way to them.''' ,]
