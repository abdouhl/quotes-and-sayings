- I actually don't watch TV at all. If you asked me what my favorite TV show is, I couldn't tell you because I don't watch TV.
- I don't consider myself a star or a celebrity or anybody, you know. I just think of myself as doing something that I love to do.
- It was a lot of fun working with J.J. Abrams. He got me to drive a Corvette, which was pretty awesome, and jumping out of it was even cooler.
- I work mostly during the week, and on the weekend I get to hang out with friends, so it balances out pretty well.
- I'd like to tour all over the world. I'd like to be everywhere. I've really wanted to tour out of the country. I think that would be really cool.
- When I want to put out an album, I want to write it. I want to be able to say that I wrote my album, and all this stuff is from me.
- Hopefully, I can follow in Leonardo DiCaprio's shoes. I probably say this in every interview, but he is one of my favorite actors of all time.
