- I've grown up making the best out of what I've got.
- Music videos are like tools that young artists use to earn respect from their peers, to 'represent.'
- I'm all right if the NHS gets privatized. I'll just spit two bars, get a bit of money and go fix my ribs.
- We lived together until Skepta was 30-something. We've been together so long, it's impossible for us to have any differences, no matter how long we're apart.
- Graffiti is art, but you don't see graffiti in the National Gallery. Graffiti is on the street - that's where it belongs.
- A lot of young artists think that by looking tough in a homemade video they're worth something. In time they'll realize getting respected for your talent is what counts.
- When I'm making music... or writing a bar... I'm not thinking, 'Ah, I can't wait to put this on Spotify! I can't wait to put this on Apple Music!' I don't make music for that. I make music so I can see it - I need to see the reaction. I need to feel it.
- 'New Slaves' is too real to me. It's like a freestyle of real talk, with the sickest beat. It's like the beat was made for the verses themselves.
- When you grow up in a council flat, sometimes living on top of members of your crew, the feeling of community is intense.
- MCs want to represent how it is on their streets. But many of the younger ones are closed-minded: they think about the image more than the music. But as they grow older they realize the music matters more than their image.

- Sometimes I feel like we don't need to vote - like it doesn't matter.
- We're a really close family, we've only ever been in three-bedroom houses, so we were always sharing bedrooms, two of us, or three of us at times.
- My dad used to DJ too, so we used to hear music all the time.
- Everyone feels like there's something you should do: you should make a song, do a YouTube video, get your views, put it on Spotify, tweet it, Instagram it, do it again and again and again. And I think, that's not what I'm living for. I ain't living for that.
- I didn't understand how to make it in the music industry, I just wanted to make music.
- The fabric of our community, our culture, is MCing.
- My dad had records, but only one deck, so Skep used to try and play a song on one deck - the Music Centre we used to call it, a cabinet with a glass door - he would play one tune on the record and then mix the tape to it, that's what he used to like doing. He became a DJ.
