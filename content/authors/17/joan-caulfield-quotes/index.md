quotes = ['''I'm not wholesome at all. I detest homey things like cooking and bed-making and Peter Pan collars. I like to wear slacks and play golf.''' ,'''Few people realize what a handicap it is to be what people call a beautiful woman. I'm glad, of course, that I don't look like an unmade bed, but too often, I'm just taken at face value. And there aren't many men who believe a beautiful woman can have any brains.''' ,'''I guess I'm just not the film femme fatale type. I giggle too much.
