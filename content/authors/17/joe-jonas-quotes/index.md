- I was going to make movies. I was the one in the family who was always rolling the video camera, making movies of my brothers around town, and then screening them for my parents.

- I'm a big fan of certain new acts. I love any genre of music, and I think it's really great to see that there are new artists coming through. It's kinda funny to think that I'm like the old man on campus now. But I'm really happy for groups like One Direction. I think they're really good guys.
- I love making Italian food. And coconut chicken.
- The first CD that I ever bought was 'Britney Spears.' It was at a 7-Eleven and I was like, 'Can I get this?' It was literally her EP and I picked it up and, of course, I fell in love with her. It was an early crush for me.
- I warm up. I do about 50 push-ups with my trainer and my security just to get pumped up before a show, get our energy up. And then I just go have fun.

And I've been writing a lot of music, so hopefully very soon I'll have recorded a project of my own. I also want to get a boat and open a restaurant.
- A lot of people look back ten years ago and go, 'Why was I wearing that?' I look back a year ago and say the same thing. The craziest outfit I ever wore was this white suit that I wore to an awards show in L.A. that I teamed with yellow shoes. It was interesting. It popped.
- I feel like every artist has an opportunity to create something new and to challenge themselves to reach out to a new crowd.
