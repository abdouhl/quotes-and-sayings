I have never felt that way. All you have is language. Why write beneath yourself? It's an act of respect for the reader as much as yourself.''' ,'''I feel that I'll be buried in Ireland and don't think I'll ever live in the U.S. I'm not comfortable with many aspects of U.S. society - especially the justice system.''' ,'''I think people are confusing the right to write with the right to be published.''' ,'''There is a very conservative element of crime writers that don't recognise what I do is crime fiction.''' ,'''I've been fascinated by the idea that evil is the absence of empathy.''' ,'''Writers are magpies by nature, always collecting shiny things, storing them away and looking for connections of things.''' ,'''What is good for you creatively is usually bad commercially. You thrive financially by sticking to a series and not fiddling about too much. You do yourself harm by moving away from the series and the genre. By trying things not based in that particular mode of writing, you will just lose readers.''' ,]
