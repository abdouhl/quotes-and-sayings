I wore thick glasses. I had acne.''' ,'''This is the essence of the American Dream - in the land of opportunity, if you have a good idea, create a solid plan, and work hard, you should be able to reinvent yourself and get ahead.''' ,'''The most important thing a mayor does is hire talented people to run the city.''' ,'''We need to recognize that we can't allow people that are aberrations of nature to take away the joys and freedoms that we enjoy.''' ,'''I try to go to concerts whenever I can, just because I love music.''' ,'''Slavery is the nagging, unrelenting shame of America that continues to deny the true promise of the country to too many its citizens.

It would depress the product category of soft drinks.''' ,'''People turn off the news, stop reading in-depth magazine articles - especially young people. Look at the increasing reluctance of young people to vote. I think a lot of that is directly - you can lay it at the feet of these negative campaigns and relentless attack ads.''' ,'''Being the one person out there committed to not running negative ads - voters respond to that.''' ,'''My mother was widowed twice before she turned forty.''' ,'''We did not do a good enough job of taking care of the people who were losing their careers and retraining them into the new economy.''' ,'''If people think that Colorado is a beacon for artists and creative people who are really talented, I think they're going to be a little happier during the day, and I think they're going to be a little more successful at their job, no matter what their job is.''' ,'''Colorado is known for many great things.''' ,'''One's ability to enter into thousands of lawsuits as a tool for success, or to use bankruptcy to avoid paying your former employees and vendors, have little relevance when trying to create good government.''' ,'''Infrastructure is more than laying new roads and expanding transit: it's running the fiber and deploying new technologies for reliable, affordable Internet in every part of the state.''' ,'''Partisanship has gotten worse and worse.''' ,'''On Mother's Day, we take a moment to stop and honor our mothers for all they do. It has been my privilege to know mothers who have turned incredible loss and pain into tremendous advocacy and greater social change.''' ,'''As a businessman, I learned something that Donald Trump never figured out: It isn't about how many times you yell, 'You're fired,' but instead, how many times you say, 'You're hired.'''' ,'''In the restaurant business, you learn quickly there's no margin in having enemies.''' ,'''When I got inaugurated in 2010, OneRepublic donated their time and played for the inauguration.

It was awesome.''' ,'''Foreign students... big part of our economy.''' ,'''Democracy is based upon empathy and the recognition that some decisions are solely for the community's benefit without regard to one's own narrow self-interest.''' ,'''If I can convince people that good people don't do attack ads, and that we want good people to represent us, then the attack ads work against themselves.''' ,'''Especially during the first nine months, there was so much going on with trying to hire 55 people to run the city, it was hard to imagine any honeymoon.''' ,'''I've made several careers out of people underestimating me - it's almost an advantage worth cultivating.''' ,'''A mayor is a symbol and a public face of what a city bureaucracy provides its citizens.''' ,'''I would argue that one of the issues which the public should be much more emphatic about with all politicians... is patronage, appointing people to high positions because they supported your campaign or helped you raise money.''' ,'''The world has become rapidly more competitive.''' ,'''We are, by many measures, one of the more diverse cities in the country, growing more diverse all the time, and one of the more harmonious in terms of how we live together.''' ,'''If it was really successful, it was a life calling, a career I was excited about doing, so I didn't think the overall risk was anywhere near as high as what the reward was.''' ,'''Denver is a city that will be far more defined by its future than its past.''' ,'''Wellington Webb was one of the most significant mayors of the latter half of the 20th century. His natural political instincts are almost unrivaled.''' ,'''When I opened my first brew-pub, I did not include a checkbox on hiring applications that required applicants to disclose criminal convictions. And we were better for it.''' ,'''I'm not sure there's another way to help move more people out of poverty than to raise the minimum wage.''' ,'''I used to make snap judgments, moved quickly.

I lost not only my job, but also my profession.''' ,'''Colorado has always been a good place to find what you're made of.''' ,'''I loved baseball. I was a pitcher. I loved being on the mound because I also loved being at the center of the action, the cat and mouse battle with the batter on every pitch.

When that happens, we will address it honestly and openly and try to deal with it as quickly and as fairly as we can, and keep moving the city forward.''' ,'''Secure the border; have an ID system that works.

Every time we get in our car? Yeah. Are we materially less safe now than we were 10 years ago?

Each time, mom would gently roll him over, replace the sheets, and roll him back - then spend the whole next day washing several sets of sheets, only to repeat the routine each night.''' ,'''I never ran for student council or class president or any of that stuff.
