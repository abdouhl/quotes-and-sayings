- Really and truly, everyone just wants to be paid for what they've done, so they can continue to do it, and see your work in the highest production quality. TV offers that.
- If you look at the statistics, I genuinely understand why when we go to a production company or a broadcaster, and they say our show is niche and it's not going to reach a wide enough audience. The bottom line is the majority TV audience is aged 40 to 65.
- The first comic I read was a Spider-Man comic, and my introduction to it was through my family. My cousins are a lot older than me, and they've been huge comic book fans, from the jump.
- I see 'Cyborg' as probably the most iconic African American superhero within all of the comic worlds.
- If I'm doing press, I usually try and train in the mornings. I find if I don't, and I leave it, I get tired throughout the day.
- By the time I was 20 I wanted to be in my first Hollywood blockbuster. Achieving that by 24 is amazing, by God's grace - but you're running on a ticking time bomb.
- The biggest thing is being a man of your own time, combining craft with the graft, creating your own opportunities.
- I love 'Doctor Who', it's wicked.
- To be honest, there is no appeal in TV, other than the fact you can fund your project.
- You either sit there and take the roles that you don't want to do, and forever - I didn't pick this career to be unhappy.
- The heroes that have everything together, they aren't very interesting at all.
- I'm a huge comic book fan and fanatic, and so are my cousins.
- I've always wanted to play a superhero. It was just about figuring out which one I could actually play.
- I want to play a character which is as far away from myself as possible and a character that isn't even human, a superhero is just that.
- I train five times a week, usually three-four times with my personal trainer.
- When I grew up my role model was Will Smith. I wanted to have my own TV show, do films where I can do comedy and big films such as 'I Am Legend'.
- No carbs when I'm not working, so on Saturday and Sunday I don't eat any carbs 'cos I'm not burning any, I'm not working out. A high intake of fibre and salads to stay lean.
- I think seeing someone go from a YouTube series to a Hollywood film spurs people on.
- I love acting, I love directing, I love writing, I love producing, I love creating.
- I bumped into Mike Epps in a barber shop. I was in the Warner Brothers studios trying to find my way for an audition and director Jordan Peele was just standing talking in a corner, so I had to introduce myself.
- My usual will be eating five boiled eggs, go into the gym, then eat my oatmeal, then get cracking with whatever press I have. I try to meal prep or get a meal prep company or buy a certain amount of meals throughout that day while I'm travelling.
