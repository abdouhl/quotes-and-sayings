- I think most actors will say they always feel like they'll never work again.
- Just because you're laughing, it doesn't mean the audience will, necessarily.

- In this business, you have so little control over things, but one of the things you can control is who you work with.
- I feel very, very lucky to have been involved with a project that's gone on as long as 'The Closer' has. You really don't get to do that in this profession.

- Ten years of character development affords you a lot. You get a chance to dig deeper and deeper and deeper into a person.
- Whenever you're working on a film or TV set, the hours are very, very long.
- When you get together with childhood friends, for example, there's an intimacy that you instantly have because you share something really profound in your past. There's a shortcut to emotional intimacy if you share your past with somebody. It's really empowering when you're reunited with people who share that.
- That's something that's really rare and special and what any actor would love - to have somebody that's specifically writing for you.
- I experience a high on stage that I get nowhere else. I feel its like going to the gym so I won't lose my skills.
- I was close with some of my old professors.
- In between jobs, you think your luck has run out, but they keep on letting me do what I love to do. I really can't complain.
