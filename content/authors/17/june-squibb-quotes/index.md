- I am an avid reader.
- New York, oh my God, in my early 20s. I felt, this is home, this is really where I belong.
- I always made a decent living.
- The thing I always thought of myself as was an actress. I never thought: 'I want to be.' It was always: 'I am.'
- I loved New York. I made enough money and studied acting with Kenneth McMillan, which was my first formal training.
- To make money in New York, you have to add gigs when starting out, so while I was acting quite a bit, I would do modeling.
- My whole thing is, I collect what I know I want to read, and I have certain bookshelves in my bedroom that contain all the books I haven't read yet.
- I had three influential teachers. The first was Uta Hagen. The second two, Bobby Lewis and my late husband, Charles Kakatsakis, were both from the Actors Studio.
- I've been involved in all the different awards shows. Apparently, what I wear becomes important.
- I was born and grew up in Vandalia, Illinois, a small town of about 6,000. It was farm country, and this was the little county seat.
