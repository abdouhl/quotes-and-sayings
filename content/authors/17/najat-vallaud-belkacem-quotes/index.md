- Some Muslim students experience secularism as an act of aggression.
- We have to reappropriate the concept of laicite (secularism) so we can explain to our young pupils that whatever their faith, they belong to this idea, and they're not excluded. Secularism is not something against them; it protects them.
- It's important to understand that one gender is not superior to the other.

- Compared to some of our neighbours, it's not frowned upon to be a mother and work in France.
- I feel totally French - I don't feel half-French because of my dual nationality. For me, dual nationality just means I don't deny my roots.
- By continuing to increase teacher recruitment and training - and ameliorating wages and working conditions - we will be able to shore up the weaknesses of the French education system.

- I molded myself against le Front National. Against hate speech, be it racist, sexist, xenophobic, or homophobic. Against the kind of injustice I faced during my own life.
- I have a chart for success at school because it gave me a great deal of pleasure. It opened my mind to the world. I learned to read.
- You should be appeasing people as much as possible, not stigmatising them. The ban of the burkini puts into question people's individual freedoms.
- Equality in education is my number one battle.
- Low income persons in need of social housing should be housed in more prosperous areas to avoid placing an extra burden on the poorer areas and to redress the balance in terms of housing, redressing the balance in terms of schooling.
- If you're asking me in a general context whether I'm for or against the burkini, the response is simple: I oppose the burkini.

- The proliferation of bans fuels stereotypes and discriminates against a community.
- School is at once a place of hope, but it's also a laboratory that exposes our differences.
- The education ministry files suit every time there is a case of identity fraud.
- It is not just family that must transmit values, but school also.
- When I started out, it was rare to see elected representatives with foreign roots. Often, I was relegated to my origins, put in the diversity box: 'You're the new face of diversity.' That annoyed me because I always felt French, and suddenly I was being made to feel I wan't as French as others.
- Inequality of women concerns both India and France, though it might have different manifestations in both the countries.
- When I look back at where I came from, at the school I attended... my classmates for the most part haven't had successful paths - many have had a difficult, chaotic path.

- I'm aware that beyond my own need to find a personal balance, I should be sending a signal to society as women's minister about the importance of work-life balance.
- Teachers alone can't educate young people.
- I was very shy and reserved, so it was a bit contradictory to get into politics.
- Our universities also have a lot of foreign students. Are we going to ban them access because in their culture there's a certain type of clothing?
- We know that if religion is allowed into schools, pupils will sometimes begin to question the teaching they receive.

- There is no link between the terror attacks of Daesh and the dress of a woman on the beach.
- The fact of leaving one's country, one's family, one's roots, can be painful. My father had already found his place, but for us, for my mother, it was very difficult to get our bearings.
- School was always a major player in my personal journey. It allowed me to open up to the world, and also social mobility. It allowed me to enrich myself, to read, learn and understand.

- Do we have to give Mr Sarkozy a history lesson? Yes, there are Gauls among our ancestors. But there are also Romans, Normans, Celts, Nicois, Corsicans, Arabs, Italians, Spanish. That's France.
- Is it written that equality between men and women means one can change sex? Obviously not.
- If a big number of young pupils felt secularism was an attack on them, it was because the term had been misused and deformed in the public debate for years by the extreme-right and the right as an attack on Islam. The term had often been misused to point out how Muslims were different to others, and that is clearly problematic.
- Preventing children from going to school, and preventing teachers from doing their jobs, seems to be not just undemocratic but intolerable.
- As long as there is no proselytism... we must facilitate the partnership between parents and schools.

- How can a child adhere to school and the notion of secularism when they see their mother rejected from a school outing, stigmatized, left on the sidelines, just because she has a scarf on her head?
- We have several million Muslims in France who are mostly moderates or non-practicing. If they feel that it is the only subject in public debate, they won't feel at home and will be tempted to withdraw to their communities.
