- I was a huge fan of 'Game Of Thrones.' I hadn't read the books but had watched the series from the beginning.
- I didn't go to drama school, so I feel like I did all my growing up on 'Hollyoaks.'
- I have been challenged with the fictional languages I have to learn. I wasn't terrible at languages at school - I got an A in French, so I did well enough - but I didn't enjoy them. I'm not even sure if that plays into how well you learn a fictional language!
- With 'Game of Thrones,' there are no real limitations.
- I would love to do more work in the States, but I like working at home in the U.K., so to work here and there would be the plan.
- I'm a bit of a 'Throny,' as I think the 'Game of Thrones' fans refer to themselves.
