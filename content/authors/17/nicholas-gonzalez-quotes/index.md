I think, for any sort of relationship, there has to be levels of that.''' ,'''It's a bit disturbing to me that people have to evolve to the idea that people are equal.''' ,'''My father's a dermatologic surgeon; my brother's a surgeon.''' ,'''You can ask any Latin actor: inevitably, if they get a part meant for a white guy, producers will change the character's name to sound more Latin.''' ,'''We fight the stereotypes, but in fighting them, we show them.

It's no longer based on a headshot. I realize now what they're buying is passion.''' ,'''If it hadn't been for Senator Sanders, I don't know if I would've been brought back into the fold of politics.''' ,'''Just because we finally have a Latino family on TV doesn't mean we're up there to lecture people about what it means to be Latino.''' ,'''It's so much more interesting having life under your belt.''' ,'''Bernie Sanders supports offering a pathway to citizenship for immigrants already in the U.S. and halting deportations for almost 9 million hardworking undocumented fathers and mothers.''' ,'''I no longer take on everything offered.

They don't treat it as something that's an unattainable, weird thing that they have to aspire to and reach for in a scene.''' ,'''Until a legislative solution to the nation's outdated immigration system becomes a priority for Congress, the right administration will need to examine a broad range of executive actions to enact immediately in the face of a 'Do Nothing Congress.'''' ,'''I worked with Devin Kelley on 'Resurrection,' and Mekhi Phifer has been a long time buddy.''' ,'''I've been fortunate that a lot of roles I've done have been professionals and not your TV stereotype of Latinos.''' ,]
