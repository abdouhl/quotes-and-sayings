quotes = ['''I'm not going to pretend to be anything I'm not.''' ,'''It's not an idle boast that the British Army is, man for man, probably the best fighting force in the world.''' ,'''To be dubbed by my sovereign is an absolutely wonderful honour for me and my family.''' ,'''I accept that the Army must do what it thinks it needs to get people to join, but I think they ought to be extremely cautious about the message they send outside.''' ,'''This country has always led from the front and it should continue to do so.''' ,'''I never thought I would hear Labour and Scottish Nationalist ministers in both Westminster and Holyrood publicly recognise the environmental benefits of good grouse moor management.''' ,'''I think to leave Europe would be a threat on the one hand to our economic security and on the other our national security.''' ,'''Churchill's career was littered with oratorical disasters when he misjudged the audience.''' ,'''I know, as a former serving officer, that our troops are extremely well disciplined and well led, and they take the correct treatment of prisoners very seriously.''' ,'''I think one of the laughable things about poor old Brexit is that they're so cross - they're furious with everyone. But this isn't a cross country; this is a generous and optimistic country.''' ,'''Unlike his father, Churchill was not a natural speaker.''' ,'''I'm very lucky in my constituency. I have very grown up sensible members who don't agree with me, but we never have a quarrel. I absolutely respect their views.''' ,'''As millions of people know, one of the great pleasures of walking in areas of the uplands managed for grouse is to see and hear large numbers of curlew, lapwing and golden plover - all ground-nesting birds largely absent or in rapidly declining numbers elsewhere.''' ,'''It is one thing to go into combat, but quite another to go in with the sapping knowledge that what you do in the next few chaotic minutes or hours in the name of your mates, your regiment, your country, might also see you dragged into court.''' ,'''The whole social media can destroy people overnight.''' ,'''I'm quite sure that, had Twitter been of an age when my grandfather was prime minister, I'm sure they would have used it. He was a brilliant and gifted communicator.''' ,'''When you have a general election result you don't like, you don't have another general election.''' ,'''Boris Johnson is nothing like Winston Churchill.''' ,'''Game-keepers on grouse moors control common predators such as foxes and crows and this gives wading birds a much greater chance of breeding successfully.''' ,'''My job is to be an MP. It's not just about Europe.''' ,'''I'm not optimistic for my country. I don't see how we're ever going to project our influence and our standing and our power outside the E.U. Britain's voice is going to diminish, I'm afraid.''' ,'''I think Churchill would have thought it extraordinary that we would have thought ourselves so successful, so powerful, so well thought of in the world that we could afford to give up this extraordinary relationship we have in this great European Union.''' ,'''Our freedom, our prosperity and our security depend on a proper respect for the fortune of our neighbours, allies and old friends.''' ,'''If you ask a soldier what is the key to this confidence, they will likely answer their discipline and their training.''' ,'''The idea that the British carried out hundreds of war crimes in Iraq is, of course, utterly without foundation and grossly unfair.''' ,'''I bridled strongly when Labour introduced their Right to Roam, fearing that it would be misused by the hard Left to stir up unnecessary trouble in the countryside. In fact, greater access to the uplands has been a very good thing.''' ,'''My family have a long story of service to our country.''' ,'''To work for the good of our country is not a shallow thing.''' ,'''I really should not need to spell this out, but one of the attributes of a successful sniper is that he makes no sound at all - nor, indeed, shouts out warnings!''' ,'''I am worried about the Tory party because give or take the odd spasm we have always been seen as pragmatic, sensible, good at our job, sane, reasonable and having the interests of the whole country. Now it is beginning to look like a Brexit sect.''' ,'''The eurosceptics, many of whom are my friends and are highly intelligent people with strong views, they are entirely respectable in every way, I just don't agree with them.''' ,'''I hope that 'Remain' will carry the day, just on the grounds of common sense.''' ,'''As Churchill's grandson, I am in daily receipt of vile correspondence from people telling me that I am a traitor to his memory.''' ,'''Winston Churchill was like Winston Churchill because of his experiences in life.''' ,'''Schengen cannot survive without the most dramatic reform, and the external borders of Europe must be rapidly strengthened.''' ,'''It is often quite impossible to gauge the mood of the Chamber in advance, particularly on big occasions. One moment, it is relaxed and good-humoured; at the next, it can be angry and querulous, and the House in this mood can be a formidable arena.''' ,'''The comparison between Harry Cohen and my grandfather is not one that bears close examination.''' ,'''As all Members of Parliament know, the ease and flow of making a speech outside the House is not at all the same as that required in the Chamber.''' ,'''To engage all sides of Parliament in a common national cause is not unpatriotic.''' ,'''I think this country is genuinely a meritocracy.''' ,'''Boris Johnson's experience in life is telling a lot of porkies about the European Union in Brussels and then becoming prime minister.''' ,'''As the world has grown bigger for our country, the opportunities greater, the chances more glittering for our commerce and our people, too many of those who practice politics have taken a cramped and limited view of Europe and the rest of the world.''' ,'''When you are choosing an MP you need to choose the person who is pretty much likely to be the best representative for your area.''' ,'''One hopes that good, sensible and brave people will continue to go into public life at all levels.''' ,'''We must find a credible route through Brexit to build a better country and go forward together.''' ,]
