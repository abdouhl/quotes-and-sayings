I grew up in an area where it is a war zone - south London.''' ,'''Two things revolutionised life: moving to the countryside and falling in love.''' ,'''There is no hiding the fact I'm an avid Millwall fan.''' ,'''In my real life I live in the countryside, I walk a lot, I shoot clay pigeons, I don't get involved in the film business or anything, and then in my cinematic life, I think I am drawn to the dark side.''' ,'''I've got a reputation for doing a certain type of film: lads' movies that glamorise violence. The more my reputation as a bad boy grows, the more my life moves away from that.''' ,'''My mum is incredibly leftwing, and my dad was quite rightwing - no surprise they didn't stay together - and so I had two very conflicting political opinions as a child, neither of which I was interested in taking any notice of, being a sort of little reprobate.''' ,'''I don't want to die with regrets. I like living and experiencing and feeling the whole lot.''' ,'''I do show violence as entertainment. Clearly, I'd be a liar if I said I didn't.''' ,'''I'm not making films for critics, I'm making films for people to go out and enjoy.''' ,'''I understand working-class culture, tribalism and the ethos of violence, so I make films about these things.''' ,'''This sounds really hokey, but I think Buddhism is the only religion that is genuinely peaceful, so I'd try to promote it in a contemporary society.''' ,]
