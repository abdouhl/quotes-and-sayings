And as one Nation under God, we know that many times our most powerful tool is prayer.''' ,'''Today we thank God for all the blessings He has bestowed upon this great Country and ask Him to continue to heal our land and meet our needs - and we do so through the power of prayer.''' ,'''Peace cannot come from punishing the Palestinian people.''' ,'''Over the last six years, airlines have experienced severe financial pressure to leave smaller communities, making demands on the EAS program even greater.''' ,'''Reasonable, even intelligent people can, and frequently do, disagree on how best to achieve peace in the Middle East, but, peace must be the goal of our foreign policy tools, whether they be by the stick or by the carrot.''' ,'''Madam Speaker, I have spent more than half my life as a member of the Resources Committee. In that time I have supported numerous wilderness designations. In fact, I cannot recall ever opposing a wilderness bill.''' ,'''Today, our actions must be motivated only by our intense desire to achieve a just and lasting peace. The compassion and charity of the American people should be reflected in this legislation, though sadly, they are silenced.''' ,'''But through world wars and a Great Depression, through painful social upheaval and a Cold War, and now through the attacks of September 11, 2001, our Nation has indeed survived.''' ,]
