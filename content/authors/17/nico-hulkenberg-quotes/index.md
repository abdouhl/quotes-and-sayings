quotes = ['''It is obviously always nice to start in a strong way, but it's also very important to keep that strength during the year - the season is quite long, from March to November.''' ,'''When I was 7-years-old I, discovered Go-Karts and started Karting, since then I thought to be an F1 driver, that was pretty much buried into my head.''' ,'''I don't have a sponsor or come from an exotic country where I can bring tonnes of money.''' ,'''Of course it's a nice challenge to compete against a grand prix winner.''' ,'''My first pole position is an emotional and hopefully historic moment as I want to be in F1 for many, many years.''' ,'''I've always enjoyed visiting India and we usually go to Mumbai or Delhi a few times during the season.

I would very much like to be 10cm shorter and 10kgs lighter. It would make my life a lot easier but it is what it is. What can I do?''' ,'''Renault has always been a big player in the motorsport world that brings up incredible memories.''' ,'''You don't get that opportunity everyday to do Le Mans with Porsche, a brand that has so much tradition and history.
