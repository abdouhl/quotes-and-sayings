- When you do 'Mad Fat Diary' or 'The Village,' you always learn about the particular time period, and that's always nice for an actor.
- 'Hollyoaks' is where I learnt a lot of the craft, being in front of a camera six days a week. That's certainly an experience you don't get in drama school. It invites you to be comfortable in front of the camera.
- I love film, and I think it's so important for kids to be educated about films and real life subjects that films cover.
- Personally, I don't know what I'd do without films.
- When I was six, I entered a talent contest. I dyed my hair blond, had a chainsaw and pretended I was Eminem. The old folk weren't expecting that.
- I'm definitely a morning person. I wake up dead happy, looking forward to having my cereal!
- My dad lives in Sicily, so I'm half Italian and half Irish - it's a fiery combination.
- I've really enjoyed my three years at 'Hollyoaks.' I worked with the most amazing people.
