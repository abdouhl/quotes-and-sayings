quotes = ['''We need a President who is intellectual, who is a brilliant thinker, and not only that, someone who has a heart for the people and who can represent Singapore on the greater world stage.''' ,'''I was drawn to the ethos of WP, which believes in building a strong and reasonable opposition that contributes to our political landscape in Singapore in a constructive manner. It's a party that does not oppose for the sake of opposing.''' ,'''If you think I'm just another pretty face, read my Facebook updates, read my articles, read the interviews I've done and judge for yourself.''' ,'''I was a mediocre B-average student throughout my school years.''' ,'''A lot of people have the expectation that politicians shouldn't just disappear into the woodwork even if they didn't win the election.''' ,'''For me, any chance to serve Singapore even in its limited capacity... I would be glad to take it up and use it to serve Singaporeans.''' ,'''I know now that much of the pressure that resulted in my breakdown was self-imposed. I didn't let myself enjoy the opportunities I was given, choosing instead to doubt myself.''' ,'''Technically I don't play sports because I have two left feet and I cannot coordinate and my motor skills are a bit 'out of whack.'''' ,'''Politics wasn't actively discussed in my household. I only knew that my parents had always supported the opposition.''' ,'''I think community service on its own is very simple, it's a lot less complicated than having a political affiliation to it, which I fully understand.''' ,'''I still feel very uncomfortable with the term 'celebrity' because I don't see myself as one.''' ,'''I tend to do things without my parents' permission.''' ,'''I just like to eat, buy food, eat food. Eating is my hobby.''' ,'''What I appreciate about WP is that they have very clear processes for candidacy and membership. There is no fast track or parachuting.''' ,'''The president needs to be a figure that unites Singaporeans. In order to do that, he needs to be someone who not only understands the viewpoints held by the establishment, but those held by the other more divergent sectors of society.''' ,'''Looks are just something on the surface. I think the electorate is more discerning than that. They want to know your stand on policies.''' ,'''Having strangers bash you is something you never get used to.''' ,'''I understand how it feels to stand in a crowded train, to be stuck in congested traffic.''' ,'''I hope that people who might speak out respectfully and out of concern would not get mobbed or bullied for their differing views.''' ,'''I just want to say that I want to endorse Tan Jee Say for President because I think he really has what it takes.''' ,'''There are patches in the GRC that are actually full of low-income people... and we cannot leave them behind in our pursuit of economic development and success.''' ,'''If I want to be brave enough to stand up and make my opinions count, I will have to take the punches and roll with it.''' ,'''When you are in the public eye, in the name of public service, you have to understand that the more people know about you, and the more people say they want to support you, the more you have to work even harder to uphold that trust.''' ,'''I think if you want to go into politics, you have to take a very long-term view with regards to what you want to achieve. You can't make changes in just a short time.''' ,'''What's wrong with Singapore is the idea that things need to be done in a certain way or not at all. Black or white. No room for alternative discussion.''' ,'''In Parliament, you need to ensure that there is a diverse and well-rounded group of individuals who are coming together to speak on behalf of national interests. I want to represent the voices of young Singaporeans who feel that they want a stake in this country, who want to have their voice heard.''' ,'''I try to have lunch or dinner with my parents on the weekends.''' ,'''I started in politics as a fresh graduate wanting to make a difference, by bringing more political awareness and interest to young people.''' ,'''I like someone who can make me laugh and can make me feel secure.''' ,'''Politics is not about a certain type or breed of people. It is a representation of the different voices we have in society.''' ,'''I think that is what the electorate is looking for - they are not looking for a pretty face to lead the country. They are looking for someone who can give them hope, who can promise them change and who can tell them this is your hands and you have the ownership of how you want to steer the country forward.''' ,'''I think if you want to engage in social media, you must take the good with the bad.''' ,'''I feel that I'm an average Singaporean.''' ,'''In a democracy, you have the right to say what you want, but don't forget about equality: are you putting someone else down by saying it?''' ,]
