- Every comedian wants to play the London Comedy Store, and I was no exception.
- I loved Jackie Chan growing up, watching mostly his Hong Kong film work.
- To us in Asia, rice is such a staple, we take it for granted. I didn't even think about how I made it until I came to the Western world.
- Comedy clubs sharpen a comic, they're like the gym for us, making us stronger, faster, funnier. Without them every comedy show would feel like a monologue.
- I tried perming my hair by myself in lockdown. It came out looking ridiculous - my hair was so damaged and crispy.
- I'll be a janitor in 'Crazy Rich Asians 2.' Let's do that.
- I wanted to do comedy because I left Malaysia and went to America. I got bitten by the Western, idealist, opinionated, democracy bug.
- I wasn't raised in a very Western environment. I went to a Chinese-speaking school. In my group of friends, the goal was to be a white-collar worker: an engineer, lawyer, accountant.
- As comedians, we work our whole lives hoping for a break.
