With me, I have the sense that nothing is going to be that bad.''' ,''''Statistically, people who have been happily married and then widowed tend to remarry.''' ,'''But if you know that something has been really vicious, you don't read it, you don't let it into your head. What's damaging is when sentences go through your head and you burn with the injustice of it.''' ,'''I know the crew so well, so I forget I'm being filmed. It's like cooking with a friend in the kitchen - you're talking, as you do, and maybe you're telling her about this wonderful way to prepare lamb chops - it's more natural, more honest.''' ,'''I never have plans for the future as you never know how things will turn out.''' ,'''You don't go around grieving all the time, but the grief is still there and always will be.''' ,'''I can understand why those primitive desert people think a camera steals their soul. It is unnatural to see yourself from the outside.''' ,'''I don't like conflict.''' ,'''In England and America people tend to graze all day long, but I think it's such a waste to be constantly picking at food because you then can't enjoy a proper full meal when the time comes.''' ,'''There is a vast difference between how things seem from the outside and how they feel on the inside.''' ,'''Then again, they're not scripted and I feel it's virtually impossible to be anything but yourself when you're in front of the cameras and cooking so there is a measure of truth in what you see.''' ,'''I never taste the wine first in restaurants, I just ask the waiter to pour.''' ,'''I am not sure about facelifts because I wouldn't want to be someone who just looks like she's had a facelift.''' ,'''Emotion is messy, contradictory... and true.''' ,]
