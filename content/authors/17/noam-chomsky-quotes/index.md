quotes = ['''Real popular culture is folk art - coalminers' songs and so forth.''' ,'''The money in politics is a cash cow for the media.''' ,'''The principle that human nature, in its psychological aspects, is nothing more than a product of history and given social relations removes all barriers to coercion and manipulation by the powerful.''' ,'''One of the best predictors of policy around is Thomas Ferguson's investment theory of politics, as he calls it - very outstanding political economist - which essentially - I mean, to say it in a sentence, he describes elections as occasions in which groups of investors coalesce and invest to control the state.''' ,'''If you get to a point where the existing institutions will not bend to the popular will, you have to eliminate the institutions.''' ,'''The close Turkish-Israeli relations go back to the late 1950s - military intelligence, commercial, more recently, tourism and cultural relations.''' ,'''To summarize, draft resistance can make use of the inegalitarian nature of American society as a technique for increasing the cost of American aggression, and it threatens values that are important to those in a decision-making position.''' ,'''If the United States loses the economic weapons of control, it is very much weakened.''' ,'''The Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor led to many very good things. If you follow the trail, it led to kicking Europeans out of Asia - that saved tens of millions of lives in India alone.''' ,'''The 'anti-globalisation movement' is the most significant proponent of globalisation - but in the interests of people, not concentrations of state-private power.''' ,'''There was unprecedented elite condemnation of the plans to invade Iraq. Sensible analysts were able to perceive that the enterprise carried significant risks for U.S. interests, however conceived.''' ,'''In ideal form of social control is an atomised collection of individuals focused on their own narrow concern, lacking the kinds of organisations in which they can gain information, develop and articulate their thoughts, and act constructively to achieve common ends.''' ,'''States are not moral agents.''' ,'''There happen to be a lot of people around who spent an hour on the Internet and think they know a lot of physics, but it doesn't work like that... There's a reason there are graduate schools in these departments.''' ,'''The threat and use of violence is stimulating nuclear proliferation along with jihadi terrorism.''' ,'''Nicaragua dealt with the problem of terrorism in exactly the right way. It followed international law and treaty obligations. It collected evidence, brought the evidence to the highest existing tribunal, the International Court of Justice, and received a verdict - which, of course, the U.S. dismissed with contempt.''' ,'''When secular figures are turned into divinities, they way they are in Peian Yang or Stanford University - that I don't like.''' ,'''A financial institution has the task of taking risks, and if it's a well run institution - say, Goldman Sachs - it tries to cover the potential losses to itself, but only to itself.''' ,'''I have never really thought that the Left was much in 'array' as far as political purposes were concerned.''' ,'''Anarchism means all sort of things to different people, but the traditional anarchists' movements assumed that there'd be a highly organized society, just one organized from below with direct participation and so on.''' ,'''From the late 1940s, into and through the '50s, there developed a complex interaction between federal government, state and local government, real-estate interests, commercial interests and court decisions, which had the effect of undermining the mass transit system across the country.''' ,'''Even the most cynical can hardly be surprised by the antics of Nixon and his accomplices as they are gradually revealed. It matters little, at this point, where the exact truth lies in the maze of perjury, evasion, and of contempt for the normal - hardly inspiring - standards of political conduct.''' ,'''What's important in Libya is, first of all, it has a good deal of oil. A lot of the country is unexplored; there may be a lot more. And it's very high-quality oil, so very valuable.''' ,'''The murder of Lumumba, in which the U.S. was involved, in the Congo destroyed Africa's major hope for development. Congo is now total horror story, for years.''' ,'''I don't like the intellectual label.''' ,'''The process of shaping opinion, attitudes, and perceptions was termed the 'engineering of consent' by one of the founders of the modern public relations industry, Edward Bernays.''' ,'''Education must provide the opportunities for self-fulfillment; it can at best provide a rich and challenging environment for the individual to explore, in his own way.''' ,'''In 1979, Iranians carried out an illegitimate act: They overthrew a tyrant that the United States had imposed and supported, and moved on an independent path, not following U.S. orders.''' ,'''Whatever the reasons may be, I was very much affected by events of the 1930s - the Spanish Civil War, for example, though I was barely literate.''' ,'''If you could take a subway from the suburbs in Boston, where I live, to downtown in 10 minutes, that improves your life over sitting in a traffic jam. People should see that.''' ,'''Government actually grew during the Reagan years.''' ,'''Descriptive grammar is an attempt to give an account of what the current system is for either a society or an individual, whatever you happen to be studying.''' ,'''Clinton himself acted in ways which increased the threat of terror.''' ,'''When a politician uses the word 'folks,' we should brace ourselves for the deceit, or worse, that is coming.''' ,'''The Occupy movement did create spontaneously communities that taught people something: you can be in a supportive community of mutual aid and cooperation and develop your own health system and library and have open space for democratic discussion and participation. Communities like that are really important.''' ,'''To say that the United States has pursued diplomacy with North Korea is a little bit misleading. It did under the Clinton administration, though neither side completely lived up to their obligations. Clinton didn't do what was promised, nor did North Korea, but they were making progress.''' ,'''If you destroyed half the pharmaceutical production in the United States, we'd think it's a pretty serious problem. In fact, we'd probably go to war.''' ,'''There is no body of theory or significant body of relevant information, beyond the comprehension of the layman, which makes policy immune from criticism.''' ,'''If you're working 50 hours a week to try to maintain family income, and your children have the kinds of aspirations that come from being flooded with television from age one, and associations have declined, people end up hopeless, even though they have every option.''' ,'''My proposal happens to be very mainstream.''' ,'''Intellectuals are in a position to expose the lies of governments, to analyze actions according to their causes and motives and often hidden intentions.''' ,'''If you're worried about the deficit, pay attention to the fact that it's almost all attributable to military spending and the totally dysfunctional health program.''' ,'''Some international law specialists compare the invasion of Iraq to the 'crimes against the peace' for which Nazi leaders were indicted at Nuremberg.''' ,'''The people who were honored in the Bible were the false prophets. It was the ones we call the prophets who were jailed and driven into the desert.''' ,'''In 1961, the United States began chemical warfare in Vietnam, South Vietnam, chemical warfare to destroy crops and livestock. That went on for seven years. The level of poison - they used the most extreme carcinogen known: dioxin. And this went on for years.''' ,'''To some degree it matters who's in office, but it matters more how much pressure they're under from the public.''' ,'''In general, I think, U.S. policies remain constant, going back to the Second World War. But the capacity to implement them is declining.''' ,'''The United States was seriously defeated in Iraq by Iraqi nationalism - mostly by nonviolent resistance. The United States could kill the insurgents, but they couldn't deal with half a million people demonstrating in the streets.''' ,'''States are not moral agents, people are, and can impose moral standards on powerful institutions.''' ,'''Humans have certain properties and characteristics which are intrinsic to them, just as every other organism does. That's human nature.''' ,'''After my first year of college, each course I took in every field was so boring that I didn't even go to the classes.''' ,'''Violence can succeed, as Americans know well from the conquest of the national territory. But at terrible cost. It can also provoke violence in response, and often does.''' ,'''The first democratic revolution was England in the 1640s.''' ,'''Romania, which had the worst dictator in Eastern Europe, Ceausescu, he was a darling of the West. The United States and Britain loved him. He was supported until the last minute.''' ,'''Guantanamo is still open, but it's unlikely that serious torture is going on at Guantanamo. There is just too much inspection.''' ,'''My own feeling is that one should refuse to participate in any activity that implements American aggression - thus tax refusal, draft refusal, avoidance of work that can be used by the agencies of militarism and repression, all seem to me essential.''' ,'''The invasion of Iraq, particularly, gave a big shot in the arm to the jihadi extremists.''' ,'''Resistance is feasible even for those who are not heroes by nature, and it is an obligation, I believe, for those who fear the consequences and detest the reality of the attempt to impose American hegemony.''' ,'''The U.S. and its allies will do anything they can to prevent authentic democracy in the Arab world.''' ,'''When Reagan left office, he was the most unpopular living president, apart from Nixon, even below Carter. If you look at his years in office, he was not particularly popular. He was more or less average. He severely harmed the American economy.''' ,'''The government of Israel doesn't like the kinds of things I say, which puts them into the same category as every other government in the world.''' ,'''Terrorists regard themselves as a vanguard. They're trying to mobilize others to their cause. I mean, every specialist on terrorism knows that.''' ,'''It is pretty ironic that the so-called 'least advanced' people are the ones taking the lead in trying to protect all of us, while the richest and most powerful among us are the ones who are trying to drive the society to destruction.''' ,'''The social and physical construction of suburban America really was quite complex. It was a very elaborate system, and clearly a massive social engineering project that has changed U.S. society enormously.''' ,'''There are nuclear-weapons-free zones in several parts of the world already, except that they're not implemented fully, because the U.S. won't allow it.''' ,'''U.S. Government propaganda tries to give the impression that aerial bombardment achieves near-surgical accuracy, so that military targets can be destroyed with minimal effect on civilians. Technical documents give a different picture.''' ,'''One of the problems of organizing in the North, in the rich countries, is that people tend to think - even the activists - that instant gratification is required. You constantly hear: 'Look I went to a demonstration, and we didn't stop the war so what's the use of doing it again?'''' ,'''Reparations - not just aid - should be provided by those responsible for devastating Iraqi civilian society by cruel sanctions and military actions, and - together with other criminal states - for supporting Saddam Hussein through his worst atrocities and beyond. That is the minimum that honesty requires.''' ,'''Spaniards were condemned for appeasing terrorism by voting for withdrawing troops from Iraq in the absence of U.N. authorization - that is, for taking a stand rather like that of 70 percent of Americans, who called for the U.N. to take the leading role in Iraq.''' ,'''Congressional Republicans are dismantling the limited environmental protections initiated by Richard Nixon, who would be something of a dangerous radical in today's political scene.''' ,'''The good news from the U.S. military survey of focus groups is that Iraqis do accept the Nuremberg principles. They understand that sectarian violence and the other postwar horrors are contained within the supreme international crime committed by the invaders.''' ,'''I know some really outstanding Turkish journalists, and have been pleased and honored to be able to join with them a few times in their courageous protests against state terror and repression.''' ,'''My family was mostly unemployed working class.''' ,'''I haven't read Horowitz. I didn't used to read him when he was a Stalinist, and I don't read him today.''' ,'''Well before September 11, it was understood that with modern technology, the rich and powerful will lose their near monopoly of the means of violence and can expect to suffer atrocities on home soil.''' ,'''It's a near miracle that nuclear war has so far been avoided.''' ,'''Thanh Hoa itself is a rich agricultural province. Rice fields, a pattern of many shades of green, stretch far into the distance along the road, which also winds through foothills and the fringes of heavy jungle where tigers are said to roam. The vegetation, wild or cultivated, is lush.''' ,'''Meteorologists are pretty faces reading scripts telling you whether it's going to rain tomorrow.''' ,'''Palestinians have no wealth or power.''' ,'''I am opposed to the accumulation of executive power anywhere.''' ,'''Debt is a social and ideological construct, not a simple economic fact.''' ,'''The term 'globalisation' is conventionally used to refer to the specific form of investor-rights integration designed by wealth and power, for their own interests.''' ,'''Sooner or later, jihadist-style terror and WMD are going to come together and the consequences could be horrendous.''' ,'''In the late 19th century there was a major union organization, Knights of Labor, and also a radical populist movement based on farmers. It's hard to believe, but it was based in Texas, and it was quite radical. They wanted their own banks, their own cooperatives, their own control over sales and commerce.''' ,'''Governments are supposed to lie to their citizens.''' ,'''Either you repeat the same conventional doctrines everybody is saying, or else you say something true, and it will sound like it's from Neptune.''' ,'''Everyone knows that when you look at a television ad, you do not expect to get information. You expect to see delusion and imagery.''' ,'''I have known people who are working class or craftsmen, who happen to be more intellectual than professors.''' ,'''The argument that resistance to the war should remain strictly nonviolent seems to me overwhelming.''' ,'''All through Latin America, there's sharp condemnation of the criminal atrocities of Sept. 11. But it's qualified by the observation that although these are horrible atrocities, they are not unfamiliar.''' ,'''The neo-cons constitute a radical reactionary fringe of the planning spectrum, but the spectrum is narrow.''' ,'''Sometimes I lose my temper.''' ,'''Historical grammar is a study of how, say, modern English developed from Middle English, and how that developed from Early and Old English, and how that developed from Germanic, and that developed from what's called Proto-Indo-European, a source system that nobody speaks, so you have to try to reconstruct it.''' ,'''Death and genitals are things that frighten people, and when people are frightened, they develop means of concealment and aggression. It is common sense.''' ,'''The major advances in speed of communication and ability to interact took place more than a century ago. The shift from sailing ships to telegraph was far more radical than that from telephone to email!''' ,'''People seem to know about May Day everywhere except where it began, here in the United States of America. That's because those in power have done everything they can to erase its real meaning.''' ,'''The intellectual tradition is one of servility to power, and if I didn't betray it I'd be ashamed of myself.''' ,'''When I arrived in Laos and found young Americans living there, out of free choice, I was surprised. After only a week, I began to have a sense of the appeal of the country and its people - along with despair about its future.''' ,'''When Britain and the U.S. invaded Iraq, it was with the reasonable expectation that it was going to increase the threat of terror, as it has.''' ,'''I admire Ralph Nader and Denis Kucinich very much, and insofar as they bring up issues and carry out an educational and organisational function - that's important, and fine, and I support it.''' ,'''Censorship is never over for those who have experienced it. It is a brand on the imagination that affects the individual who has suffered it, forever.''' ,'''The Iranian government is undoubtedly a severe danger to its own population, but not beyond that.''' ,'''In the 1960s, there was a point, 1968, '69, when there was a very strong antiwar movement against the war in Vietnam. But it's worth remembering that the war in Vietnam started - an outright war started in 1962.''' ,'''Israel is following policies which maximise its security threats... policies which choose expansion over security... policies which lead to their moral degradation, their isolation, their delegitimation, as they call it now, and very likely ultimate destruction. That's not impossible.''' ,'''You go back to the 17th century, the commercial and industrial centers of the world were China and India.''' ,'''As a tactic, violence is absurd. No one can compete with the Government in violence, and the resort to violence, which will surely fail, will simply frighten and alienate some who can be reached, and will further encourage the ideologists and administrators of forceful repression.''' ,'''The U.S. is just in a class by itself in military expenses. It basically matches the rest of the world, and it's far more advanced.''' ,'''There are very few people who are going to look into the mirror and say, 'That person I see is a savage monster;' instead, they make up some construction that justifies what they do.''' ,'''There is still much debate about whether torture has been effective in eliciting information - the assumption being, apparently, that if it is effective, then it may be justified.''' ,'''In Kosovo, the U.S. has chosen a course of action that escalates atrocities and violence. It is also a course of action that strikes a blow against the regime of international order, but which offers the weak at least some protection from predatory states.''' ,'''Free institutions certainly exist, but a tradition of passivity and conformism restricts their use - a cynic might say that this is why they continue to exist.''' ,'''Fidel Castro, whatever people may think of him, is a hero in Latin America, primarily because he stood up to the United States.''' ,'''If you are giving a graduate course you don't try to impress the students with oratory, you try to challenge them, get them to question you.''' ,'''Human nature is not totally fixed, but on any realistic scale, evolutionary processes are much too slow to affect it.''' ,'''There are still thousands of people dying every year in Laos, mostly children and farmers, from unexploded anti-personnel ordnance that the U.S. simply saturated much of the land with, especially in the Plain of Jars. There actually is a British engineering team trying to remove some of these things, which are much worse than land mines.''' ,'''In the academic world, most of the work that is done is clerical. A lot of the work done by professors is routine.''' ,'''I don't know if I officially proofread my father's book, but I read it. I did get some conception of grammar in general from that.''' ,'''I don't join the New Atheists. So, for example, I wouldn't have the arrogance to lecture some mother who hopes to see her dying child in Heaven - that's none of my business, ultimately. I won't lecture her on the philosophy of science.''' ,'''Under Clinton, the defiance of world order has become so extreme as to be of concern even to hawkish policy analysts.''' ,'''I hope that a move toward clemency with Judge Afiuni would be a step towards the importance of maintaining a properly functioning justice system.''' ,'''The 14th Amendment was recognized right away to be problematic. The concept of person was both too narrow and too broad, and the courts went to work to overcome both of those flaws.''' ,'''Israel is a pretty crazy state.''' ,'''The events of October 1962 are widely hailed as Kennedy's finest hour.''' ,'''My speculation is that the U.S. does not want to establish the principle that it has to defer to some higher authority before carrying out the use of violence.''' ,'''The 1950s and 1960s had been a period of enormous growth, the highest in American history, maybe in economic history.''' ,'''How people themselves perceive what they are doing is not a question that interests me.''' ,'''Responsibility, I believe, accrues through privilege.''' ,'''Propaganda is to a democracy what the bludgeon is to a totalitarian state.''' ,'''Washington still refuses to provide evidence to support the claims in 1990 that a huge Iraqi military build-up on the Saudi border justified war.''' ,'''Bradley Manning has been imprisoned without charge, under torture, which is what solitary confinement is.''' ,'''The doctrine that everything is fine as long as the population is quiet, that applies in the Middle East, applies in Central America, it applies in the United States.''' ,'''A consistent anarchist must oppose private ownership of the means of production, and the wage-slavery which is a component of this system, as incompatible with the principle that labor must be freely undertaken and under the control of the producer.''' ,'''In a democracy, in a functioning democracy, what would be happening is that popular organizations, unions, political groupings, others would be developing their programs, putting them forth, insisting that their representatives implement those programs.''' ,'''Human language appears to be a unique phenomenon, without significant analogue in the animal world.''' ,'''By 1960, the South Africans knew that they were becoming a pariah state.''' ,'''Armed attack has a definition in international law. It means sudden, overwhelming, instantaneous ongoing attack.''' ,'''Language is a weapon of politicians, but language is a weapon in much of human affairs.''' ,'''The Latin American debt that reached crisis levels from 1982 would have been sharply reduced by return of flight capital - in some cases, overcome, though all figures are dubious for these secret and often illegal operations.''' ,'''I did used to have nightmares about the idea that when I die, there is a spark of consciousness which basically creates the world. 'Is the world going to disappear if this spark of consciousness disappears? And how do I know it won't? How do I know there's anything there except what I'm conscious of?'''' ,'''Civil disobedience is - it's no fun.''' ,'''In 1963, the U.N. Security Council declared a voluntary arms embargo on South Africa. That was extended to a mandatory embargo in 1977. And that was followed by economic sanctions and other measures - sometimes officials, countries, cities, towns - some organized by popular movements.''' ,'''Those who had demanded no more than an end to the bombing of North Vietnam and a commitment to negotiations saw their demands being realized, and lapsed into silence.''' ,'''The U.S. - the idea that the U.S. has introduced and imposed principles of international law, that's hardly even a joke. The United States has even gone so far as to veto Security Council resolutions calling on all states to observe international law. That was in the 1980s under Reagan.''' ,'''The level of destruction and terror and violence carried out by the powerful states far exceeds anything that can imaginably can be done by groups that are called terrorists and subnational groups.''' ,'''When George W. Bush came into office, North Korea had maybe one nuclear weapon and verifiably wasn't producing any more.''' ,'''Over the years, there have been a series of concepts developed to justify the use of force in international affairs for a long period. It was possible to justify it on the pretext, which usually turned out to have very little substance, that the U.S. was defending itself against the communist menace. By the 1980s, that was wearing pretty thin.''' ,'''If you do a Google search, you will probably read a lot of stuff about how I am someone who wants to kill all the Jews and hates the United States.''' ,'''The American escalation of the war in Laos provoked a response by the Communist forces, which now control more of Laos than ever before.''' ,'''The Internet has compromised the quality of debate.''' ,'''Rational discussion is useful only when there is a significant base of shared assumptions.''' ,'''If you don't like what someone has to say, argue with them.''' ,'''Obama's primary constituency was financial institutions. They were the core of the funding for his campaign. They expect to be paid back. And they were. They were paid back by coming out richer and more powerful than they were before the crisis that they created.''' ,'''The internet could be a very positive step towards education, organisation and participation in a meaningful society.''' ,'''Some may remember, if you have good memories, that there used to be a concept in Anglo-American law called a presumption of innocence, innocent until proven guilty in a court of law. Now that's so deep in history that there's no point even bringing it up, but it did once exist.''' ,'''Is the Iranian record of intervention and terror worse than that of the U.S.?''' ,'''When General Allenby conquered Jerusalem during World War I, he was hailed in the American press as Richard the Lion-Hearted, who had at last won the Crusades and driven the pagans out of the Holy Land.''' ,'''I don't have any oratory skills. But I would not use them if I had.''' ,'''I'm about as monolingual as you come, but nevertheless, I have a variety of different languages at my command, different styles, different ways of talking, which do involve different parameter settings.''' ,'''The effort to try to present the Social Security program as if it's a major problem, that's just a hidden way of trying to undermine and destroy it.''' ,'''From the U.S. point of view, negotiations are, in effect, a way for Israel to continue its policies of systematically taking over whatever it wants in the West Bank, maintaining the brutal siege on Gaza, separating Gaza from the West Bank and, of course, occupying the Syrian Golan heights, all with full U.S. support.''' ,'''In September 1993, President Clinton presided over a handshake between Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat on the White House lawn - the climax of a 'day of awe,' as the press described it.''' ,'''If a child from an Amazonian hunter-gatherer tribe comes to Boston, is raised in Boston, that child will be indistinguishable in language capacities from my children growing up here, and vice versa.''' ,'''If you have to control people, you have to have an administrative force that does it. So in U.S. industry, even more than elsewhere, there's layer after layer of management - a kind of economic waste, but useful for control and domination. And the same is true in universities.''' ,'''If workers are more insecure, that's very 'healthy' for the society, because if workers are insecure, they won't ask for wages, they won't go on strike, they won't call for benefits; they'll serve the masters gladly and passively. And that's optimal for corporations' economic health.''' ,'''In some respects, South African apartheid was more vicious than Israeli practices, and in some respects the opposite is true.''' ,'''Up until the First World War, when people turned anti-German, Germany had been described by American political scientists as the model of democracy.''' ,'''I remember at the age of five travelling on a trolley car with my mother past a group of women on a picket line at a textile plant, seeing them being viciously beaten by security people. So that kind of thing stayed with me.''' ,'''Concentration of wealth yields concentration of political power. And concentration of political power gives rise to legislation that increases and accelerates the cycle.''' ,'''Reagan was extreme. Beginning of his administration, one of the first things was to call in scabs - hadn't been done for a long time, and it's illegal in most countries - in the air controller strike.''' ,'''When you look at a corporation, just like when you look at a slave owner, you want to distinguish between the institution and the individual. So slavery, for example, or other forms of tyranny, are inherently monstrous. The individuals participating in them may be the nicest guys you can imagine.''' ,'''In the universities, cheap, vulnerable labor means adjuncts and graduate students.''' ,'''There's a lot of fuss on the Left about election irregularities, like, you know, the voting machines were tampered with, they didn't count the votes right, and so on. That's all accurate and of some importance, but of far more importance is the fact that elections just don't take place, not in any meaningful sense of the term 'election.'''' ,'''By very conservative estimates, Turkish repression of Kurds in the 1990s falls in the category of Kosovo. It peaked in the early 1990s; one index is the flight of more than a million Kurds from the countryside to the unofficial Kurdish capital, Diyarbakir, from 1990 to 1994, as the Turkish army was devastating the countryside.''' ,'''Everyone who is critical of Israeli policy is deluged by crazed messages intended to flood their email system or, more insidiously, passwords are accessed and messages sent out under their name! I'm sure it's illegal. It's also an effort to undermine free speech.''' ,'''Mr. Mijanovi and those associated with him are the hope and the conscience of the Yugoslav revolution.''' ,'''The United States is afraid of China; it is not a military threat to anyone and is the least aggressive of all the major military powers.''' ,'''The list of U.S. vetoes at the Security Council to protect Israeli aggression and occupation is huge.''' ,'''In the literal sense, there has been no relevant evolution since the trek from Africa. But there has been substantial progress towards higher standards of rights, justice and freedom - along with all too many illustrations of how remote is the goal of a decent society.''' ,'''Nationalism has a way of oppressing others.''' ,'''Suppose I criticise Iran. What impact does that have? The only impact it has is in fortifying those who want to carry out policies I don't agree with, like bombing.''' ,'''No matter what engineering field you're in, you learn the same basic science and mathematics. And then maybe you learn a little bit about how to apply it.''' ,'''In the United States, we can do almost anything we want. It's not like Egypt, where you're going to get murdered by the security forces.''' ,'''The U.S. has strategic and economic interests in Southeast Asia that must be secured. Holding Indochina is essential to securing these interests. Therefore, we must hold Indochina.''' ,'''Free speech has been used by the Supreme Court to give immense power to the wealthiest members of our society.''' ,'''On October 15, 1965, an estimated 70,000 people took part in large-scale anti-war demonstrations.''' ,'''History shows that, more often than not, loss of sovereignty leads to liberalisation imposed in the interests of the powerful.''' ,'''The whole infrastructure of air travel was, and is, part of government policy. It is not a natural development of a free economic system - at least not in the way that is claimed. The same is true of the roads, of course.''' ,'''If you care about other people, you might try to organize to undermine power and authority. That's not going to happen if you care only about yourself.''' ,'''The probability of apocalypse soon cannot be realistically estimated, but it is surely too high for any sane person to contemplate with equanimity.''' ,'''Remember, weapons of mass destruction don't mean missiles.''' ,'''State formation has been a brutal project, with many hideous consequences. But the results exist, and their pernicious aspects should be overcome.''' ,'''Wanton killing of innocent civilians is terrorism, not a war against terrorism.''' ,'''Undoubtedly, the U.S. harbors leading international terrorists, people described by the F.B.I. and the Justice Department as leading terrorists, like Orlando Bosch, now Posada Carriles, not to speak of those who actually implement state terrorism.''' ,'''The Occupy movement is - it was a big surprise.''' ,'''I have often thought that if a rational Fascist dictatorship were to exist, then it would choose the American system.''' ,'''The prescription for endless war poses a far greater danger to Americans than perceived enemies do, for reasons the terrorist organisations understand very well.''' ,'''I don't usually admire Sarah Palin, but when she was making fun of this 'hopey changey stuff,' she was right: there was nothing there.''' ,'''In societies that profess some respect for law, suspects are apprehended and brought to fair trial. I stress 'suspects.'''' ,'''France had a policy, initiated by General de Gaulle, of trying to turn Europe into what was then called a 'third force,' independent of the two superpowers, so Europe should pursue an independent course.''' ,'''I don't pay a lot of attention to polls.''' ,'''Today, we have private airline companies, but if you take a look at a Boeing plane next time you travel, you'll see that you are basically taking a ride on a modified bomber.''' ,'''Popular struggles to bring about a freer and more just society have been resisted by violence and repression, and massive efforts to control opinion and attitudes. Over time, however, they have met with considerable success, even though there is a long way to go, and there is often regression.''' ,'''As you deal with more and more complex systems, it becomes harder and harder to find deep and interesting properties.''' ,'''Before the 1970s, banks were banks. They did what banks were supposed to do in a state capitalist economy: they took unused funds from your bank account, for example, and transferred them to some potentially useful purpose like helping a family buy a home or send a kid to college.''' ,'''It could be - and it has been argued, in my view rather plausibly, though neuroscientists don't like it - that neuroscience for the last couple hundred years has been on the wrong track.''' ,'''Dr. Karel Culik is an outstanding applied mathematician, a specialist in algebra, logic, computer sciences and mathematical linguistics. In 1965, he visited the linguistics research program at MIT, and we have worked together on several projects since.''' ,'''If you are working 50 hours a week in a factory, you don't have time to read 10 newspapers a day and go back to declassified government archives. But such people may have far-reaching insights into the way the world works.''' ,'''On the Internet, you think everything is going to be public.''' ,'''When Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982, the U.N. vetoed several resolutions right away, calling for an end to the fighting and so on, and that was a hideous invasion.''' ,'''If you ask the CEO of some major corporation what he does, he will say, in all honesty, that he is slaving 20 hours a day to provide his customers with the best goods or services he can and creating the best possible working conditions for his employees.''' ,'''Obama himself has been highly supportive of Mubarak.''' ,'''Greece has been, in many ways, a partially dysfunctional society.

So take, say, physics - greatest progress there. But one of the reasons is that the physicists have an advantage that no other branch of sciences has. If something gets too complicated, they hand it to someone else.''' ,'''Pre-emptive war might fall within the framework of international law.''' ,'''With the development of industrial capitalism, a new and unanticipated system of injustice, it is libertarian socialism that has preserved and extended the radical humanist message of the Enlightenment and the classical liberal ideals that were perverted into an ideology to sustain the emerging social order.''' ,'''The U.S. is off the spectrum in religious commitment.''' ,'''Obama's policies have been approximately the same as Bush's, though there have been some slight differences, but that's not a great surprise. The Democrats supported Bush's policies.''' ,'''It's perfectly obvious that there is some genetic factor that distinguishes humans from other animals and that it is language-specific. The theory of that genetic component, whatever it turns out to be, is what is called universal grammar.''' ,'''The 'peace movement' exists only in the fantasies of the paranoid.''' ,'''In the US, there is basically one party - the business party. It has two factions, called Democrats and Republicans, which are somewhat different but carry out variations on the same policies. By and large, I am opposed to those policies. As is most of the population.''' ,'''Unlike Iran, Israel refuses to allow inspections at all, refuses to join the Non-Proliferation Treaty, has hundreds of nuclear weapons, has advanced delivery systems.''' ,'''The Oslo Accords in 1993 determined that the Gaza Strip and the West Bank are a single territorial entity which cannot be divided. Immediately, the United States and Israel set about separating the two and making sure that they would not be united.''' ,'''The very design of neoliberal principles is a direct attack on democracy.''' ,'''For 500 years, since European explorers came, Latin American countries had been separated from one another. They had very limited relations. Integration is a prerequisite for independence.''' ,'''Some of the most moving experiences I've had are just in black churches in the South, during the Civil Rights Movement, where people were getting beaten, killed, really struggling for the most elementary rights.''' ,'''In the late 1990s, some of the worst terrorist atrocities in the world were what the Turkish government itself called state terror, namely massive atrocities, 80 percent of the arms coming from the United States, millions of refugees, tens of thousands of people killed, hideous repression, that's international terror, and we can go on and on.''' ,'''It was during the Reagan years that defiance of international law and the U.N. Charter became entirely open.''' ,'''As far as U.S. intelligence knows, Iran is developing nuclear capacities, but they don't know if they are trying to develop nuclear weapons or not. Chances are they're developing what's called 'nuclear capability,' which many states have. That is the ability to have nuclear weapons if they decide to do it. That's not a crime.''' ,'''The Republican Party has become overwhelmingly so extreme that it's hardly a traditional political party anymore.''' ,'''Reviewing the record of American intervention in Indochina in the Pentagon Papers, one cannot fail to be struck by the continuity of basic assumptions from one administration to the next.

They have their own power, serving segments of the population that are dominant and rich.''' ,'''Governments don't control people like they used to.''' ,'''Nineteen sixty-eight was one exciting moment in a much larger movement. It spawned a whole range of movements. There wouldn't have been an international global solidarity movement, for instance, without the events of 1968. It was enormous, in terms of human rights, ethnic rights, a concern for the environment, too.''' ,'''I once did a three-hour interview with Radio Oxford only to be told the microphone hadn't picked me up.''' ,'''Anti-Americanism is a pure totalitarian concept. The very notion is idiotic.''' ,'''I like Gramsci. He's an important person.''' ,'''There's never been anything like the so-called Vietnam Syndrome: it's mostly a fabrication.''' ,'''Debt is a trap, especially student debt, which is enormous, far larger than credit card debt. It's a trap for the rest of your life because the laws are designed so that you can't get out of it. If a business, say, gets in too much debt, it can declare bankruptcy, but individuals can almost never be relieved of student debt through bankruptcy.''' ,'''Perhaps the most striking assault on the foundations of traditional liberties is a little-known case brought to the Supreme Court by the Obama administration, Holder v.

You'd expect it to be far more advanced than East Asia, but it had the disadvantage of being under imperialist wings.''' ,'''In the early days of the military Arpanet, my daughter was studying in Nicaragua. Because the U.S. was essentially at war with them, contact was difficult. I managed to use MIT's Arpanet connection, and she found one, so we could communicate thanks to the Pentagon!''' ,'''By most accounts, Aristide is the most popular figure in Haiti.''' ,'''In 1993, Israel and North Korea were moving towards an agreement in which North Korea would stop sending any missiles or military technology to the Middle East and Israel would recognize that country. President Clinton intervened and blocked it.''' ,'''Britain kept its position as the dominant world power well into the 20th century despite steady decline.

Well, that was followed by a missile exchange for a couple of weeks in both directions.''' ,'''There's very little dislike of Americans in the world, shown by repeated polls, and the dissatisfaction - that is, the hatred and the anger - they come from acceptance of American values, not a rejection of them, and recognition that they're rejected by the U.S. government and by U.S. elites, which does lead to hatred and anger.''' ,'''Significant anniversaries are solemnly commemorated - Japan's attack on the U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor, for example.''' ,'''The Iraq War was the first conflict in western history in which an imperialist war was massively protested against before it had even been launched.''' ,'''Changes and progress very rarely are gifts from above. They come out of struggles from below.''' ,'''Egypt is the second-largest recipient over a long period of U.S. military and economic aid. Israel is first.''' ,'''As a Zionist youth leader in the 1940s, I was among those who called for a binational state in Mandatory Palestine.

So we know a good deal about that.''' ,'''People who criticize power in the Jewish community are regarded the way Ahab treated Elijah: You're a traitor.''' ,'''The western mantra is that Israel seeks negotiations without preconditions, while the Palestinians refuse. The opposite is more accurate.''' ,'''Presented with the claims of nineteenth-century racist anthropology, a rational person will ask two sorts of questions: 'What is the scientific status of the claims?'

Money was not borrowed by campesinos, assembly plant workers, or slum-dwellers. The mass of the population gained little from borrowing, indeed often suffered grievously from its effects.''' ,'''Even in the 1950s, President Eisenhower was concerned about what he called a campaign of hatred of the U.S. in the Arab world, because of the perception on the Arab street that it supported harsh and oppressive regimes to take their oil.''' ,'''Somebody will be able to overcome any encryption technique you use!''' ,'''In the late Fifties and early Sixties, opposition to state terror and aggression and torture and so on was zero.

They won't tell you the evidence, and when anyone asks, they say, 'Well, you know: It's secret.'''' ,'''For a privileged minority, Western democracy provides the leisure, the facilities, and the training to seek the truth lying hidden behind the veil of distortion and misrepresentation, ideology and class interest, through which the events of current history are presented to us.''' ,'''Immediately after 11 September, the U.S. closed down the Somali charitable network Al-Barakaat on grounds that it was financing terror. This achievement was hailed one of the great successes of the 'war on terror.' In contrast, Washington's withdrawal of its charges as without merit a year later aroused little notice.''' ,'''In 1949, China declared independence - an event known in Western discourse as 'the loss of China' in the U.S. - with bitter recriminations and conflict over who was responsible for that loss.''' ,'''The American claim that the bombing of North Vietnam was directed against military targets does not withstand direct investigation.''' ,'''In the case of Yugoslavia v. NATO, one of the charges was genocide. The U.S. appealed to the court, saying that, by law, the United States is immune to the charge of genocide, self-immunized, and the court accepted that, so the case proceeded against the other NATO powers, but not against the United States.''' ,'''Rendition is just sending people abroad to be tortured.''' ,'''I've been interested in Japan since the 1930s, when I read about Japan's vicious crimes in Manchuria and China.''' ,'''It is easier to go to the Internet than to go to the library, undoubtedly. But the shift from no libraries to the existence of libraries was a much greater shift than what we've seen with the Internet's development.''' ,'''In every country except - industrial country except the United States, the government uses its massive purchasing power to negotiate drug prices. That's one of the reasons prices are so much higher in the United States than in other countries.''' ,'''There is no plausible theory under which the record of the Pentagon Papers can be interpreted as relating to the national defense.''' ,'''The Bible is one of the most genocidal books in history.''' ,'''There is massive propaganda for everyone to consume. Consumption is good for profits and consumption is good for the political establishment.''' ,'''Under the worst conditions, horrendous conditions, people still, you know, fight for their rights and don't just succumb.''' ,'''Obama did organize a great large number of people and many enthusiastic people, what's called in the press 'Obama's Army.' But the army is supposed to take instructions, not to implement, to introduce, develop programs and call on its own candidate to implement them. That's critical.''' ,'''If humans were totally unstructured creatures, they would be... a tool which can properly be shaped by outside forces.''' ,'''I stated that Hiroshima and Nagasaki are 'among the most unspeakable crimes in history.' I took no position on just where they stand on the scale of horrors relative to Auschwitz, the bombing of Chungking, Lidice, and so on.''' ,'''Occasionally the conflict between 'what we stand for' and 'what we do' has been forthrightly addressed.''' ,'''You can live within the institutions and work hard to change them.''' ,'''American imperialism is often traced to the takeover of Cuba, Puerto Rico, and Hawaii in 1898.''' ,'''Radical Islamist extremists surely hope that an attack on Iraq will kill many people and destroy much of the country, providing recruits for terrorist actions.''' ,'''In the case of the environment, there's no one to bail it out.''' ,'''The childcare tax credit makes some sense.''' ,'''A war with Pakistan would be an utter disaster.''' ,'''I personally never expected anything of Obama, and wrote about it before the 2008 primaries.

But China, they've been there for 3,000 years and are paying no attention to the barbarians and don't see any need to.''' ,'''I didn't pay my taxes for years.''' ,'''In many respects, the United States is a great country. Freedom of speech is protected more than in any other country. It is also a very free society.''' ,'''In the late 1960s, the masses were supposed to be passive, not entering into the public arena and having their voices heard.''' ,'''Pakistan will never be able to match the Indian militarily, and the effort to do so is taking an immense toll on the society.''' ,'''What happened in the missile crisis in October 1962 has been prettified to make it look as if acts of courage and thoughtfulness abounded. The truth is that the whole episode was almost insane.''' ,'''In this possibly terminal phase of human existence, democracy and freedom are more than just ideals to be valued - they may be essential to survival.''' ,'''It is easy to dismiss the world as 'irrelevant,' or consumed by 'paranoid anti-Americanism,' but perhaps not wise.''' ,'''There's a War Crimes Act in the United States passed by a Republican Congress in 1996, which says that grave breaches of the Geneva Convention are subject to the death penalty. And that doesn't mean the soldier that committed them - that means the commanders.''' ,'''There are massive efforts on the part of the internet's corporate owners to try to direct it to become a technique of marginalisation and control.''' ,'''In November 2007, the White House issued a Declaration of Principles demanding that U.S. forces must remain indefinitely in Iraq and committing Iraq to privilege American investors.''' ,'''The 'free-floating intellectual' may occupy himself with problems because of their inherent interest and importance, perhaps to little effect.''' ,'''There is every likelihood that the Jihadi movement, much of it highly critical of bin Laden, could have been split and undermined after 9/11.''' ,'''As international support for Obama's decision to attack Syria has collapsed, along with the credibility of government claims, the administration has fallen back on a standard pretext for war crimes when all else fails: the credibility of the threats of the self-designated policeman of the world.''' ,'''There's a tremendous gap between public opinion and public policy.''' ,'''Since the civil war in Laos was resumed in earnest in 1963, American participation has been veiled in secrecy.''' ,'''NATO was constructed on the - with the reason, whether one believes it or not, that it was going to defend Western Europe from Russian assault. Once the Berlin Wall fell and the Soviet Union was beginning to collapse, that reason was gone. So, first question: why does NATO exist?''' ,'''Chinese military spending is carefully monitored by the United States.''' ,'''When I was a college student and I got interested in linguistics the concern among students was, this is a lot of fun, but after we have done a structural analysis of every language in the world what's left? It was assumed there were basically no puzzles.''' ,'''In America, the professor talks to the mechanic. They are in the same category.''' ,'''I do not think psychoanalysis has a scientific basis.

But that does not help the victims. And, in fact, it's likely to harm them.''' ,'''Every time there has been an effort by the Haitian people to overcome the misery and poverty that comes from 200 years of bitter attacks, really bitter, the U.S. steps in and blocks it.''' ,'''Public opinion in Egypt is very antagonistic to the way the dictatorship, Mubarak dictatorship, interpreted relations with Israel. Very antagonistic.''' ,'''Iran has little capacity to deploy force. Its strategic doctrines are defensive, designed to deter invasion long enough for diplomacy to set it.''' ,'''The former colonies, in Latin America in particular, have a better chance than ever before to overcome centuries of subjugation, violence and foreign intervention, which they have so far survived as dependencies with islands of luxury in a sea of misery.''' ,'''As for my own views, they've of course evolved over the years. This conception of 'renouncing beliefs' is very odd, as if we're in some kind of religious cult. I 'renounce beliefs' practically every time I think about the topics or find out what someone else is thinking.''' ,'''If you look back at the history of the twentieth century, Germany alone had practically destroyed Russia several times.''' ,'''A siege is an act of war.''' ,'''In 1962, war was avoided by Khrushchev's willingness to accept Kennedy's hegemonic demands.''' ,'''In Latin America, specialists and polling organisations have, for some time, observed that the extension of formal democracy was accompanied by an increasing disillusionment about democracy and a lack of faith in democratic institutions.''' ,'''Unlimited economic growth has the marvelous quality of stilling discontent while maintaining privilege, a fact that has not gone unnoticed among liberal economists.''' ,'''I have trouble reading modern Hebrew.
