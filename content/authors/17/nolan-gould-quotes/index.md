- When I talk to other young people, I try to be as straightforward as possible. I'm a kid. I love getting outdoors. You should get outside, too!
- I like reading, writing, hiking, camping, free running, surfing, rock climbing, long boarding, and so much more.
- I'm on my computer a lot, but I swear I have an excuse! I spend about nine hours on media a day, but seven or eight of those are doing my schoolwork.
- I started acting when I was, like, three. My brother was really smart, and he wasn't being challenged enough, so my mom put him in the theater class. And I obviously followed him.
- I collect Hot Wheels. I collect glass. I collect coins. And I collect cards.
- My schedule is usually pretty busy, so when I wake up in the morning, first thing I usually do is turn on the TV and watch shows from the night before. I eat breakfast and watch TV and try to wake up.
- In this world, one thing you should definitely strive for is originality. Just be who you are, and be your own person. That's what will make you stand out.
- Acting isn't a sure thing. We're not set to have jobs for the rest of lives, and fame is really fickle.
- I always put a lot of priority on my education, even if that means taking classes after work or on the weekends.
- I know girls like musicians!
- I'm always kind of hoping that I'll get a movie that shoots in Alabama so I can go back and kind of get a break from my city life.
- I do an improv show on Sunday where we have a class, and then afterwards we go and do a live performance in front of an audience.
- My dad was in the military. It was difficult sometimes, because he would have to be away a lot, and we would have to move around a lot. Trying to adapt to new schools and new places can be really tough.
- During long car rides to the set, after I study my script, I go onto my iPad to read books and play games.
- If you want to be an actor, you should keep confident. Don't get too much of an ego and become not humble. But you should have esteem and not feel bad when you don't book something. So I think you should just stay humble, but you also need to have some esteem to make yourself keep going.
- I like to go hiking. I like to go rappelling, swimming, biking. I go boogie-boarding. I collect Hot Wheels. I collect glass. I collect coins. And I collect cards.
- I need something to fall back on if fame doesn't work. I'll have to become an economist or something.
- Probably the thing I use most in media is video games, but I have to limit myself. If I wake up super early in the morning, and I'm not tired, I'll play video games until everybody gets up.
- I'm pretty much using media all day because my school is online. It's sort of like homeschooling but also like going to real school - you log in and do all your work and email it to the teacher, and we have a teacher who oversees us on set.
- As for kids who are struggling personally, ignore the bullies! Who cares what they think? A lot of the time, they're not thinking, so you shouldn't take their words to heart. Ignore, ignore, ignore, and keep pushing forward.
- I don't believe that anyone can see the Grand Canyon area for themselves and not know that we have to do everything we can to protect it for future generations.
