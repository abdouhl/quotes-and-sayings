Then we figured out we were first cousins! My late mother was the sister of Don and Phil's father, Ike Everly.''' ,'''I do mostly Southern landscapes. I do beautiful old barns that are falling down, and beautiful trees reflecting in the water. My lovely wife Dorothy and I travel quite a bit, so I take pictures of different things that inspire me to come home, when I come home here in North Carolina, into my art studio and paint these things.''' ,]
