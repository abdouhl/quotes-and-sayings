- My first show, in England, was called 'Soldier, Soldier.'

- There wasn't very much going on in London about five years ago, and I just took a ticket on spec and went to Los Angeles. I think it was in my second week that I auditioned for 'Battlestar.'
- I think the level of devotion some sci-fi fans display turns other people off.
- You don't want to diminish anybody's pain and suffering.
