- It shouldn't be the case that young people feel they have to go to London to get the good quality jobs. We have to make sure those jobs are available everywhere in the country.
- There is an awful lot you can accomplish by being a vocal champion for a certain cause.
- There is a pattern whereby even if you can't map out the exact policies and issues that might be dangerous for you as an individual... we've seen this before. And you don't have to join all the dots to see it ends badly. There shouldn't be that kind of fear from any community in the UK about a future government.
- When there are legitimate concerns and frustrations it is never cool to marginalise and ridicule the people who have those concerns.
- So the better thing to do is to be right and be doing the right things for the right reasons rather than trying to be cool and popular and saying whatever thing is going to get good headlines or a big cheer at Glastonbury.

- I don't want to be the Grinch.
- A failure to listen to the party's grassroots was a charge regularly levelled at Theresa May - particularly over Brexit.
- One of the big learnings both out of the referendum, and out of 2017 general election is that parties that don't have a professional network on the ground slightly lose the ability to hear what local people are saying, so we've reestablished our network of campaign managers out in the field.
- Basically the real decision making in the Labour party is old white men, assisted by young, posh men.
- Actually, Brexit is an incredibly important issue, but it's not the only issue. And to be a credible party of Government you need to have plans for everything, not just for the delivery of Brexit.
- The Labour party still really has no idea why their people voted for Brexit. They still think that basically it's naive Labour voters being conned by terribly clever Tories.
- We have all had, on all sides of the House - some truly appalling things said about us. I've been called a race traitor, a coconut, a sell out. It's horrible and it's never the kind of thing that should be normalised or accepted.
- Voters don't just want to see detached and distant faces on TV, they want to feel that they know the people that they're trying to vote for.
- It's the nature often on social media that people say things without really thinking through their position.
- One of the things that we've got to understand... is that politics of identity has never gone away. And where people have had a strong identity, geographically, culturally, in terms of their employment... if that's gone and not being replaced by something else, then I think the right-of-centre's got to wake up to that.
- It is uncomfortable seeing how very divisive politics has become.
- We just fundamentally forgot that people want to vote for something positive. They want to be shown what the good life for them personally looks like.

- The Cabinet makes collective decision and when the Cabinet speaks it speaks with one voice.
- I, Daniel Blake' is a powerful and moving film. But it is a political polemic and is particularly unfair on the public sector professionals who work in Job Centre Plus, in my experience they are proactive and helpful. Completely at odds with their portrayal in the film.
- Once Brexit is delivered, we then need to think about how we can make the Conservatives look new and sound different.
- When I have been speaking to people in Braintree and at other places in the country they really didn't buy into Labour's economic offer, didn't buy into scare stories about the NHS and clearly didn't trust Jeremy Corbyn.
- I'm in the most diverse Cabinet.
- I regularly help constituents who have had problems with the benefits system.
- Both the country, and my party, are beset with division. We cannot bring the country back together unless the party of government is united, and the party cannot unite if it is led from its fringes.

- Once we can Brexit delivered, we can then start talking about those other issues which are much better at bringing people together. We will talk about local health provision, education, farming policing and the economy.
- Being hip, being popular, being cool, that's really easy. Until you have to make tough decisions. And when you have to make tough decisions, that veneer of coolness comes off real quick.

- If we went around just throwing people on the scrap heap because of one or two things that they might have done in their youth, I think we would lose a lot of talent.
