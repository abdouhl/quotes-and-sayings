quotes = ['''I'm always a player who has taken fairly rough treatment, to be honest. I think my time in Scotland typified that because I think there was one game where I set a record for being fouled ten or 11 times in a game.''' ,'''Norwich is a brilliant platform for me.''' ,'''I started lower down the leagues with Coventry, so I'd had that taste of first-team action at a young age. I'd already played 40 or 50 games before moving on, and when I got to Norwich, I had to bide my time at the start.''' ,'''I like to get the fans off their seats, and hopefully I can do that.''' ,'''I was only in Scotland for four months or something, but I look back at that, and it was a big learning curve for me in that short spell. I went there with an open mind to show everyone in Scotland what I was about. Looking back, I am very glad with the decision I made.''' ,'''I was always smaller than the rest coming up at Coventry, and I developed physically more in the later stages.''' ,'''I have always been comfortable in possession, but it is tracking and tackling that I have been working on.''' ,'''I've loved every second of playing my first season in the Premier League. I feel like I belong here, and this is the level I want to be at for the rest of my career.''' ,'''The Premier League is the best league, and I've enjoyed every second of it.''' ,'''I like to chip in with goals because I'm an attacking player, and that's what an attacking player should do.''' ,'''I got to play first-team men's football from a young age.''' ,'''I feel like I'm quite harsh on myself.''' ,'''Representing your country at any level is amazing.''' ,'''The No 10 position is my favourite role, and I'm a player who likes to play in between the lines and try and break that midfield line.''' ,'''If, just because it's the Premier League, I started trying to play the simple pass instead of trying the harder pass, that is not the type of person I am, to be honest.''' ,'''One of my biggest attributes, if you speak to my coaches from when I was a young lad, is that I've always believed in my own ability and been a confident young man.''' ,'''You should always want more. If you get comfortable with what you have done, you can never go to that next level.''' ,'''I've always believed in myself.''' ,'''I've got a lot of respect for Claude Puel because he brought me to Leicester and to the Premier League and played me in most of the games. I have a lot of respect on that front.''' ,'''There is no bigger stage than Old Trafford on the opening day of the season.''' ,'''I think I have the right balance of believing in my own ability and having that confidence on the pitch: people watching you thinking, 'He knows he's a good player,' but without taking it to that level where it's, 'He's an arrogant so-and-so.'''' ,'''I'm learning and constantly getting better.''' ,'''I still pinch myself when I see myself on 'Match of the Day' - it's at times like that you realise how far you've come.''' ,'''It was tough to go to Norwich and not play after doing well at Coventry.''' ,'''Norwich gave me the platform to perform in the Championship, and between Daniel Farke and Stuart Webber, the manager and director of football, they gave me the opportunity to go out, express myself, and play. That's what led to my England call-up, which was something I'd always dreamed of, so it's something I'll always be grateful to them for.''' ,'''I've been brought up in a really lovely family, so I'm lucky.''' ,'''It was a hard decision to leave Norwich, and you have to take into account a lot of things - could I make the step up? Do I want to have another season of really showing what I can do?''' ,'''The only way you're going to improve is playing games and learning, being a regular week on week.''' ,'''I've dreamed of playing in the Premier League since I was a young boy.''' ,'''Dele Alli is probably the perfect example. He played loads of games for MK Dons at a young age. He got a move and kicked on from there because he had that experience behind him.''' ,'''I don't think you can ever get bored of winning awards.''' ,'''I was a Manchester United fan.''' ,'''The reason I'm in good form is not just down to myself: it's down to the manager and coaching staff improving my game.''' ,'''Derek McInnes gave me that platform to showcase what I can do, so I'm thankful.''' ,'''Whether Under-17 level, the 21s, or senior team, it's my dream to play for England as often as I can.''' ,'''Parents are the perfect people to talk to. They have no hidden agendas.''' ,'''I've always wanted to be a winner, the best player, the one that everyone is talking about. I'm greedy in that sense.''' ,'''I will try to showcase what I have to offer.''' ,'''I was an 18-year-old lad playing in a Scottish League Cup final at Hampden in front of 60,000 against Celtic. That's an experience I will never forget.''' ,'''I don't get nervous, because I have confidence in my ability.''' ,'''Me being at Coventry, instead of a big Premier League club, probably helped me develop. You don't get put in the academy system, playing Under-18s and Under-23s.''' ,'''Even at 22, you just want a manager to trust you.''' ,'''In the academies, people develop differently, and going into that No 10 role helped me because central midfield was always packed with big, strong boys.''' ,'''Every footballer wants to play in big games, in front of full houses, live on the telly.''' ,'''I love being on Sky Sports, the big hype around the games and stuff like that.''' ,'''The No.10 position is my favourite role.''' ,'''I learnt so much at Coventry - I was playing as a regular at 17, most weeks. And that's something that left me in good stead.''' ,'''There are quite a lot of young players around now with undoubted talent who get stuck in academies at big clubs.''' ,'''I'd like to think I'm an attacking creative midfielder who can assist with goals.''' ,'''There's never been a point when I've questioned myself. If I've ever had a setback at a club I've always made it my mission to show why I should be in the team instead of dwelling on it.''' ,'''I play the number ten role but also off the side or deeper.''' ,'''I am a player who likes to play in between the lines and try to break that midfield line, whether it's when I receive a pass or can go and show everyone what I am about.''' ,'''The ball is just whipped off you in the Premier League. You have to maintain focus.''' ,'''I can only speak highly of my time at Norwich. It was brilliant for me. I loved it there, and I think the fans loved me as well. We had a great relationship.''' ,'''I started in League One and went up into the Championship and then into the Premier League, so I've played a lot of games from quite a young age.''' ,'''You base your career on success.''' ,'''It definitely toughens you up. It makes you mature from a young age, living away from home.''' ,'''Players judge their careers based on medals and trophies, don't they, and they look back on what they have achieved.''' ,'''I was still only 19 when I went to Scotland, but it was a good loan move for me to play those extra games.''' ,'''In the Premier League, you don't have one second to breathe - you have to be on it from the first minute. If you lose focus - just for a few seconds - the game will pass you by. It's 100 miles an hour.''' ,'''Set pieces are something I work hard at after training, and I hit quite a lot every day.''' ,'''Being booked for simulation is never good.''' ,'''I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Aberdeen.''' ,'''My ambition is to play in the Premier League, like every player.''' ,'''I go into each game with the same mindset of showing people what I can do and letting the rest take care of itself.''' ,'''The Premier League is the toughest league in the world, so it's never going to be easy to get minutes.''' ,'''Coming on as a sub, it's always different - you never know what the game is going to be like.''' ,'''I've had to make lots of sacrifices, particularly off the pitch.''' ,'''All the moves I've made have come after I sat down with my family and my agent and thought what was the best move. I've never rushed into something, never gone anywhere where I wasn't sure 100%.''' ,'''Playing in the Championship and starting games, I'm learning something new every day and constantly improving my game.''' ,'''When I represent the Under-21s and sing the national anthem, there is no better feeling.''' ,'''I like playing in the later stages of games because there is more space when everybody's legs are tired.''' ,]
