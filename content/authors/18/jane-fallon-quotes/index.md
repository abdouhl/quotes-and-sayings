- Bizarrely, I've been called selfish for not having children. Surely it's more selfish to have a child when you don't really want a child?
- I hope I never become that person who is all about getting Botox.
- I'm not a gossip. The worst thing anyone can say to me is, 'Ooh, I've got some gossip.' I'm like, 'Oh, shut up.'
- My whole life, I've wanted to be a novelist.

- My dad used to cut out newspaper ads and post them to me in the hope I'd get a proper job.

- I am too much of a worrier. I'm the person who thinks about calling round all the hospitals when someone is five minutes later than they said they would be.

- I like to dance and throw things around as I cook.
- I love L.A. for a couple of days - I like the healthy food - but it's a one-industry town.
- My biggest source of inspiration is listening to people's conversations. I'm a big eavesdropper.
- What I find weird is that the term 'chick lit' is used to encompass literally anything a woman writes about relationships. It's the assumption that because you're female, you must write in a certain way. I don't understand why that is - it is a bit demeaning.
- After my eye test, I was told I was showing symptoms of glaucoma. I realised - but only in retrospect - that pains in my eyes and the feeling of pressure that I had been experiencing must have been because of that. I'd assumed they were symptoms of migraines.

- What I like about writing novels is that I'm in my own world for nine months.
- I have always had a bee in my bonnet about being seen to do things for myself.
- The idea of appearing in front of an audience or on live TV terrifies me.
- As an adult, I had to accept that I was not a natural distance runner. Anything more than about 400 metres had me gasping and wheezing like a broken accordion.

- I rarely go out at night - usually once every two weeks. I'm much happier staying in.
- You come across those real, genuine friendships so rarely in your life and they are so precious, you know the people who really have your back, who love you unconditionally and aren't your family. You don't stumble across those people very often.

- I just feel that if you're going to have kids, you need to believe that, emotionally, you can give them a really good life.
- There's something lovely about writing a book, doing what you want. I love the solitariness of it.
- Grandchildren are the Furbies of the offspring world. They're cute, they're funny, you can play with them and then put them away when they start to get on your nerves.
- I'm stupidly shy. It's the thing I dislike most about myself.
- Whenever I'm out, I have a bit of a yearning to be in my house, to be able to shut the door on the world.

- If I die, I know the news item would be, 'Partner of Ricky Gervais and novelist dies.' That would come first. But I've come to terms with it. As long as they do still add the 'and novelist,' that will be fine.

- I'm not a girly girl at all.
