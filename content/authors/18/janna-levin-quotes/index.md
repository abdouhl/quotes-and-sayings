- Black holes can bang against space-time as mallets on a drum and have a very characteristic song.
- The Earth isn't an infinite sheet that carries on for ever, but it doesn't have an edge, either. It's compact and connected.
- We have never observed infinity in nature. Whenever you have infinities in a theory, that's where the theory fails as a description of nature. And if space was born in the Big Bang, yet is infinite now, we are forced to believe that it's instantaneously, infinitely big. It seems absurd.
- We have to wonder, if there is a multiverse, in some other patch of that multiverse are there creatures?
- Now, our Sun will not collapse to a black hole. It's actually not massive enough.
- Ambiguity is very interesting in writing; it's not very interesting in science.
- I'd like to convince you that the universe has a soundtrack and that soundtrack is played on space itself, because space can wobble like a drum.
- I think there's a certain lyricism in the telling of a scientific story.
- I would say the connection between art and science is very tenuous for me. It's just that I'm interested in both. I don't think that my interest in art affects the kind of science that I do.
