- There's nothing wrong with going out and playing for the fans that have been with you forever. I get it. It looks like a lot of fun. But that's not the thing that drives me. I already did that, and I appreciate everything I got from it, but I want to do something new and fresh.
- I don't need a Hollywood girl. They're crazy. If you're with an actress, you don't know who you're going to come home to every day. But I wouldn't mind a relationship with the right girl. Every artist needs a muse.
- When you talk about *NSYNC or Backstreet Boys - we were like the New Kids, and New Kids were like the Bee Gees. But Girl Radical will be the first ones, and that's a crazy idea. That's what got us so excited.
- Everyone thinks I like to sleep. It's not that I like to sleep, it's that I don't like to get up! There is a difference.
- The beauty of music is that everyone hears it their own way, and every song you hear leaves an impression on you that alters the way you hear everything from that point on.
- With *NSYNC, we shopped our deal for a year in America, sang a capella in everybody's office, then moved to Germany for almost two years and became popular there. A guy representing a rock band came to our show in Budapest, saw 60,000 people get excited for a band from America that nobody in America knew, and told someone at RCA.
- What drives me is to still feel creative and like I'm pushing myself as an artist.
- When I get bored, I'll zone out, and I'll just sit in front of my computer and start writing any random song that comes to mind.
- If there's one thing that I love as an entertainer, it's a spectacle. We all have looked up to either Michael Jackson or Madonna or Janet Jackson or anyone of those things. When I was in *N SYNC, I would watch any concert video ever and really drink it all in.
- I think I look for a muse in women. Someone I can just picture in my mind. Someone who respects herself and others. It isn't so much the things she says, it's mainly what she does. That's what make her all the more beautiful.
