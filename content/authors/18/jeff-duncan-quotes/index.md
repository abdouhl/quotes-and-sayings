quotes = ['''Radical Islamic jihadists have a long-term vision.

History has proven that.''' ,'''This isn't about deer hunting. The Second Amendment is about our right to keep and bear arms to defend ourselves.''' ,'''I haven't been in Washington long, but I have learned that it is a place filled with people who say one thing to get elected and do the opposite once they get there.''' ,'''I'm confident that Gov.

With a porous southern border, we have no idea who's in our country.''' ,'''Education needs to be personalized and flexible, which means education policy needs to originate from our local communities and not from some bureaucrats in Washington, D.C.''' ,'''Iran is a nation with American blood on its hands.''' ,'''Members of Congress and their staffs should be the first to feel the negative consequences of poorly written legislation, not the last.''' ,'''I think America is less safe on a lot fronts, and I disagree with the release of the information from Dianne Feinstein.

That's not just my belief; it's federal law.''' ,'''Parents and teachers alike are alarmed by this top-down approach to education that wrongly ties education money for states to the adoption of academic standards that do not fully reflect the values of South Carolina.''' ,'''The American people deserve answers about Benghazi before we move forward with military involvement in Syria's civil war.''' ,'''Despite my fierce opposition to the bill, I signed up for insurance through the exchanges and instructed my staff do the same.''' ,'''We need a leader who puts the health and well-being of the country ahead of 2016 politics.''' ,'''I want to see Netanyahu speak to the Congress and speak to the American people about the real situation in Israel, and let me just say, I stand with Israel 100 percent, and I will never waiver on that.''' ,'''It's perfectly reasonable for someone to be hesitant to share their personal information with the government.

We need his help.''' ,'''Why would you pass another law when the administration fails to enforce the current laws that are on the books. Why pass another one that's not going to be enforced either?''' ,'''We need a Commander-in-Chief, not a Campaigner-in-Chief.''' ,'''Somebody in this regime used chemical weapons, whether it was Assad - an order from him, or his brother, or someone else.

It limits individuals' ability to pick their own doctors and, over time, decreases the quality of care we provide in this country.''' ,'''We tried two moderate Republican candidates, McCain and Romney, and we lost both times.''' ,'''There are a lot of us that want to see limitations on refugee resettlement programs.''' ,'''Mark Meadows will fight for what's right, because he understands that higher taxes and more regulations are not the way to solve our country's problems.''' ,'''At least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the border in Texas.''' ,'''They say 'Ted Cruz can't win.'

We think we know it's a virus, but is it mutating? Can it be spread by airborne?''' ,'''I have sympathy for the people in Syria, and I do think there should be a worldwide response, but we should act cautiously.''' ,'''It was easy for Sanford to have a bully pulpit as governor.
