- I thought my body was going to change so quickly with pregnancy that I'd freak out. But it was really gradual.
- I'm a huge karaoke fan. Oh my God. I'm one of those girls who don't give the mic away. It's a problem. I'm a closeted pop star.
- When I started out in this business, dance was not at the height it is now. It was almost like, you're either a dancer or an actress.
- Every hotel room, every apartment we rent, I am sage-ing. And I have crystals that I travel with. It just makes me feel better.

- It's a great thing if you're a creative person and have some kind of acting or dance or singing, any art. I think it's great to be around people who support that and who are into it like you are, and you can have one big family and teachers who know what they're doing.

- I'm open to whatever the universe wants to bring me.

- Most actors and actresses are consumed by careers and getting ahead.
- Dance is a universal language, and whether you know how to dance or grew up training in dance, you have a respect for people who love to dance, and it's also visually very entertaining to watch a great dancer.
- Something about being a dancer connects you to your physical body. It's primal, earthy, sexual energy by nature. You feel your body in a certain way. Channing is very much the same way. He's very in tune with that.
- One of the beautiful gifts of dance is that you're so in tune with your body so early on. I was very comfortable in my skin at a very early age, performing onstage and wearing interesting costumes. And I give so much credit to my mom - she never made me feel that my costume was wrong, or bad, even when there was not a lot to them!
- I've always been a very sexual person.
- I had danced with Janet Jackson and P. Diddy so I had done a bunch of hip hop. Really and truly my roots are in modern and ballet but, professionally, that's not really out there any more, unfortunately, so these artists aren't really having a lot of ballet dancers behind them so I had to learn hip hop really quick.

- I was very personable and outgoing and was friends with most everybody in my class but I was a diehard dancer so I was constantly at dance classes and working toward my passion of dance.

- I would say I was always very ambitious and goal-oriented, but rather than being just a go-getter hustler, now I surrender a lot more and I trust my path a lot more.
- I'm from Texas and actually went to a regular high school, but every day after school I'd run to dance class and practice a lot and then go back the next day and stuff like that.
- I want to do stunts and play a badass. Like Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman. Physicality, fun, evilness.
- My first go at drinking did not go so well. I ended up getting sick in front of everybody. You know that Ginuwine song 'Pony'? It was playing at the party while I was getting sick. My entire senior year, everyone sang that around me. For a year. I would like that erased from my memory.
- I've been trying really hard to be more domesticated. It's not in my nature to clean and cook, and so I've been really good about it.

And being a dancer, and growing up in that world, you're so focused on yourself, and you're so focused on achieving goals, on finding perfection, and working on your craft.
- I think I was a bit naive when I was younger. I don't know what it was: I sort of felt tunnel vision - I didn't really have peripheral vision or see the world and what was happening.

- Your surroundings may change but your essence and your personality pretty much stay the same.
