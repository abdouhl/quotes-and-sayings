- I am first one in the gym, I do cardio before I have breakfast, and I am training hard every day.
- We are here to entertain and ultimately put smiles on people's faces.
- I listen to a lot of audio books and business-related books. All of the great businessmen have one thing in common: they write down their goals. They keep a journal. Not only that, but I write down my goals, and I check it off: whether or not I ate right, work out, check it off.

- My rise in WWE was kickstarted by my physical transformation.
- When I originally debuted in 2011, I was on 'SmackDown.' At the time, they were separate from 'RAW,' so I feel at home on 'SmackDown.'

- India has very motivated and talented people, and given the right opportunity, we always rise to the top.

- You never know when the break is going to come, so you have to keep plugging away.
