- Jinkx is a single mother and I've seen so many strong Jewish women.
- There's an old guard of drag, like the queens who got as big as they could possibly get before there was a TV show dedicated to drag queens.
- My long-term goal is to play a drag role or a female role in a Broadway production.
- My first drag role was the character Widow Simone in the ballet 'La Fille Mal Gardee.' She's a crazy social climbing woman trying to marry off her daughter to the wealthy town idiot. And in the middle of the show, she gets to perform a clog dance. I loved it.
- Drag has come a long way and people are respecting it, and giving drag queens and other people who defy gender norms more chances than they've ever been given before, but it's thanks to people like RuPaul, especially, who set that momentum going.
- Growing up as a gay boy during the holidays, there's the things you want to ask for, and then the things you ask for because you're afraid of asking for what you really want.
- I think the best way I've grown as an artist period, not just in relation to creating music, is having a lot more confidence in myself.
- We like to take pop songs that have really cool, complex melodies or lyrics and strip away all that fluff and electronic noise, and put them back as if they were written for a singer and a piano.
- You don't know that you're not a solo artist or standup comedian or drag cabaret artist until you try it.
- Drag is very regional.
- I've always preferred drag roles, because typically I get better costumes and I've always felt more connected with the female characters in my favorite shows than most of the male characters.
- First, it was a big deal for girls to dress more like guys. Then it was a big deal for straight men to be metereosexuals and care about their appearance in the way that a gay man would. Now we have to take it a step further - men should be able to not wear men's clothes if they don't want to.
- I want a computer that's bigger than my TV at home!
- When I found the 'Human Nature' music video as a teenager - I've been a drag queen since 15 - I just loved that music video so much because it's such a celebration of her femininity and her sexuality. I thought it was so powerful.
- I guess it wasn't really part of my story on 'Drag Race' but I'm a trained actor and singer.
- We should not be assuming anything for anyone else's gender, because gender is defined by the individual.
- I am a transgender identified person.
- If you have to mask the things you're insecure about, go ahead. Wear four pairs of pantyhose, pad your hips, boost your boobs - whatever it takes to walk out of the house feeling like you own the world. Because there's no reason to waste your life hating something you can change.
- I think my favourite thing about doing conventions is the parents taking their kids to see their favourite drag idols, because open-minded, progressive parents are making such a change in the world right now. The more open-minded these kids are being raised, the more hope I have for the future.
- What I love that has happened for years now with 'Drag Race' is the queens can go on to have any kind of career.
- It's not just putting on a little bit of makeup and putting on a dress. Some drag queens duct tape their heads, some drag queens are bound and strapped and pulled in every which direction. To be in drag is no small endeavor.
- Nowadays, 'Drag Race' shows how fantastic and amazing drag queens can be, so audiences won't sit through a boring show anymore. You have to keep people entertained.
- I've had some really great experiences in London and the fans are really loyal and always happy to have us.
- I play a lot of video games, cook meals for my best friends and chosen family in Seattle, and find time to visit my family in Portland, Oregon.

- I'm going to release whatever feels right and what I think is going to spread a good message about my artistry and what I believe.
- There was a time when I said I wouldn't do something like that but I've seen so many of my friends go on the 'All Stars' seasons and they seem to be having a lot of fun for the most part.
- I'm not the hugest fan of pop music and electro music, which is why 'The Inevitable Album' was entirely live instruments.
- Who knows where I would be if I hadn't gone on Drag Race and gotten that kick in the rear to step it up to the next level?
- Coming out as nonbinary was a response to a lot of criticism I got when it leaked that I'd be playing a nonbinary character on 'Steven Universe.' I never really had the words like nonbinary or gender fluid or gender nonconforming until after 'Drag Race' and that's when I first started identifying publicly as nonbinary.
- I did 'Hedwig and the Angry Inch' two years in a row in the winter in Seattle, and that was an amazing experience both times.
- A lot of people just feel really impacted and inspired by drag in ways that I don't think we, as self-absorbed drag queens, think about that often.
- I think there's something for anyone who wants to be a performer in Seattle.
- To be completely honest, I find New York to be too much city for me.
- That openness to experimentation in Seattle is how I learned a drag queen doesn't have to just be in her pageant gear and lip syncing to top 40. Drag can be off-the-wall, ridiculous, profound.
- I can't speak for the Jewish population, but I attribute my sense of humor to the tragic moments of my life. The best way to overcome certain tragedies is to develop a thick skin and sense of humor about things. Of course, I am very politically conscious and careful about my comedy. But when I do push an envelope, it's with a purpose.
- In the gay community there are not very many Jewish drag queens. I've always found that funny because there are a lot of Jewish gay people out there, so why aren't there more Jewish drag queens?
- There's a mixture of pride and self-loathing in Jewish female comedians that I've always admired and wanted to bring into Jinkx.
- No matter who you are in your day-to-day life, and no matter what you look like, and whatever insecurities you're dealing with, you can fully transform yourself. It's as easy as deciding to transform yourself.
- I really don't consider myself a man or a woman. I just kind of float in between and that's how I've always felt.
- I call myself a gorgeous anachronism.
- I'm extremely into Greek Mythology and know almost everything about the classic Greek myths.
- I very much treat my stage persona of Jinkx as a character I've created. Some drag artists do a look-based glamour act, and when they talk they're mostly just being themselves. In my case it's not Jinkx the drag queen, it's Jerrick Hoffer as Jinkx Monsoon.
- Most people tell me that what they are surprised about the most is that I sing really well, I always find it funny.
- When you become your own boss, and your artwork becomes your livelihood, it becomes the only thing you think about.
- I am only really attracted to people who are very open-minded and embrace and celebrate people who live outside the gender norm.
- It was like I have always had big dreams for my drag aspirations, and I talked myself into doing 'Drag Race.' I'm like, take a chance.
- I was so nervous competing against Lyneshia Sparx. She's so gorgeous, and she's hilarious. When you get to know her, she's the most lovely person.
- I've always been into the music of the 1920s and 1930s.
- Well, I think 'Addams Family Values' is definitely a gay icon movie and definitely a drag queen icon movie that no one ever talks about.
- We have such an amazing drag community, and I don't think people fully realize it about Seattle.
- As drag queens, you constantly have to be coming up with, 'What's the thing no one's ever seen before?'
- I love puns and plays on words, which is why I love RuPaul so much.
- When I'm doing an exaggerated character, I hope it's clear I don't think this is how women do, or should, act. There's aspects of Looney Tunes in drag. But there's something poignant about a man dressed as a woman, talking about gender. It can make you realize how similar the genders really are.
- I like to write my shows coming up with the stupidest things I can think of then finding a way I can incorporate a running theme or an underlying message that takes a stupid idea and gives it something worth watching.
- Australian audiences seem ready for anything you throw at them.
- You can't believe that you're the best at everything.
- I prefer to be gender fluid or non-gendered and I dress in drag almost every day of my life even if I'm not in my full Jinkx Monsoon persona - I'm the kind of person who does not dress like my assigned gender and I wear makeup every day and sometimes wear wigs as a boy.
- I used to hate that my lips are gigantic, and now I have huge red clown lips, and I love it.
- It's hard to have a fruitful romantic life when I'm never in one place for long.
- Ever since I was a kid I just thought that women had the better outfits, women had the better hair, women got to wear makeup. I just got jealous of what women got to do onstage. You dress up a man and ultimately it's just a different variation on the same kind of suit. There's a whole wide world of what women wear onstage.
- I feel that drag queens impersonate very strong, independent women who inspired us throughout our lives.
- I mean, drag is a universal language.
- The idea behind Jinkx is that she's a single mother and failed actress. One time she went out to a gay bar with her son, who's a gay adult, and started singing torch songs on the bar and became a hit. Now she's every gay boy's favorite cabaret act.
- It's silly, but 'You Really Got a Hold on Me' has been a favorite song of mine for a long time.
- I always say better busy than dead.
- I used to watch 'Death Becomes Her,' and I knew I wanted to become Meryl Streep.
- Don't be afraid of wearing a lot of makeup. Like, a lot. Your eyes deserve to be showcased. I think it's important to just remember that whatever you think you hate about yourself, there's a way to counter that with makeup and make that part of you beautiful.
- With Jinkx Monsoon, I strive to make her pretty and likable and have this bubbly, lovely personality. But then she can also be the most crass, out of the blue, kooky character.
- If I'm in drag, I'm playing Jinkx in some way.
- I want people to see that you don't have to be catty and mean to be a superstar.
- Gwyneth Paltrow - she always looks like she's about to cry.
- When your career and your passion one in the same there is very little downtime.
- Everyone should be able to express themselves in the way that best suits them - life is too short to spend it unhappy.
- I went to 'The Nutcracker' every year with my grandma and aunt. Then, in my early teen years, I thought I wanted to be a ballet dancer. I went real gung-ho in that direction, and I started performing in 'The Nutcracker.'
- I was raised Catholic primarily by my mom's side of the family. But at 18, I found out there was an adoption in the family, and that I was of Russian Jewish descent on my mom's side. After that, I started to look more into the philosophies and culture of Judaism.
- It used to be that I'd do drag, then get out of drag, and try and be as much of a boy as possible. That didn't feel entirely authentic for me, but it felt like what I had to do at the time.
- The more you embrace the weird crazy things about you, the more you find your tribe.
- It's not enough to just be a good singer. You have to know where your roots come from. If you sing jazz, you should know all about jazz. You should look into, as much as you possibly can, the history of it, so that you're and educated and well-informed performer.
- I started drag at 15 years old.
- Sarah Silverman has always been a huge influence on my comedy.
- I watched 'Drag Race Thailand' without any subtitles or voiceovers or anything; I don't speak Thai but I do speak drag, so I felt like I understood exactly what was going on, even though I couldn't speak Thai. I didn't understand anything they were saying but I knew exactly what was happening.
- I really like women who are able to be classy and poised and really well put together when the time is right, but also be complete clowns.
- I basically can't go to any gay bar in America without getting mobbed, which is fun and tiring.
- While I'm out of drag, I'm still extremely effeminate.
- I've been dressing like a girl my entire life!
- Drag is very much an art form, and all art goes through ebbs and flows and trends.
- I was always ready to submit my life to my career - but I don't think anything could have truly prepared me for the reality of that.
- I think this is a trait that runs throughout the queer community, the obsession with the hyper-feminine female villains. And we see it in Disney movies and in movies like 'Death Becomes Her,' and in characters like Poison Ivy and Catwoman.
- I want to be a role model and an advocate for social change.
- I don't think I knew Ru was a drag queen when I would see her in 'The Brady Bunch Movie.'
- In any kind of performance field, there are always going to be 101 people doing the exact same thing as you. You always constantly have to be thinking of, 'What's going to shock my audience the most?'
- Drag queens, our whole art form is about taking inspiration from artists we adore.
- Almost all the Disney villain witches are gay icons.
- If you hide, you won't find the eccentric people who will be your best friends.
- Christmas used to be my favorite time of year. But as an adult, it's a time of year where it's like, do I have to go through this again?
- I hope people realize that drag queens and queer people, we're not just archetypes and stereotypes. We're human beings with a lot to share. And a drag queen doesn't have to just be a clown, she can also be like a cooking TV personality or like a DJ, or a talk-show host. We should be able to infiltrate TV everywhere.
- I started drag in Portland, Oregon, but I don't feel that I came to life as a drag queen until I started working in Seattle. That's what really lit the rocket fuel in my career.
- If one drag queen penetrates the mainstream and opens up a new avenue for us to take with our careers, that means all of us can potentially do that.
- I find a lot of joy from legitimate theater. But Jinkx is my passion project.
