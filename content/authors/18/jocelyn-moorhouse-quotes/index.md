- I've got to love the film, not the money. Because I know what it's like not to have money - you still survive.
- I am interested in stories that concern women.
- Having two children with autism, it makes you really think about how we do relate to each other.
- I'm superstitious.
- When I was a teenager, I used to love the Bronte books, 'Wuthering Heights' and 'Jane Eyre.' In those books, the women do usually manage to heal the men, but in life, I've found it's often the woman gets wounded. Instead of healing a man, she gets affected by his cruelty.
- I would always get a lot of work as a writer, but that wasn't what I wanted to be. For me, I was only doing half of what I really wanted to do - write and direct.
- I always like being able to do something I haven't done before.
- I feel L.A. is unlike anything I've experienced. It's nice when I can relate to people, but that's not very often. I know they're out there, but I feel that there's a very big pressure here to be seen as being gorgeous and special. I don't think there's the same pressure in Australia.
