quotes = ['''You either keep the forest standing, which takes jobs away from indigenous people who need to feed themselves, or you cut down the trees, which affects the climate. In the long term, you have to protect the forest.''' ,'''The Swedish winters and summers hold the most enduring memories for me. Now, when I am back in Stockholm in November, it is difficult to imagine being able to ski to school. I think that is a tragedy.''' ,'''Deforestation will continue as long as cutting down and burning trees is more economic than preserving them.''' ,'''The key to saving the Amazon and the rest of the world's great rainforests is actually very simple: just put a fair price on the role they play in providing a quarter of the world's oxygen, a fifth of fresh water, and 60 percent of its species.''' ,'''Timber extraction provides big profits at the expense of local communities. Providing communities with unfettered access to harvest a forest that is protected in perpetuity provides better and more reliable incomes.''' ,'''With climate change, we are living on borrowed time. If we do not address these issues today, it is going to be much more expensive later on, and that is why we need to take action now.''' ,'''I am just a person who adores trees.''' ,'''I don't think politics and sport should be mixed up.''' ,]
