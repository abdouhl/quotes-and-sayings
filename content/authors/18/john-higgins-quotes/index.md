- A lot of nasty and untrue things have been said about me.
- Snooker players go into steady decline and lose their intensity after a while. But I will have real purpose the next five years. I want to prove people wrong and win a lot more tournaments.
- It would be fantastic to have the two top-ranked players in the world playing out of the same club.
