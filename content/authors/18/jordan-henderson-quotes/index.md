- There are a lot of players that want to go to the World Cup, so you have to be the player that goes out and performs and shows how much you want to go.
- Some people might say I'm old at 28, but I look at someone like James Milner. He's 32 and playing like he is 25 or something.
- I suppose when people are criticising you and saying that you are not really worthy of going to such a club as Liverpool, it gives you a little bit more drive and more desire to prove them wrong. And that can only help you in the long run: make you a little bit tougher mentally.

- When you come to a club like Liverpool, you need to perform straight away and consistently.
- When you are very young and come through at a club, like I did at Sunderland, I suppose people do not expect as much and have not really heard much about you. Whereas, when you sign for a club, the expectations are higher.

- I always say, whether it's Liverpool or England, it's not just me who is a leader.

- You never know what will happen in football.
- I have always wanted to fight no matter what position I am in, and whether that is Liverpool or England, I need to do more, and I need to do better because you have younger players, or players get signed for the club who push you and want to take your place, and you have to be better than them.
- I don't think I'll ever be another Steven Gerrard, to be honest!
- At Liverpool, Jurgen pretty much does everything, and we just follow him. Of course, we've still got leaders within the group to implement his message, but more often than not, we listen and then just do what he says.
