quotes = ['''No Spanish government has given into terror and no government will do that.''' ,'''It's true that the war in Iraq opened a distance in relations between part of Europe and the U.S. government, but our basic ties are stronger than that.

Sexual equality is a lot more effective against terrorism than military strength.''' ,]
