- The only thing I've ever wanted to do is really make people happy, offer some sort of positivity with music that I've written. The Chili Peppers do that for people. They're already established. I still want something that came out of me, and out of my heart.
- I always like to say that the music I'd like to make is somewhere between Pan Sonic and Scott Walker. But I don't sing anything like Scott Walker.
- I'll try not to let a day go by without making a song. I don't think I've created a lot of music.
- I don't think there should be a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, period.
- Dot Hacker, to me, sounds like a collection of all my tastes. I hear four people trying to fill up as much space as they can.
- The Chili Peppers have a real strict two-week on/two-week off policy - aside from me, everybody has families.
- I just like playing music and doing it with people that I care about. It doesn't really matter where. It's like, 'Why don't we just play piano in a small bar? Why do we want to make an arena full of people happy?'
- It's a weird thing to have a Hall of Fame for rock. It's weird that I spent years worshiping the Cure, and here's the Chili Peppers, and then one gets in one doesn't. It's ridiculous. In my heart of hearts, it means nothing to me, but I do understand it means a lot to other people. It creates positivity.
- I like really sparse electronics, lush arrangements, and interesting chord structures.
- Life seems terrible and disappointing, so you need to find something you need to make you stick around. Music that makes me happiest is the saddest music, with the most emotional feel.
- Since I was a teenager, I wanted to be in a band with my mates: my pure image of a band.
