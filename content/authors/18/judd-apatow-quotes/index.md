- My way of dealing with the world has always been to make fun of it and observe it but not take part in it. That's how I became a writer. But when you have kids, suddenly you have to be part of things. It leads almost to a breakdown because your whole defense mechanism is now really destructive.
- I think a lot of Hollywood is in retreat right now trying to figure out how to make money and make the safest bets.

- The thing that is incredibly helpful is that we screen the movies and we ask the audience if they like it or not and we ask a lot of questions and do testing on the movies.

- The moment you think of a joke is the best moment.
- If you look at who drives the box office numbers at these films, it's men.

- It's so difficult to shock America these days.
- People like the comedy more when they care about the characters.
- I always felt as a kid that I was underappreciated, invisible or weird, but I've always secretly thought people would one day appreciate what is different about me. I'm always putting that message out there.
- I don't know if you can be a born-again virgin.
- I love magazines and film critics, so I eat it up. I'm not one of those people who says 'I never read anything.' I generally read all of it.

- All of my jokes were about not being able to meet anybody. I didn't have any insight into anything - even my own insecurities.
- There's something honorable about holding out for love and not breaking up for the sake of the baby. I see people get divorced, and there is a part of me that thinks, I wonder how hard they tried?
- I'm the guy who gets uncomfortable. That's why I was able to write 'The 40-Year-Old Virgin' and 'Knocked Up.' I believe in those guys.
