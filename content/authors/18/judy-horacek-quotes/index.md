quotes = ['''Canberra was my home for many years, and there's a lot to love about it. It has a small population with a strong sense of community and is top-heavy with interesting, highly educated, socially progressive people - the opposite of the stereotypical image of dull public servants.''' ,'''The line between angry young woman and grumpy old lady is very fine.''' ,'''It really gets on my goat that people keep quoting Dorothea Mackellar's 'My Country' as proof that there is no such thing as climate change. A poem written more than 100 years ago by a homesick 19 year old versus an ever-increasing body of refereed scientific thought... hmm, hard to know which way to jump, really.''' ,'''While Melbourne and Sydney fight about who wears Australia's cultural crown, Canberra just gets on with it.''' ,'''That's a lot of words about the weather, but in Canberra you can't help but be aware of the seasons, and there is something wonderful about that. Okay, so there's a distinct lack of beach, but aside from that, the place grows on you.''' ,'''In Hell all the messages you ever left on answering machines will be played back to you.''' ,'''I'm not interested in showing a politician falling over; it's about the issue and making people think differently about that.''' ,'''I think older women's voices are the most hated voices in the world - whether it's because people are reminded of their mothers or what, I don't know.''' ,'''My cartoons haven't been about the politics of the day or about the personalities; I'm more interested in campaigning about the issues.''' ,'''The hardest thing about living in Canberra is that almost everyone who doesn't live here asks: 'Why on earth would you live in Canberra?' Loudly, and in a way they would never use to discuss anywhere else. And they never listen to the answer.''' ,]
