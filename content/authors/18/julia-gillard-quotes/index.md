quotes = ['''I know reform is never easy. But I know reform is right.''' ,'''For a profession that holds dear both the ability to vivisect politicians in prose and the expectation that these carved-up subjects will not complain, the media is horribly thin-skinned and vengeance-seeking when on the receiving end of criticism.''' ,'''We encourage China to engage as a good global citizen and we are clear-eyed about where differences do lie.''' ,'''The genius of 'Game of Thrones' is that in this rich imagining of a world redolent of the medieval, the rules of a Middle Ages morality play have been so thoroughly discarded.''' ,'''If G20 leaders are serious about sustainable growth and job creation and want to stem migration flows and promote long-term stability, education is an essential investment.''' ,'''Through hard work and education, we can deliver a strong economy and opportunity for all.''' ,'''Being beyond politics, I am able to examine the role of the media without worrying about the indignant harrumphing that emanates from many journalists and commentators when you do so.''' ,'''I want you to know what I have told Australia's Parliament in Canberra - what I told General Petraeus in Kabul - what I told President Obama in the Oval Office this week. Australia will stand firm with our ally the United States.''' ,'''The global economic outlook remains fragile and uncertain. Global economic imbalances persist and we must address them or risk future instability.''' ,'''As more girls get basic schooling, larger numbers will move up the educational ladder - some to pursue science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. That's important because workplaces around the world, especially in many developing and emerging-market countries, are becoming more automated, favouring workers with technical skills.''' ,'''One thing 'Game of Thrones' has taught us all is to guard against too much emotional investment.''' ,'''Education's net economic benefits are greater than many other investments.''' ,'''In fragile and conflict-affected states, education can insulate children from chaos and insecurity and better prepare them to bring about future stability.''' ,'''I first felt the addictive power of 'Game of Thrones' when I was prime minister, living in a world where power was also pursued relentlessly, albeit far less colourfully. Certainly, the characters of my world were nowhere near as good looking or exotically dressed.''' ,''''Game of Thrones' has never much concerned itself with shining a torch on the powerless. Their hunger and suffering in a land ravaged by war is of little concern to the story's most powerful characters, whose antics bring so much pain to the people.''' ,'''America has always understood this principle of the economy - that everyone can benefit when everyone competes.''' ,'''Investing in better-quality education outcomes - especially in maths and science - more than pays for itself.''' ,'''Middle-income countries need to attend to the education of their poorest people to build their economies and ensure long-term stability.''' ,'''A literate, skilled workforce is essential for low-income countries to attract investment and fill jobs with local rather than imported labour.''' ,'''Here in Australia we do get impacted by global economic events. But we should have some confidence that our economy has got strong underlying fundamentals.''' ,'''Getting more girls a good education requires an approach that harnesses the collective efforts of developing nations, donor nations, multilateral organizations, NGOs, private-sector institutions.''' ,'''Educating the world's poorest girls can only be done with the firm commitment of many stakeholders - both domestic and international - to plan, fund, and build strong, sustainable, and equitable education systems.''' ,'''There is a reason the world always looks to America.''' ,'''Our future growth relies on competitiveness and innovation, skills and productivity... and these in turn rely on the education of our people.''' ,'''I have travelled enough internationally to know and accept the reality that, overwhelmingly, people are well disposed to Australia but in truth know very little about it. In particular, people know hardly anything about Australian politics.''' ,'''My earliest political memory is of attending, in 1975, a tub-thumping campaign rally with my father in Adelaide.''' ,'''When I governed, the overwhelming mindset of the media was to dismiss out of hand any suggestion that anything happening to me was in any way related to gender.''' ,'''Economic growth driven by large-scale infrastructure investments without equitable provision of education will leave hundreds of millions of people behind, exacerbating inequality, disillusion, and instability.''' ,'''As prime minister, I was conscious of walking in Whitlam's footsteps as our government set about creating a companion to Medicare, the National Disability Insurance Scheme.''' ,'''Education equals economic growth.''' ,'''I know people are looking at what's happening in Washington and then they also look at events in Europe, in Greece and Portugal and other places and worry about that.''' ,'''Developing countries need to commit additional resources and have the political will to improve education.''' ,'''We know that literate people are more likely than others to participate in their societies' democratic institutions and that the risk of war drops as more of a country's citizens receive a secondary education.''' ,'''Afghanistan must never again be a safe haven for terrorism.''' ,'''Whether or not you welcome it, moving house requires you to make choices about the past as you move into the future. What of all of your bits of stuff is truly valued? What should be left behind?''' ,'''My guiding principle is that prosperity can be shared. We can create wealth together. The global economy is not a zero-sum game.''' ,'''Those of you who have spent time with Australians know that we are not given to overstatement. By nature we are laconic speakers and by conviction we are realistic thinkers.''' ,'''If you believe, as I do, that merit is equally distributed between the sexes, then any result that isn't around half and half should be troubling.''' ,]
