- Oh, I'll be forgotten too, don't worry.
- If you told me tomorrow that I couldn't act anymore, it wouldn't bother me. I have only one wish: to meet the man of my life.

- I'm not even aware of my success. Success is such an illusion.
- I believe that being an actress or being involved in a movie has to be a life experience, otherwise why go for it? I have to change me, and I have to learn things, and I have to push me and my limits. By acting, I find a freedom inside of a prison in a way.
- But I've never felt that being an actress is being in a comfortable place. It's seen from the outside that we're being driven in big cars and having these gorgeous suites and all of that. But come on, it's not about that.

- I don't believe in coincidence.

- Acting is like peeling an onion. You have to peel away each layer to reveal another.
- I've been changed watching films or reading books or hearing music, and that helps you to live your life.

- In a building with apartments, of course, you want to make connections. Life is easier that way. There's salt if you don't have salt; you can knock at someone's door, like in any city. But you know, you can hear the others, and you want to sleep, you get annoyed.
- I don't like films giving me answers. I like films that are provoking me, that are making me feel not only being in an easy place.
- I would have loved to have met Marilyn Monroe and have dinner with her.

- Some words, you know, it's amazing but some words would come only in French, and when I speak French, it would only come in English. And so the adjustment is very difficult sometimes.

- People think actors have such glamorous lives, but the truth is actors go where nobody wants to go.
- I like travelling and if I have to come to Hollywood to make a movie I will, but otherwise I'd never move there. It's very much an industry town and that doesn't really interest me.

- I'm very down-to-earth and accessible, I think.

- I am not a woman staying at home.
- But I think it's a little different in Europe, because 40 is really the best age for a woman. That's when we hit our peak and become this ripe fruit.
- My private life is very private, and I have chosen not to live in America or England, where you are so exposed and can't fight against it.
- I like intensity. If it's too mellow, I feel like, bleah. I like intensity, because it's way of reaching spaces inside of you, and it's my need of knowledge, of knowing about myself regardless.

- But, you know, when I choose a film I need to believe in it and believe I can do something special with it, and after a while that means not trying to judge or analyze why I should do it. You have to follow this intuition thing, which is a mystery to me.
- It's not a struggle to be on a diet. You feel lighter, and your spirit is lighter, too. But I love chocolate, and I allow myself to have chocolate. That doesn't go against a diet for me.

- When I won the Oscar, there was something telling me 'this isn't the truth'. I had to get back to real work.
- Choosing to be in the theatre was a way to put my roots down somewhere with other people. It was a way to choose a new family.
- I've never thought of my characters as being sad. On the contrary, they are full of life. They didn't choose tragedy. Tragedy chose them.
- Acting is a tough business, and you need to be in good shape mentally and physically.
- Sometimes I call directors. Sometimes I just meet with them. It just happens. It's not that I'm pushy. It comes naturally. But I go ahead. I don't stay in my armchair, waiting for the phone to ring.
- I live for the present always. I accept this risk. I don't deny the past, but it's a page to turn.

- I never really worked in Hollywood. Some American producers came to Europe to shoot films with me, so it's a different situation... It was not my aim.
