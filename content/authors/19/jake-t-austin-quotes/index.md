- I'm pretty versatile. I'm able to adapt to an environment and the way I view things based on who I'm with.
- I was born and raised in New York, so I was blessed - or some say cursed - with a strong New York accent.
- It's important to have a fallback and other activities that keep you interested. I started acting when I was about nine or 10 years old. My father was a midtown firefighter so I always wanted to be a firefighter, but then acting came along. I have to have a plan B.
- I think everyone sings in the shower.
- My best feature would have to be my hair. That sounds so cliche - but my hair is like a separate entity.
- With voice over work, you need to convey as much emotion as you can without making any physical movements, so it's hard. You've got to visualize everything.
- I've never been innocent, but I don't think I'm a bad kid! I didn't get voted prom king. I was kind of the dancer, the performer, but I was always very athletic, too.
- I have to at least get a couple weekends in where I can just be on Santa Monica beach or Malibu and just ride the waves.
- 'The Glass Menagerie' by Tennessee Williams is a great play. I had to read it for school when I was younger, but I started writing scripts after that. That's what got me into writing.
- Having constant supporters and people who are always there and always giving back and knowing that they're loving what you're doing is always awesome to see.
