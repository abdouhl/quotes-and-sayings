- Our goal, simply stated, is to be the best.
- Most of our so-called reasoning consists in finding arguments for going on believing as we already do.
- Partisanship is our great curse. We too readily assume that everything has two sides and that it is our duty to be on one or the other.
- Greatness, in the last analysis, is largely bravery - courage in escaping from old ideas and old standards and respectable ways of doing things.
- There are pastors who won't go to people's sick beds. How can people of God turn their back on the sick, poor and hungry?
- Curiosity is idle only to those who fail to realize that it may be a very rare and indispensable thing.
- We find it hard to believe that other people's thoughts are as silly as our own, but they probably are.
