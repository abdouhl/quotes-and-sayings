Both my parents were market traders and worked seven days a week.''' ,'''I'm not into high literature, but I think all my books are literate.''' ,'''For me, a good friend is someone you might only see once or twice a year but each time it feels as though you've just seen them last week.''' ,'''I've always suffered from being labelled a horror writer - just because I didn't go to university, just because I still talk in my natural voice, just because I'm not as articulate as Martin Amis.''' ,'''I've actually seen a ghost, so I know they're really around.''' ,'''I'm terrible in the mornings, but I'm always at my desk by 10 A.M.''' ,'''I never plan my novels because if I know what is going to happen, it bores me rigid. I let the story tell itself.''' ,'''I hate violence, and I didn't plan to write horror; it just poured out of me.''' ,'''I'm very cagey about making friends, and I rarely do.''' ,'''I have a dread of sounding pretentious and try not to talk too much about what I do.''' ,'''I worry about the many things that could happen to the people I love.''' ,'''I've always loved comic books. As a kid, I used to read cowboy stories and historical comics about other worlds, unknown places that would take me out of myself and which helped to develop my imagination.''' ,]
