quotes = ['''The war begins to make itself felt very near to us.''' ,'''No one supposes that the government of the United States is supreme, beyond the sphere plainly defined by the constitution: Neither does any one deny that the State is supreme within its proper sphere of action.''' ,'''South Carolina is too small for a republic and too large for an insane asylum.''' ,'''The allegiance of the citizen, in the only sense in which the word can be tolerated in a republic, is due to the law.
