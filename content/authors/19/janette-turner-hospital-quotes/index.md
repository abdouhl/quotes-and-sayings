quotes = ['''We inherit plots. There are only two or three in the world, five or six at most. We ride them like treadmills.''' ,'''There are all kinds of under-represented groups in the literary establishment.''' ,'''The act of writing surprises me all the time. A miraculous thing happens when you have an idea and you want to convert it into words... and then you start to create a work of art, and that's another miracle, and it remains mysterious to the writer, or to this writer anyway.''' ,'''All of my writing career is about how human beings negotiate dark matter.''' ,'''I am extremely interested in how people negotiate catastrophe, not because I'm morbidly interested in it but because I'm interested in the secret of resilience; that's what I'm always exploring in the stories and the novels.''' ,]
