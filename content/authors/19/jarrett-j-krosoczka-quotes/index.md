quotes = ['''Now when I was a teenager, I was angsty as any teenager was, but after 17 years of having a mother who was in and out of my life like a yo-yo and a father who was faceless, I was angry.''' ,'''It is an awfully sad misconception that librarians simply check books in and out. The library is the heart of a school, and without a librarian, it is but an empty shell.''' ,'''I was raised by my grandparents, and they always made sure that I had a pencil and some paper, whether we were in the car or at a restaurant. While they were enjoying a nice meal, I would be sitting there drawing funny pictures of the waitress.''' ,'''Every single item that we come into contact with on a daily basis has been designed by an artist. From the toothbrush we use in the morning, to the defibrillator that could save our lives, an artist is behind the design.''' ,'''When I was a kid... if I couldn't get a ride to the comic book store, I would walk a mile and a half each way to get the latest issues of 'Batman' and 'Spider-Man' and 'X-Men.'

When she was in jail, we'd write letters back and forth; that was pretty much the only form of communication we had.''' ,'''My name is Jarrett Krosoczka, and I write and illustrate books for children for a living. So I use my imagination as my full-time job.''' ,'''On my 14th birthday, my grandfather and my grandmother gave me the best birthday present ever: a drafting table that I have worked on ever since.''' ,'''Librarians are teaching the next generation how to use digital media responsibly.''' ,'''You never know when your ideas are going to come back to you.''' ,'''As somebody who visits countless schools, I see firsthand the dire situation our educational system faces.''' ,'''What's funny is that an old Web site of mine just had one fake bio, and everyone went crazy for it. So when I made the new Web site, I thought, 'I just need to make this one even more absurd.'''' ,]
