- I hate my hair! When clean, it is fuzzy, and when not clean, it is lank.
- As a teenager, I was teased at school about my height and long legs, but now they are my best assets. Kids can be mean. When I was at school, I considered myself ugly, but that was when I was silly enough to believe that what other people thought mattered. Now I think I am pretty. I'm not beautiful. There is a difference.
- My husband says he wants to have the best hay field in Britain. I can't wait.
- I love 'Saturday Live' with Fi Glover. I find that very relaxing.
- I used to be frightened of the countryside after dark. Now I enjoy it. There is something wonderful about those strange country and wildlife noises.
- I've known my best friend since I was a baby, and I don't know what I would do without her. She is always straight with me and can make me laugh hysterically. Everyone should have someone like that in their life.
- As a model, I travel non-stop.
- Books have always been an important part of my life.
- Because I was very big and she was very small, my mother had a horrible birth when I was born. So she always said: 'I'm never having any more kids!'
- People have always assumed that I am privileged. And that has been a problem sometimes. When I first started modelling, and I was schlepping around London with no money, I found it rather irksome that people thought I had a private income when I didn't.
- My husband is experimental, loves to cook, and is really good at it. If I do the cooking, I lose my appetite. Why is that?
- I knew nothing about my mum's family. Her parents were dead by the time she was 14. She was brought up by two aunts, and she only ever met one uncle.
- Drugs seem to turn people into paranoid bores. Why would anyone want to go there?
- I always dreamt that I would marry in the Piazza Del Campo in Siena and go on my honeymoon down the Amazon, up the Nile, on a gallop through the pyramids, to Nepal and Kerala, on a safari and finally to Lake Titicaca in Peru.
- My face hasn't matured as I've grown up, and neither has my sense of humour. In the mirror, I see an older version of myself as a child, although I do have more wrinkles and freckles.
- I have my father to thank for my build and height, and my mother to thank for my lips and eyes.
- Mum and I were delighted to find out we were descended from 'bog-trotters.'
- I was very lucky growing up, and I got all my dad's and aunts' toys from the 1950s and 1960s and loved those old pedal cars.
- When I had my kids, I took a lot of homeopathic things, and I had them both with no painkillers.
- I try not to wear too much makeup, as I think there comes a point where too much makes you look older.
- I want to do something to help people.
- People talk about me as if I am the sole inheritor of the Guinness family fortune and worth masses, but I have hundreds of cousins.
- Men are definitely getting more avant-garde, experimenting with colours, patterns and fabrics.
- Since having kids, I am more careful about saving rather than splurging. I used to spend all my money on trainers and high heels that I couldn't walk in.
- It's really hard work being a model.
- I'm a total technophobe. What is wrong with paper and pen? I was delighted when I learnt the word 'Luddite,' as I thought it described me perfectly.
- Be kind, don't judge, and have respect for others. If we can all do this, the world would be a better place. The point is to teach this to the next generation.
- In my twenties, I was obsessed with what other people thought of me. In my thirties, it's about my children, my husband, my work. In my forties, it's going to be about me, and I shan't care what anyone else thinks. I can't wait!
- I've worked since I was 18. I have no trust fund and don't expect anything.
- We have too many poisons in our diets now, like sugar and caffeine.
- It has long been a childhood dream of mine to have a farm.
- I'd never go under the knife because I have a phobia of needles.
- I always dress scruffily, but at weekends I live in muddy Wellies.
- I once stayed in a roach-infested hotel in Istanbul for a work trip. I had to share my room with a male model, and pointedly all we talked about was our other halves.
- Yes, I was on the cover of 'Vogue,' but girls on the cover of 'Vogue' are the most scared of rejection. Models are the most insecure of them all. Actually, actors and actresses are, and then musicians, and then models!
- I grew up in Ireland, so I do not have a lot of respect for most politicians.
- I have always loved clothes, and the opportunity to design my own line could not be missed. It's a dream job.
- I spent a day in a neck brace on a hospital trolley after falling from a horse and cart in Ireland. All the nurses thought I was a traveler, which made me laugh. Who else comes into a hospital saying they've fallen off a horse and cart?
- Being mum is a number one job. That takes priority.
- We've got to make greedy banks pass on interest rate cuts in full, and we've got to see rents coming down.
- People tend to assume that I come from a long line of castle-dwelling gentry and am made of money.
- I think children of divorced parents do grow up quicker. You just do.
- Arnica is great. I got kicked in the stomach by a horse once, and some adult slapped arnica all over it, and I had no bruise at all to show for my pain.
- The government has got to do something to help independent businesses.
- People who read on holiday always have a better time because it's total escapism, both physically and mentally.
- It was tough going to boarding school. It was very hard work.
- I don't believe in diets, as I always put whatever I lost right back on again. I think we should all just eat healthily and get as much exercise as we can.
- It's appalling how much money raised at some charity events gets wasted on paying personnel and admin staff.
- While farmers' markets are booming in cities, actual rural market towns are in decline.
- It's all very well setting up your own brand of face cream or exercise wear - but Christ, it's so shallow.
