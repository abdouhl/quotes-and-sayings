Why think! We have computers to do that for us.''' ,'''The ideal, without doubt, varies, but its enemies, alas, are always the same.''' ,'''A married couple are well suited when both partners usually feel the need for a quarrel at the same time.''' ,'''Truth is always served by great minds, even if they fight it.''' ,'''We spend our time envying people whom we wouldn't wish to be.''' ,'''Renown? I've already got more of it than those I respect, and will never have as much as those for whom I feel contempt.''' ,'''In order to remain true to oneself one ought to renounce one's party three times a day.''' ,'''To love an idea is to love it a little more than one should.''' ,'''One kills a man, one is an assassin; one kills millions, one is a conqueror; one kills everybody, one is a god.''' ,'''I should have no use for a paradise in which I should be deprived of the right to prefer hell.''' ,'''The least one can say of power is that a vocation for it is suspicious.''' ,'''I still understand a few words in life, but I no longer think they make a sentence.''' ,'''It is not easy to imagine how little interested a scientist usually is in the work of any other, with the possible exception of the teacher who backs him or the student who honors him.''' ,'''Hatred, for the man who is not engaged in it, is a little like the odor of garlic for one who hasn't eaten any.''' ,'''To reflect is to disturb one's thoughts.''' ,'''Nothing leads the scientist so astray as a premature truth.''' ,'''Greatness, in order to gain recognition, must all too often consent to ape greatness.''' ,'''It is sometimes well for a blatant error to draw attention to overmodest truths.''' ,'''The nobility of a human being is strictly independent of that of his convictions.''' ,'''In politics, yesterday's lie is attacked only to flatter today's.''' ,'''I prefer the honest jargon of reality to the outright lies of books.''' ,'''My pessimism extends to the point of even suspecting the sincerity of other pessimists.''' ,'''The divine is perhaps that quality in man which permits him to endure the lack of God.''' ,'''God, that dumping ground of our dreams.''' ,'''A body of work such as Pasteur's is inconceivable in our time: no man would be given a chance to create a whole science. Nowadays a path is scarcely opened up when the crowd begins to pour in.''' ,'''One must credit an hypothesis with all that has had to be discovered in order to demolish it.''' ,'''The books one has written in the past have two surprises in store: one couldn't write them again, and wouldn't want to.''' ,'''I don't judge a regime by the damning criticism of the opposition, but by the ingenuous praise of the partisan.''' ,'''We must watch over our modesty in the presence of those who cannot understand its grounds.''' ,]
