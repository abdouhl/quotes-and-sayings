- Democracy not only requires equality but also an unshakable conviction in the value of each person, who is then equal.
- I always assume that democracy is the only good form of government, quite frankly, and democracy is always to be preferred.
- I think that there is absolutely no free market in modern industrial states.
- We have war when at least one of the parties to a conflict wants something more than it wants peace.
- What takes place in the Security Council more closely resembles a mugging than either a political debate or an effort at problem-solving.
- That is simply that Marxism has been tremendously fashionable in our time, so it has infected a very large number of major institutions in many countries of the world. So I suppose that we shouldn't be too surprised that it should infect the church as well.
- I conclude that it is a fundamental mistake to think that salvation, justice, or virtue come through merely human institutions.
- And I think detente had manifestly failed, and that the pursuit of it was encouraging Soviet expansion and rendering the world more dangerous, and especially rendering the Western world in greater peril.

- Solidarity was the movement that turned the direction of history, I think.

- The real point is that totalitarian regimes have claimed jurisdiction over the whole person, and the whole society, and they don't at all believe that we should give unto Caesar that which is Caesar's and unto God that which is God's.
- Truth, which is important to a scholar, has got to be concrete. And there is nothing more concrete than dealing with babies, burps and bottles, frogs and mud.
- Just as the Russians and the Soviets didn't manage to wipe out languages in Lithuania, neither have they managed to wipe out religion to the extent that we had feared.
- In the years just before... during the Carter years, the Soviets regularly violated, if you will, both the spirit and theletter of arms control agreements, I think, that they had negotiated during the period of detente.
- I'm a political scientist and I study these things, and I know that economic problems, with the rising unemployment and inflation and low productivity and so forth, were a factor in that election, in that defeat of President Carter.
