- When you inherit a franchise that won one playoff game in the last 10 years, you've inherited a troubled franchise.
- As an owner, you have a choice. Do you want to adopt a vision that you think is real sharp and real cutting edge and could get you from good to great - has a chance - or do you want to just say the organization is not about that, and we're not going to try to adopt a new coaching philosophy and vision.
- I think at the end of season you really learn exactly how you might become better.
- The better quarterbacks are real consistent. Rookie quarterbacks are not.
- You have heard me say many times that I want strong leaders who feel free to express their opinions.
- You can always argue you're never good enough until you win the Super Bowl. And even then, you're going to lose players, and you're not good enough then, either.
- You never want to plateau out. Getting better every day is my expectation.
- The owner always has the final say. You have to decide who is going to be the best fit for the organization.
- I'm an owner that tends to absolutely be supportive of a coach and his vision if it's a real sharp and smart vision. I really believe in that.
- I've lived through a lot of division championships, a lot of final-four appearances, but our goal is further than that. We want to deliver a Super Bowl.
- What we do at the end of every season - which is why it's probably not the greatest idea to talk about things in the visitor's locker room after the final game - we sit down and have real serious conversations with all of the senior people.
- The only model to me that correlates with big success in the NFL is having a Hall of Fame franchise quarterback.
- I don't really worry about the weather... as long as you have good access to the stadium, that's the one thing you worry about.
- If I were to describe myself as any particular type of owner, it would be a fans' owner because you really get great satisfaction when you can go out on the streets and scream you're No. 1 and you're world champions.
- In the normal process of evaluating the end of the season, I meet with key executives for thorough discussions and evaluations of all aspects of football operations.
- Other than my family and my close friends, there's nothing I love more than owning the team and doing everything I can to make it a success. That's how I live. That is me.
- I think when you have strong leadership at the coaching level and you empower the coach and the coaching staff, you have a lot more stability.
- You notice it with any organization that's had a lot of success: you will start to reach thinking, 'That's the player, that's the method, that's the mechanism, that's the coach, that's the thing that's going to put us over the top.'
- If you had to point to anything, it's when you've had as much success as we've had and are so close to winning a Super Bowl, at some stage you have an opportunity to think the next move, even if it's not consistent with all your previous moves, will be the one that gives you the chance to win the Lombardi Trophy.
- If you can have a really good coaching staff, and you can have a really good young quarterback and do a really good job in player personnel and string together multiple successful drafts, your window is not small in the NFL because of the quarterback.
- To be better than 31 other teams, you better be a really good team. It's just not about one person.
- The head coach is the chemist.
