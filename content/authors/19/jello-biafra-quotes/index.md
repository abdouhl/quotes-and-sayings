quotes = ['''The jury had down right contempt for punk rock grass roots ethics.''' ,'''I've been to enough other countries in the world to know what happens when you have socialized single-payer health care. It works. People don't get sick as much. They don't lose their life savings with a catastrophic illness like cancer or AIDS.''' ,'''I don't think it's too hippie to want to clean up the planet so you don't wind up dying of some kind of cancer when you're 45 years old. It enrages me that these big cancer-research organizations can't be bothered to man the front lines of environmental protest.''' ,'''Once you get involved with bloodsport litigation, you can not only get drunk on your own greed but start to believe your own lies.''' ,'''All of these reissues were not authorized by me, I do not endorse them, the live album was put out without my permission, and I've not seen a dime at this point, either.''' ,'''I have very mixed feelings about Jesse Jackson. He's very good about labor, and human and civil rights issues, but not so good on cultural issues.''' ,'''For every prohibition you create, you also create an underground.''' ,'''That's the way both they and I travel sometimes. Pick road at random, and when it's time to pull over, you pull over and hope you can find a place to crash.''' ,'''What they're not doing is marketing the Dead Kennedys in the spirit of what the band stood for.''' ,'''I didn't really start writing music or lyrics or turning them into songs until I went to San Francisco.''' ,'''There's sort of an open offer to work with a guy in Los Angeles who does big band and orchestra arrangements who was at least an acquaintance to Les Baxter before he passed away.''' ,'''Hardly anybody in America pays attention to local elections.''' ,'''What I'm getting at is, you know, if we really want to get serious about helping all the people living in the street and getting people jobs, we could just hire half the people in the country to spy on the other half.''' ,'''If I go without rock for too long, I feel depressed.''' ,'''We didn't have money to put out everything we wanted to put out.''' ,'''You can spend the money on new housing for poor people and the homeless, or you can spend it on a football stadium or a golf course.''' ,'''Punk was originally about creating new, important, energetic music that would hopefully threaten the status quo and the stupidity of the 1970s.''' ,'''Then as I got older, I always gravitated towards the hard stuff, Born To Be Wild, then Black Sabbath.''' ,'''Let me start by saying, I'm utterly disgusted with the former members of the Dead Kennedys.''' ,'''They've gone to great length to disguise the fact that I'm not in the band, even sending out a photo to promoters with my picture in it which then winds up in some of the ads on the flyers.''' ,'''Don't hate the media, become the media.''' ,'''Punk is not dead. Punk will only die when corporations can exploit and mass produce it.''' ,'''The Sonics I found later and that was pretty important.''' ,'''This is my home. Home is where the disease is. As long as I stay in America, I'll never run out of subjects for songs.''' ,'''If you love god, burn a church.''' ,'''If evolution is outlawed, only outlaws will evolve.''' ,'''Especially in local elections, because hardly anybody pays attention to those - but it's really important who's mayor and who's on the city council, county commissioners, sheriffs, district attorney, and of course the school board.''' ,'''If I get even five per cent of my ideas out and documented before I die, I'll be lucky. I'm not in danger of running out of riffs or ideas anytime soon. They overwhelm me and it's hard to find time to deal with them.''' ,'''I think that what's perceived as punk out in shopping malls or in chain stores or on MTV has almost nothing to do with what punk is about.''' ,'''No matter what I do, my songs come out in a certain style, and if that sounds like Dead Kennedys, then there's probably a reason for it. Don't forget, I wrote most of those songs, music and lyrics.''' ,'''I've never been a big fan of subtle art. I like art that gets deep into my head and starts my brain spinning with new ideas and inspiration and my whole body is full of energy.''' ,'''You have to be down here in the States to realize just how tightly controlled the corporate media is and how much they practise Soviet-style censorship through creative omission.''' ,'''Any alternative culture that inspires a lot of passion and inspiration is also in danger of being set in its ways, almost from the moment it's born.''' ,'''Respecting other people's cultures is well and good, but I draw the line at where some branches of Islam, what they do to women. It's indefensible.''' ,'''I'm totally down with insurrection in the street. I've had a great time with that over the years. Insurrection in the voting booth is the other part of the equation.''' ,'''I got involved because I wanted to help inspire more people to get off their butts and register and vote - not just in this election, but in every other election from now on, you know?''' ,'''You've got to have an ego as big as Mars to want to think that you, of all people, are better than anyone else to be president of the United States. People that vain, they want their place in history, and they want to be able to control how much they'll be worshipped by future generations.''' ,'''The last true punk band to get a major label contract was The Dickies.''' ,'''It depends on the situation. I mean, on one hand there's the argument that people should be left alone on the other hand, there's the argument to wade in a stop slaughters in places like Bosnia and Kosovo and what we probably should have done in Rwanda.''' ,'''My parents didn't hide reality. I watched cartoons and the news with equal fascination.''' ,'''I do fear for the generations of people who came of age thinking that pop-punk is what punk is, and that all the rebellion you need is just to stick your tongue out in the mirror every once in a while.''' ,'''I went through a big Alice Cooper phase, which was probably a major influence on my writing style later, especially after Plastic Surgery Disasters.''' ,'''Well, I don't think I'll ever stop being frustrated or feel fulfilled artistically.''' ,'''So basically the understanding on these so-called reissues is that they were done behind my back, without my permission, and the band informed me that I would no longer be paid on them at all.''' ,'''I think one of the most important things punk brought back was the whole concept of staying independent and doing things yourself. It made music a lot less boring in any category you can name.''' ,'''When there's people on the other side of the room trying to wipe out your life and things are stacked against you, you can get nervous.''' ,'''I think Noam Chomsky is a national treasure - make that an international treasure.''' ,]
