- I love food - all kinds of food, and I feel like I am never full. Sushi is my favorite if I had to pick.

- I'm really focused on continuing to make pieces that you can wear forever and with all the other things that you love.
- I'm just as content sitting on the floor playing Barbies with my kids as I am having a glass of wine with my girlfriends.
- You know, my company is my company. My dad didn't help me, and I didn't get money from my family. I have the most supportive family and they would give me anything, but I always thought that I wanted to do something on my own and prove myself on my own for sure.
- I would love to be that woman in a scarf and large glasses pretending I'm in a Fellini movie, but that's just not my reality.
- I wanted to design pieces that you wore all the time.
- I'm really inspired by my friends and the way they layer their jewelry with classic pieces as well as with my pieces.
- I knew what I wanted to wear and I couldn't find it: I wanted that delicate jewelry that you never took off, that you showered in, that you slept in.

- I had worked in PR for Giorgio Armani and Ralph Lauren and I always wanted to do something in design - and I really wanted to do jewelry.
- For me, jewelry is a true investment. It's sentimental and it's meaningful.
- My grandma, Edith, was one of the greatest inspirations in my life, both personally and professionally. She was an incredibly talented artist who shared her creativity with me from a young age and was a driving force in the launch of my jewelry line.
- My grandmother was an artist and did enameling. She had a little apartment, and in her tiny little kitchen, she had a kiln. We used to sit there when I was six years old and she'd let me choose the colors and bake the pieces and create a necklace, or a ring, or a little piece of art.
- When COVID-19 first hit, we thought everyone could use a little luck and created a hoodie for a few friends with our signature good luck motif. We were blown away by the social media response and now the sweatshirts regularly sell out on our website.
- As a designer, you always dream of having your own store where you can showcase your full collection and how it all looks together.
- We have two kids, so it's a busy house. I want a place where the kids feel comfortable and like they can really live. I'm attracted to clean and modern but also feeling like you can plop yourself onto a couch and cuddle up.
- I was born and raised in L.A. I'm a L.A. girl. I love the quietness of L.A. and that you can just keep your head down and work.
- I was born in '77 and the '90s was really when I started expressing myself in fashion.
- I've never had a time where I didn't want to do my jewelry anymore. Once I started it, and once I realized I was really doing something I loved, I gave it my heart. When we first started the company, I did it all myself in our living room.
- I design for the inspiring, stylish women I meet every day. I try not to look around or be distracted by what other people are creating. I make jewelry that I want to keep for years to come and I really love what I do!
