- My father spent all those years building his brand. I happen to be his namesake, and I also happen to be the president of the largest Christian university.

- As the president of a university community of nearly 15,000 students and 7,000 faculty and staff, I take very seriously my responsibility to keep our campus safe in an increasingly dangerous world. The concealed carry policy has worked well for us.

- Jesus taught that we should give to the poor and support widows, but he never said that we should elect a government that would take money from our neighbor's hand and give it to the poor.

- Wouldn't it be something if Liberty's votes were enough to change which presidential candidate won Virginia and maybe even the presidency itself?
- Matthew 7:16 tells us that by their fruits you shall know them. Donald Trump's life has borne fruit, fruit that has provided jobs to multitudes of people in addition to the many he has helped with his generosity.

- A university is supposed to be a place where all ideas are discussed.
- I think that Gov. Huckabee is one of us. I know that a lot of the other candidates try to talk like evangelicals, but he's actually one of us. He believes like we do on all the issues, which energizes me as a voter.

- I believe we all have the right as private citizens to endorse candidates and participate in the political process.
- It was funny that rank-and-file evangelicals were ahead of all the leadership. They saw for decades conservative Republicans had made promises to them on issues that were important to Christians and conservatives when they were running for office. But when they won, they didn't keep those promises.
- I really believe that anybody on the Left or the Right that tries to invoke the teachings of Jesus to say they should vote for this candidate or that candidate, I think they're stretching Scripture.
- You have to hear from people who believe something different from you. That's why you go to college.
