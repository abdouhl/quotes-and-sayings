quotes = ['''Because of the wonderfully positive response to 'Life's That Way,' I am considering writing some more autobiographical stuff - maybe another book. I don't know. It doesn't help that I'm lazy.''' ,'''I welcome every chance I get to interact with fans. I've made some very close friendships amongst fans, and I look forward to seeing them.''' ,'''I've got a lot of shows under my belt that are ancient history solely because they were on the air before this video revolution came along and ensured that canceled shows could continue to have a bit of a presence.''' ,''''Deadwood' proved that viewers are smarter in terms of grasping intricate dialogue than they had been given credit for.''' ,'''Obviously I struck gold with 'Deadwood.' No pun intended.''' ,'''After appearing for eight seasons as a beloved character on 'Supernatural,' it's not surprising that I get most of my recognition on the street from that, and it happens with some frequency. But I'm not a guy who gets recognized often.''' ,'''I thought being in the wheelchair might be kind of limiting for me as an actor. It turned out cool in a lot of ways. Of course, at the end of the day, I can get up out of the chair and go home, but I'm very acutely aware that most people can't, so I try to give the situation that depth.''' ,'''More and more, I've started to understand that no show is dead unless somebody decrees it's dead at a studio.''' ,'''I've done a bunch of jobs since 'Deadwood' went off the air, but it's always been a very high bar that those other shows have to live up to.''' ,''''Life's That Way' was an extraordinarily difficult book to write, because it wasn't written as a book. It was written as a journal of events that were happening as I wrote it, without the space or time either to digest or analyze those events and without the hindsight and peace that writing in the aftermath would have provided.''' ,''''Deadwood' was a magical experience. It was an absolute culmination of everything I've ever wanted to do as an actor as an artist, and I was enormously proud to have been involved with it.''' ,'''I've been incredibly blessed with good roles the past few years, but none of them compares to the experience of playing Ellsworth on 'Deadwood.' There are times when I've had as much fun or had comparably great material, but as a body of work, playing Ellsworth tops anything else in my lifetime.''' ,'''I was very unhappy about being killed off on 'Supernatural' in season 7.''' ,'''When I was a kid, the high point of the day was to go to the mailbox and see if any mail came for me, and I'm still stuck in that mode.''' ,'''Drama is about conflict, and it's about putting obstacles in the path of people you who care about.''' ,'''I miss the cast and crew of 'Supernatural' immensely. I know it's a cliche to say your cast and crew are like your family, but it's really the case there.''' ,'''When you're not the lead on a series, you work intermittently, even if you're in every episode.''' ,'''My wife Cecily Adams was dying of cancer, my daughter Madeline was struggling to overcome an autism diagnosis, and my father was dying, all at the same time. Writing the journal was a cathartic experience, and an extremely positive one.''' ,'''I've got no ego; I just like to have thousands of people write to me and tell me how wonderful I am.''' ,]
