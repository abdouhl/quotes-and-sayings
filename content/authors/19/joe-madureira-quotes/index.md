- Everyone loves characters that are relatable or who have unique quirks or tragic flaws.
- After being in a studio, working on games stuff, I'm like, 'Oh my God, I wish I could just sit in my room for a week and listen to music and draw by myself.'
- There's a creative freedom to comics, and a fulfillment I get out of panel layouts and storytelling that is hard for me to get anywhere else.
- Having a blank slate is sometimes as daunting as it is exciting.
- Usually when you're doing concepts for a character, you just try a couple different things to see what sticks.
- On a book like 'X-Men,' you have to stay true to the established fiction, working with editors to ensure continuity, sometimes across multiple titles.
- When I drew Captain America in 'The Ultimates,' I hated my Cap, even though some people are like, 'Man, your Cap's cool!' and they made statues out of it.
- I'm sure that no matter what I'm involved in, I'll always be doing comics, at least in some minor capacity.
- It always makes me sad when someone comments on how much they love my work- from 15 years ago! I don't want to be just another old school guy that fell off.
- I like coming up with new characters. Whether it's revamping an old character no one likes or just coming up with brand-new stuff, that's kind of what excited me as an artist.
- Lots of places to hone your skill as an artist and still earn a paycheck while you're waiting to kick the door down.
