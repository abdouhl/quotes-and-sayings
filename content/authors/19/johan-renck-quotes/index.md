- Movies are made for people to pay and go see them.
- Brits are very, very expressive, whereas the Soviet and Eastern European way is much more stern, stone-faced. Vladimir Putin-esque in some way.

- They say don't meet your heroes, but when it comes to Bowie, he truly is the most brilliant person I've ever met.
- I guess I found the life as a musician too counterproductive, as so much time was spent in tour buses & remote hotel rooms. As I am moderately hyperactive, this didn't suit my temper.

- The first time I went behind the camera was in 1993. I felt, 'This is my thing,' and I knew that someday I'd make a feature.
- I grew up all over the world. My dad was a doctor but not a career-type doctor. He was very curious, so he took the whole family and moved to Miami in the '70s, and we lived there for a couple of years. Then we continued like that and lived in various places around the world.
- Whenever I'm making a film, it has to be timeless.

- In many ways, shooting my first feature was more difficult than I had thought it would be, but it was still the most rewarding experience I have ever had.
- In an ideal world, as a director, you usually wish you could do your own thing and not have to take anyone else's point of view into account, but occasionally you work with someone like Robyn, who brings a new set of ideas to the table, and the whole ends up much greater than the sum of the parts.
- When you're young, and you're doing stuff, you're making music, directing, making art, it's all future directed. You want to change stuff onward. And when you get older - this applies to me - you think about the things you want to do and how it will be perceived by your children one day.
