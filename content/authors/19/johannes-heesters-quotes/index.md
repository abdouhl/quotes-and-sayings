- Politics is dirty, and I don't like to talk about dirty things... My conscience is clear.
- Sure, I acted in films in the Third Reich, entertainment films, which distracted countless people inside and outside Germany from daily life during war.

- My secret to a long, healthy life is to always keep working. It keeps me busy and happy and gives me a reason to stay alive.
