- We need it to capture the energy of contemporary life.
- I think the composer and production staff of an opera have a real responsibility to use visual elements of all kinds to make clear to the American audience, at any rate, exactly what is going on.
- However, yes, especially as one gets older, you know, you really hope that your music will become more generally available, even though some of the performances might be riddled with faults.
- I think I was first to do live performances on a modern electronic sound synthesizer.
- I really write for people.
