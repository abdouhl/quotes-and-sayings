- Yeah, certainly you want to try to save your energy at a Grand Slam.
- People often come up and tell me how much money I make in a year, which is funny because I don't think it's something I've ever said to someone.
- It's very important to be rested.
- Practicing hard doesn't guarantee you anything.
- I didn't know I could even be a professional tennis player, honestly. All this is actually very, very unexpected.
- I try to bring a lot of water on the plane with me and eat a really good meal.
- Everything has gone pretty fluidly in my personal life, so I think that certainly helps.
- When I fly overseas, I usually fly business class. If not, my knees are going to be at my chin.
- People think when you're struggling and not winning matches it's because you're not working hard. That's the biggest misnomer in tennis.
- I felt a ton of pressure in '08. A lot of great things were expected of me right out of the gate, and I brought some of that on myself with those great early results. But I wasn't a good enough player to make a run every fourth or fifth tournament. I wasn't as good a player as my ranking indicated.
- The mental part of the game, being able to free up on the tennis court, is much easier said than done.
- There's a lot of times I'll just play too passive and since I'm not going to play defense as well as most guys can, I can't get away with passive play.
- Tennis is not really a traditional Olympic sport.
- I've always stayed hungry.
- A lot of players have had it worse than me. Look at a guy like Andy Roddick, incredible Hall of Fame player, but he ran up against Roger so many times in big finals.
- A lot of times when I'm confident and relaxed on the court, I'm going to be a pretty tough out. But when I'm not so confident and not so relaxed, I tense up and my balls fall short and everything. It just sort of unravels.
- That's why I enjoy Davis Cup, and I really enjoyed college tennis. It's very special. You want to go out there and compete your hardest, because you don't want to let anyone down. You want to absolutely give it your all for your team. And that's sort of the mentality I've taken to pro tennis.

- I stopped eating airplane food; it's not that good.
- I love building a team around me, and being able to support a group of people is one of the best feelings I've come to know during my career; I imagine this is what a lot of business owners can relate to this.
- Up until I was a junior at Georgia, I felt that when all was said and done, I'd at least have a college degree to fall back on when tennis was finished.
- Probably the most infamous story in our family: My oldest brother took a U-lock bike lock and locked my head to the bedpost. And he didn't just do this for a minute or two; he did this for a couple hours. I was maybe 8 or 9, and he was maybe 15.
- I was playing 60, 70 matches a year in college. In the pros, unless you're winning, you're not playing that many.
- I have a coach and I have a chiropractor, who works to keep me healthy. I pay their salaries. I pay for their flights as we travel around the world on a weekly basis, and I pay for their hotels and meals while we're on tour.
- At 19, I didn't have a hair on my face. When I was 20, I looked 14.

- As a tennis player, or any professional athlete, our career has a shelf life. I don't want to waste any opportunities, I don't want to look back on it when I'm 45 and think I could have done a lot more.
- Any time you get to come to New York and be near New York City, that is a very cool opportunity.
- I try not to eat too much, but I always get hungry before a match. I make sure I have enough fuel in my body. I'll eat pasta and a little bit of protein usually. I'm pretty much eating a full meal.
- That's the most fulfilling thing I've experienced ever, being a father.

- I've sort of always pulled for the heels, like the bad guys. So I think if I were a pro wrestler, first I'd need to bulk up, and second I'll need to get sort of a bad-boy persona.
- Nothing against the Olympics. I played in 2012 and it was an incredible experience. It's different for tennis players than for swimmers and track and field athletes. That's the pinnacle of their sport and not so much the pinnacle of tennis.
- Tennis is a funny sport.
- I know where I'm ranked, but I don't look at it that much, I don't study it that much. You really can't look at it that way, you've got to try to win as many matches as you can, and it's cliche, but you've got to take it one at a time.
- I always have to play very aggressive on the court. It's something that's easier said than done.
- When you're out on the court, you're fighting against yourself and it can be tough.
- A tournament pays me to show up because the fans want to see me and I move the needle at the box office? That's amazing. It's good for tennis, good for me and good for the event. If a sponsor wants to pay to put their company name on my shirt because they think I'm a strong ambassador for their brand? Heck yes.
- Being able to travel with family and friends so they can cheer me on as I play is something it's hard to put a price on; my point is simply that for all of this, there is indeed a price.

- In the past, I've played where I only just rely on my serve.
- I grew up in a nice neighborhood in Greensboro, N.C., which is not too big, but definitely not a small town.
- When I travel to a grand slam, I need to look for a place to stay for me, my family and my team.
- I almost went with basketball over tennis.
- The coaches that I have have done an incredible job with me, obviously the stuff we work on on the court.
- The way I see it, the prize money is a reflection of my on-court performance, but the sponsorships are something more personal, connected more to people and fans, and to my values.
- I've learned how to sleep on airplanes. When I'm taking a trans-Atlantic flight or going to a different continent, I will always read because reading puts me to sleep. When you watch a movie, you have all that light coming to your eyes, but with reading, I can't get through 15 or 20 pages.
- Our biggest events are the Grand Slams and are always going to be the Grand Slams.
- My family and friends, they know that I'm a really good competitor.
- People seem to think when you lose a match it's because you are not working hard.
- My theory is that I'm just closer to the sun than everyone else. I weigh more than everyone else, I'm taller than everyone else. When it's really humid and hot outside it's going to take a bigger toll on me.

- My confidence sort of comes and goes very quickly.
- My marriage and my career are my two top priorities.

- As anyone who is a father or mother out there can tell you, it's pretty amazing.
- I always knew that my best tennis was going to be in my late 20s.
- Sometimes I think the easiest way to introduce what goes into managing the expenses of a tennis career is to take a look at another pro sport and notice some of the differences.
- I can't beat guys consistently playing like I'm 5-foot-10.
- When I left college, I just thought I could play tennis to delay getting a regular job and go there and try to make ends meet. But it's been a very different experience for me, fortunately.
- I try not to make a habit of spending the whole year losing in the first rounds of events, but tennis is one of those sports where nothing is guaranteed.
- Davis Cup is a completely different animal.
- A big upper body is not a great thing for tennis, and for me, flexibility is important.
- That would be a huge honor, if I ever were to become the No. 1 American. It's something that I've always wanted to, you know, achieve that. For me, if were to happen, it'd be great. I'd try to hold onto that spot as long as possible, but I know there'd be a lot of people nipping at my heels to try to get to that No. 1 spot.
- I've done a good job putting some meat on my bones since my freshman year of college. It's taken a lot of work. I was just under 200 pounds my freshman year; I was 6'8' and 198 pounds.
- Outdoor tennis plays into my strengths a little better.
- If someone had told me at fourteen that I'd be six-ten, I might have stuck with basketball, in all seriousness.
- There is so much that goes in to being a good tennis player. It's not just what you can do well on the court, it's between the ears as well.
- You're going to lose points and gain points throughout the year.
- My expenses are largely a fixed, sunken cost, regardless of how much revenue I earn.
