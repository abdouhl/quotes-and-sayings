quotes = ['''By one Spirit we are all baptised into one body.''' ,'''Among the children of God, it was they who were most able to rightly divide the word of truth.''' ,'''This truth of the gathering together of God's children is in Scripture seen realised in various localities, and in each central locality the Christians resident therein composed but one body: Scripture is perfectly clear on that head.''' ,'''During my solitude, conflicting thoughts increased; but much exercise of soul had the effect of causing the scriptures to gain complete ascendancy over me.''' ,'''To rest satisfied with existing evils, as if we could do nothing, is not obedience; but neither is it obedience to imitate the actions of the apostles.''' ,'''Let those who like society better have it.''' ,'''The Reformation did not directly touch the question of the true character of God's church.''' ,'''I held apostolic succession fully, and the channels of grace to be there only.''' ,'''I had always owned them to be the Word of God... the careful reading of the Acts afforded me a practical picture of the early church; which made me feel deeply the contrast with its actual present state; though still, as ever beloved by God.''' ,'''Obedience to the word in humility of mind never confuses.''' ,'''Nationalism - in other words, the dividing of the church into bodies - consisting of such and such a nation, is a novelty, not above three centuries old, although many dear children of God are found dwelling in it.''' ,'''After deep exercise of soul I was brought by grace to feel I could entirely.''' ,'''But the more we search the Scriptures, the more we perceive, in this doctrine, the fundamental truth of the gospel - that truth which gives to redemption its character, and to all other truths their real power.''' ,'''Christ preferred the poor; ever since I have been converted so have I.''' ,'''I add, that those who are bent on restoring the whole church ought to be well instructed in the word, and to abstain from doing anything under the pretext of simplicity.''' ,'''The Epistle is a correction of profession without life, and most valuable in this respect.''' ,'''Nothing is more prominently brought forward in the New Testament than the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ.''' ,'''Every Christian will allow that sin is an evil, and that it is our duty not to commit sin.''' ,'''I go farther, and say, that it is plainly our duty to desire pastors and teachers to take the care of such congregations, and that God did raise up such in the church as we see it in the word.''' ,'''Some respected and beloved brethren insist that the forming and organising of churches is, according to God's will, the only means of finding blessing in the midst of that confusion which is acknowledged to exist.''' ,'''The salvation of the elect was as certain before His advent, though accomplished by it, as afterwards.''' ,'''If real churches exist, such persons are not called on to make them.''' ,'''I know that those who esteem these little organised associations to be the churches of God, see nothing but mere meetings of men in every other gathering of God's children.''' ,'''Jude has a very different character. It is not the cradle of Christianity, or of the assembly on earth: it is its decay and its death here below. It does not keep its first estate.''' ,'''The cross is the centre of all this in every respect.''' ,'''The presence of the Holy Spirit is the keystone of all our hopes.''' ,'''It is the desire of our hearts, and as we believe God's will under this dispensation, that all the children of God should be gathered together as such, and, consequently, as not of the world.''' ,'''God is sufficient in all ages for His church.''' ,'''I can say, Christ has been my only object; thank God, my righteousness too... Hold fast to Christ.''' ,]
