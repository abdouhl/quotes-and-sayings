- It is in middles that extremes clash, where ambiguity restlessly rules.
- The lust to meet authors ranks low, I think, on the roll of holy appetites; but it is an authentic pang.

- The good ending dismisses us with a touch of ceremony and throws a backward light of significance over the story just read. It makes it, as they say, or unmakes it.

- There is a great deal of busywork to a writer's life, as to a professor's life, a great deal of work that matters only in that, if you don't do it, your desk becomes very full of papers. So, there is a lot of letter answering and a certain amount of speaking, though I try to keep that at a minimum.

- Religion enables us to ignore nothingness and get on with the jobs of life.

Whereas Christian religion is retreating everywhere and losing more and more influence; film has filled the vacuum and supports us with myths and action-controlling images.

- Four years was enough of Harvard. I still had a lot to learn, but had been given the liberating notion that now I could teach myself.
- I should mention something that nobody ever thinks about, but proofreading takes a lot of time. After you write something, there are these proofs that keep coming, and there's this panicky feeling that 'This is me and I must make it better.'
- The firmest house in my fiction, probably, is the little thick-walled sandstone farmhouse of 'The Centaur' and 'Of the Farm'; I had lived in that house, and can visualize every floorboard and bit of worn molding.

- I think you remember certain phrases from bad reviews. You don't remember all the bad reviews.
- The study of literature threatens to become a kind of paleontology of failure, and criticism a supercilious psychoanalysis of authors.

- If men do not keep on speaking terms with children, they cease to be men, and become merely machines for eating and for earning money.
- It's sort of good to see your vocation as a daily task and have fairly modest expectations for financial or reward in other coin - glory, love, whatever.
- I know more about what it's like to be elderly and infirm and kind of stupid, the way you get forgetful, but on the other hand I'm a littler, wiser, dare we say? The word 'wisdom' has kind of faded out of our vocabulary, but yeah, I'm a little wiser.
- Our artistic heroes tend to be those self-exercisers, like Picasso, and Nabokov, and Wallace Stevens, who rather defiantly kept playing past dark.
- The dwelling places of Europe have an air of inheritance, or cumulative possession - a hive occupied by generations of bees.
- People are incorrigibly themselves.
- In fiction, imaginary people become realer to us than any named celebrity glimpsed in a series of rumored events, whose causes and subtler ramifications must remain in the dark. An invented figure like Anna Karenina or Emma Bovary emerges fully into the light of understanding, which brings with it identification, sympathy and pity.
- There's a crystallization that goes on in a poem which the young man can bring off, but which the middle-aged man can't.
- I love my government not least for the extent to which it leaves me alone.
- We are drawn to artists who tell us that art is difficult to do and takes a spiritual effort, because we are still puritan enough to respect a strenuous spiritual effort.
- For some of us, books are intrinsic to our sense of personal identity.
- What interests me is why men think of women as witches. It's because they're so fascinating and exasperating, so other.
- Some stories or passages are more difficult and demand more fussing with than others, but, in general, I'm a two-draft writer rather than a six-draft writer, or whatever.
- Imagine writing a poem with a sweating, worried-looking boy handing you a different pencil at the end of every word. My golf, you may say, is no poem; nevertheless, I keep wanting it to be one.
- That a marriage ends is less than ideal; but all things end under heaven, and if temporality is held to be invalidating, then nothing real succeeds.
- In art, anything goes, and if it goes, it goes.
- The first author I met socially was Joyce Cary.
- Publishers are looking for blockbusters - all the world loves a megaseller.
- The first breath of adultery is the freest; after it, constraints aping marriage develop.
- Mars has long exerted a pull on the human imagination. The erratically moving red star in the sky was seen as sinister or violent by the ancients: The Greeks identified it with Ares, the god of war; the Babylonians named it after Nergal, god of the underworld. To the ancient Chinese, it was Ying-huo, the fire planet.
- My complaint, as an exile who once loved New York and who likes to return a half-dozen times a year, is not that it plays host to extremes of the human condition: There is grandeur in that, and necessity.
