- You write about what you know, and you write about what you want to know.

- The vehemence with which certain critics have chosen not simply to criticize what I've written, but to challenge my writing this story at all, speaks of what the book is about: fear of disapproval.
- I believed my story would be helpful to young women my daughter's age, who are still in the process of forming themselves as women, and in need of encouragement to remain true to themselves.
- Nothing like being visible, publishing one's work, and speaking openly about one's life, to disabuse the world of the illusion of one's perfection and purity.
- It is not the task of a reader to please her subjects.

- If I told you about all the stories I don't tell, I would be violating the very boundaries I set for myself.
- At Home in the World is the story of a young woman, raised in some difficult circumstances, and how she survives. It tells a story of redemption, not victimhood.
- The portrait of my parents is a complicated one, but lovingly drawn.

- It troubles me that people speak about writing for money as ugly and distasteful.
- If people choose to live their life in a way that does not confront the more troubling aspects of their experience, that's fine, if it works for them. But it will probably make them uncomfortable if they come up against somebody like me. So they just shouldn't! They shouldn't read my work!
