- I think the makeup and the effects that I saw on 'The Walking Dead,' I'd never seen anything like that in my life. Those guys are just geniuses.
- One of my dream roles would be to play a man.
- A couple months before I got the audition for 'Arrow,' my husband and I had just sold everything we owned, packed our dogs and belongings into a truck, and moved to Los Angles with a prayer and almost no money. When I ended up booking the role, we both cried from joy and gratitude for a week straight.
- I wanted to be an astronomer until I discovered I'm terrible at math.
- I was always an athlete; my grandfather and my dad are basketball players, and I played sports my whole life.
- When I auditioned for The Black Canary, I only knew I was reading for a new recruit on team 'Arrow.' It wasn't until I'd booked the role that they told me who I'd be playing.
- I make damn good biscuits and gravy. The key is maple sausage.
- One of the things that has been the most beneficial for me in real life is that I've been able to really become stronger physically, and so I try to get to the gym at least - while I'm working, it's hard sometimes.
- I guess I'd love to play Storm in 'X-Men.'
- It's tough to run fast and jump off roofs when your feet are freezing off!
- The cool thing about superheroes is that they all have these very human roots, and that brings them all together and makes them all the same, in a way.

- I've been a fan of comics, but I've never been, like, a diehard: like, I've never really owned a bunch of comics or anything. But I've always been drawn to them and read them.
- I started watching 'Flash' and 'Supergirl.' I love them both.
