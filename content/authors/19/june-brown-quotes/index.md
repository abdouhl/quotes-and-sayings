- In 1930, when I was three and my sister was four, my father sent us to Miss Tracy's, a little 'dame's school' in Ipswich. I do remember playing with an abacus. He took us away after a term because he thought we weren't learning anything.

- I'm not bragging but I used to be rather beautiful, with lovely legs, and people would always ask me to dance. But suddenly people didn't take any notice of me any more. I was at a party in my 50s and was forced to dance with a chair because nobody wanted to dance with me.

- I was a procrastinator and a bookworm but I passed all my School Certificate exams, the equivalent of O-levels; I got three distinctions, three honours and three good passes.

- I think when you are older, you should be slowing down, but I wouldn't like not to work as I would get rather miserable.
