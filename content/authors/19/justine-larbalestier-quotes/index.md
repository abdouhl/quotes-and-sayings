- My favourite vampires are all very scary indeed. So the idea of falling in love with one is just weird to me.
- I give people 'If You Came Softly' when they demand proof that novels for teens can be as good as the best novels for adults.
- I travel way too much to have any pets. But if I could have one, I'd want a quokka. They're basically small kangaroos native to Western Australia.
- I'm one of those sad cases who've never wanted to be anything but a writer. I started writing my first novel when I was five years old. I have no idea what it was about, but I do remember spending considerable time trying to get the title right, though this had more to do with crayon colour than scansion.
- I remember that feeling when I was a young reader: finding books that were set in Sydney with Australian characters was incredibly exciting.
- When I was little, I made up my own fairy tales, and the ghostly echo of 'Once upon a time' shapes all the fiction I've ever written.
- Eating good food is my favourite thing in the whole world. Nothing is more blissful.
