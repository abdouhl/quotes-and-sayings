quotes = ['''My kids like it when I sit with them and watch the movies or games they are interested in.''' ,'''I strongly feel there is nothing like a trend or even 'new generation movies.' A movie can be of a new generation only in terms of technology and nothing else.''' ,'''I don't take films to prove my talent and receive critical acclaim or awards.''' ,''''Poovizhi Vasalile' was remade into five languages, including Hindi, and I played the same role in all.''' ,'''Entertaining audiences is of prime priority for me. If they feel entertained, through that I get appreciation and my talent is therefore proved.''' ,'''I'm eagerly looking forward to substantial roles from Kollywood filmmakers.''' ,'''There have been instances of many trying to pull me down in Mollywood. However, I have no complaints.''' ,'''I will be working with Akshay Kumar in the upcoming Raghava Lawrence film 'Laxmmi Bomb.' I can't say much, but can mention that it is a very important, positive role, and the character is someone who will be with the lead actor, so there will be no fights with him.''' ,'''I will play a villain only if the role is a powerful one.''' ,'''I am looking for variety roles.''' ,'''It is not easy to find the right story and director.''' ,'''Martial arts have always been a major part of my life.''' ,'''I have never taken supplements or steroids in my life and the only luxury I allow myself is tea.''' ,'''I teach mixed martial arts and I am having a gala time running a school dedicated to it.''' ,'''There were many fruit trees in our house when I was growing up and I never missed climbing any of them.''' ,'''Of late, Mollywood has been having many films that are being made not because the makers think it will be accepted by the audience; but because they know that they can get back their investment made in the film by selling its satellite rights. This, I believe, is a very bad trend.''' ,'''When I emerged as a hero, there were times I had continuous hits in Malayalam. I also tasted success as a supporting actor in other languages. But there was a collective effort from a group in the Malayalam film industry to flush me out, which affected my career.''' ,'''I agree to play a character if I feel that as an audience member, it will entertain me.''' ,'''I remember that alongside the expected dishes, our family had a few of our own specials too like 'meen manga curry,' which had a yummy green colored gravy.''' ,'''I believe that an actor should be like water, free-flowing and extremely flexible.''' ,'''There is enough space for everyone in the Tamil industry and it is free of politics.''' ,'''Generally, occasions like Maundy Thursday and Easter can strictly be family affairs for Christian households. But, while I was growing up in my ancestral home in Ponkunnam in Kottayam district, they weren't so. My late dad was a very cool, affable person who liked to involve our friends and neighbors too in such celebrations.''' ,'''Sometime ago, I went for a film festival in San Francisco and that's where I met film director Warren Foster and actors Robert Parham and Randy Taylor, by chance.''' ,'''I don't do every film that comes my way.''' ,'''I'm not interested in doing every role that is coming my way.''' ,'''I am not getting many offers in Mollywood, which is not the case in other film industries. And of the roles that are offered to me, I choose only the best.''' ,'''Especially today, Mollywood's action scenes comprise of many 'hero touches and the villain flies' scenes. I never promoted that, and only believed in realistic stunts, with just the right amount of cinematic feel seasoned on them.''' ,'''I'm proud to have associated with a small, yet beautiful film like 'Kaaka Muttai.'''' ,'''It's been almost 10 years since I had done an out-and-out action movie, as I have also been diversifying into roles of other genre.''' ,'''I never agree to do a character that molests a woman. I have been very conscious not to do such roles. I believe that even a villain should have character, which people can remember.''' ,'''Even at home, I am not too much into trainings and workouts.''' ,'''I think filmmakers need to explore more in the action genre.''' ,'''Martial art is a nice path to healthy body, mind, and spirit.''' ,'''I'm excited about my directorial debut, 'Piano.'''' ,]
