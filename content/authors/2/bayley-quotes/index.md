- Fans come with pictures. People give me headbands, and girls have bracelets. It's really cool to get to meet them.
- I never really look at other people; I just worry about myself.
- When I made my debut, I had that weird one-off at 'Battleground' where I was, like, Sasha's partner. And that was an amazing night.
- Wherever we go, NXT fans are extremely loud, and it's not like a normal WWE live event.
- I've always tried to be a leader.
- It's just insane because, as a longtime WWE fan, I still have all of my action figures in storage. Now to have my own, and to see my nephews play with them, to see kids tweet me pictures with them, and to see people are actually going out of their way searching all of these stores trying to find them, it's really cool and humbling.
- I think I have done everything I can here in NXT, and I do want to test myself on the main roster.
- I'm just easy to get along with.
- I trained with a locker room and roster full of men, and we were all a family, and they all took care of me like their little sister. It's what I want out of a locker room. I think it helps the locker room, and it's a part of the success of the NXT women's division.
- I think NXT, as a whole, is kind of like a family, so we're not competitive. We're supportive.
- I was a tomboy. I wasn't like the other girly girls.
- I respect Asuka for all she's done in her career all over the globe and for what she's done here in NXT in such a short amount of time, but this is my home. The pride she has in Japanese wrestling, I have in NXT.
- I remember having the opportunity to meet Ivory, as a kid, and she was the first woman's wrestler that I met. She looked at me and said, 'I'm going to see you in the ring one day, aren't I?'
- You know when you first meet someone and they shake your hand? Hugging is how I shake hands.
- When I make my entrance to the ring or give someone a high-five, I want them to feel happy and always remember that moment.
- I feel comfortable talking to Vince, which seems so crazy for me to say. For me, I've been a fan, I've been watching him forever, and I'm like, 'Yeah, I'm comfortable to talk to Vince McMahon.'
- I'd like to think I'm ambitious, and I like proving people wrong and surprising people.
- There's a little daredevil inside of me.
- For my TakeOver matches, I was always just a huge mess, a huge ball of nerves.
- When I saw Daniel Bryan win the world title, that was the most incredible atmosphere, especially after Undertaker just losing his streak, which was such an awkward and weird feeling in the building. To feel the feeling of the fans once Daniel Bryan wins his title - it was... I can't even explain it.
- This sounds like I'm a loser, but when I'm feeling down, or I need a bit of motivation, I do watch old NXT matches because they have some of my favourite memories as a performer in WWE.
- I would really like to go to Mexico.
- I'm not here to put bruises on people's backs or to send them to the hospital. I'm here to put smiles on people's faces.
- I started CrossFit before WrestleMania 33, and it's helped my body get a lot stronger.
- It's been a long road for me coming from NXT. I've been with NXT for almost four years, and just getting to WWE, and now being able to travel with them, I kind of have to make new friends and get hotel rooms and travel in different cities every single night. It's very different, but it's so much fun.
- To me, wrestling always comes first.
- When I started this character, it was me being 12 years old again. We would have other wrestlers come to our promos, and I'd geek out over them and show my excitement. I would just grab them and not let go.
- If I were to have a match with Lita, I would make that a championship ladder match.
- Asuka is just insane, and she has such a different background and things I've never seen before, so I'd say I'm a little bit more worried of Asuka because I don't know much about her.
- Sasha and I are so lucky to have The Revival on 'Raw' with us, and we're so lucky to be such good friends with them because they help us so much in understanding the why in so many things. They teach us the psychology of actually being a tag team - people don't understand that.
- With social media now, we kind of get that inside look at WWE Superstars' lives.
- As a performer, I need to change in the ring, to be a little bit more aggressive and go about things in a different way rather than Bayley following the rules all the time.
- I got to work with Nia Jax when she just started, and that's just a whole other obstacle: like, I've never been in the ring with someone like her before.
- It's hilarious to see guys wearing a headband with 'I'm a Hugger' on it.
- I played everything. I played volleyball, did track, cross-country, but basketball was my main sport, my main focus.
- It's not like I don't like the term 'Diva.' It's what you make of it.
- I loved The Rock. He was my favorite for a long time.
- If the coffee can taste so good with nothing else in it, then that's a good cup of coffee.
- I kind of felt like maybe I didn't have what it took to look like a supermodel and wear high heels all the time and my nails.
- I've beaten some of the wisest, most opportunistic and powerful women, and I will prove to Asuka that she is not unstoppable.
- I was into 'Crash Bandicoot.' 'Croc.' I loved 'Twisted Metal.' And as far as the WWE and wrestling games? All of them. I played 'SmackDown! Just Bring It' and 'Smackdown vs. Raw.'
- Parents will often thank me for being a good role model for their kids or tell me, 'You'll never understand how much you mean to my daughter,' so then I feel I don't want to let down the parents, either.
- It's always a lot of fun to get to interact with people and meet different fans.
- When I first started training, my trainer told me to stop smiling so much. It was just fun to me. I couldn't help it.
- Sasha Banks. She has it all; she has everything. Her mind works like no other, and her heart is undeniable.

- I'm at the forefront of the NXT women's division, and it's really humbling to think that I'm not just a part of this new era but that I'm the leader of it.
- I plan on headlining WrestleMania by WrestleMania 35.
- You have a goal in life, and to achieve what you want, you've got to do what you've got to do.
- I want a one-on-one match with Sasha Banks. A Fatal Four-Way with Sasha, Becky Lynch, and Charlotte would also be great some day at a WrestleMania.
- Social media is so huge.
- With the likes of Rey Mysterio back in WWE, I find myself watching him and feeling inspired and that I need to get better and get to that next level.
- Bayley is a dream chaser. She's grown up watching the product, wrestling, WWE, everything. She knows everyone, from top to bottom, all the history. She's been motivated since she was 10-years-old and is finally here, trying to pursue the dream, live the dream to the fullest.
- Of course I want to be champion because that means you're the best, but I just love wrestling, and if I can have good matches week in and week out, that would make me happy.
- When I was a kid watching wrestling, that's kind of how it was. You had these long feuds and storylines, and you just got more and more interested, and you wanted to see where it was going to go. You wanted to see the big blow-off match, and I like that stuff because that's what I grew up watching.
- It always sounds so cheesy when I say it, but whatever it is you want to do, just go for it. I don't care what it is: find a reputable school, or if you need to go to college or get the right training, just go do it and take little steps.
- Going to places like Chicago and New York as the champion is kind of what was really special for me.
- Honestly, I just want to wrestle! Like, I don't need to be in these crazy gimmick matches or always be working for the championship.
- When you're in a tag match, like, you have this tag partner, and you make it known that you have this partner that you can work with.
- Triple H really prepares everybody for WWE in everything we do in NXT, and everything we do in the performance center is to prepare us for WWE.
- I love being the NXT Women's Champion.
- My favorite WrestleMania moment would actually be the first WrestleMania I ever went to, and that was at WrestleMania 30 in New Orleans. I've been a fan forever but have never been able to go to an actual WrestleMania until I started working with the company.
- People want to see John Cena - they want to see all these guys - but I want people to buy tickets because they want to see the girls and they're looking forward to the Divas matches.
- People want to see Ronda Rousey because she is an attraction.
- We've worked with Special Olympics Florida before, and I had so much fun doing that. It was really inspiring to meet all the athletes.
- When I first started my character in my first match with Alicia Fox, I walked out with my hair in a ponytail, and as soon as I got into the ring, I took the ponytail out and let my hair down, because I knew it would get messed up, and I didn't want to look ridiculous on TV.
- The blue gear with the red dinosaur is special to me because that's the first gear I wore in NXT.
- Paige is someone who is very close to me - ya know, outside of the ring - she helped me when I first got to NXT.
- Making my family, friends, and close peers proud of me is the most important thing.
- I kinda started watching wrestling through Lucha Libre because my grandmother was always watching Lucha Libre.
- I hated having my hair down because it got into my face when I was playing sports. My mom would always put my hair down and make it all pretty, and by the time I got to school, I would have it up in a ponytail.
- We all know, going into this business and stepping into the ring, there's a possibility of injury. But you're never expecting it to happen, and when it does, it's just the worst thing ever.
- I really like Pete Dunne. His grittiness and aggressiveness is something I want to learn from and something I wish I could be a little more of in the ring.
- Tyler Breeze! He is so amazing. He taught me so much about psychology when I was in NXT; he helped me so much with my matches with Eva Marie or Asuka.
- Honestly, it's an insane, weird connection that I really feel with fans instantly when I come out, because I'm still very much a fan myself, and I still can't believe that I get to do this every single day.
- When I started listening to Paramore, I was in high school, and they were, like, 15. Seeing somebody at such a young age have that ambition, I thought, holy crap, they were so young. They seemed like cool people, and I really liked the music.
- Triple H and all the coaches have been very helpful and supportive of everything that I have done.
- Personally, I've struggled with a lot of doubt in myself at times.
- Growing up watching WWE, they used to have bra-and-panties matches or pillow fights, and that's why my mom didn't want me to watch wrestling. But when my parents divorced, I was able to watch wrestling again, and that's when I started to really get into wrestlers like Ivory.
- I don't really sweat the petty things.
- I sweat a lot because I get really nervous.
- I'm very proud of 'NXT.'
- Any time I get to wrestle Sasha, I always want to do it.
- It's very cool to inspire other girls to be a WWE star.
- I loved 'WWF No Mercy' for the Nintendo 64. One of my favorites games was 'WCW Thunder.' I loved playing that game, and I loved being The Steiner Brothers. They were so cool, and they were some of the most powerful characters.
- This might sound bad, but I really want to work with Eva Marie, just because it seems like that's what people want.
- It's really important: you can be the best wrestler in the world and make the most money, but if you're not a good person in the back, that says a lot about you. I've never wanted to be that person, because I've had so much help along the way, and I want to continue that.
- My goal is to be the women's champion, to main event on a regular basis, to be at 'WrestleMania.'
- Every match that I have, I always feel like I'm more nervous than the last one.
- For me, the only way I know how to do this is to be myself. I actually learned that from 'The Dream' Dusty Rhodes. I was trying to be this wrestler, and I was trying to be cool, and Dusty literally told me, 'You've got to be yourself.' That's really how Bayley started, and that is what brought me this far.
- Thinking about how far I've come, it's so crazy to me.
- I have a bunch of fan art. I love it.
- I was really sensitive because people would say they thought I was a boy or call me a boy and stuff like that. I always had my hair back and, like I said, baggy clothes. So it was kind of sad. I didn't know what to do about it, and I didn't know what I was doing wrong because I was just being me.
- When I first started to learn to run the ropes, that was really painful for me: it's just cable wire wrapped in tape. It bruised my ribs so bad, it hurt to be hugged; it hurt to lay down.
- Ever since I lost the Women's Championship to Askua, I feel like I've been targeted in a whole different way. People have tried to keep me down and keep me away from the title picture to make sure that I never get a chance again.
