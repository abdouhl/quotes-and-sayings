- The way other kids would watch 'The Little Mermaid' or 'Sesame Street,' I would watch 'Fiddler on the Roof.'

- Everyone always said, 'When you're 10, you'll want to be Elizabeth, or when you're in college.' And every time, I was was just like, 'No, I'm Beanie. That's who I am.' So I love my name because I think it really suits me.

- I have this saying: They either want The Bean or they don't want The Bean. I just am my own thing. It works or it doesn't work.
- My real name is Elizabeth, but I had a nanny growing up who called me 'Elizabeanie.' So from 4 months old, my brothers were, like, 'Let's call her Beanie.' To show people the validity of it, I always say that if I met the president, I would say, 'Hi, my name is Beanie.'
