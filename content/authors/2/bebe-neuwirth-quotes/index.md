- It's a blessing as an artist to express myself - whether that be via dance, via song or via speech - in so many different ways.
- I am a very complicated person.
- I missed New York. Every break I had from the series, I'd fly back to the East Coast just to get back onstage.

- Part of the success of the show is that the audience sees themselves in the characters, becomes the characters. The more they inhabit the characters, the more they see.

- On the rare occasions I go to the gym, I prefer silence.
- Shakespeare feels very natural to me.
- Certainly the life of a dancer is very difficult. The training is very hard and relentlessly grueling.
- I've been on stage since I was 7. That's where I'd rather be than anywhere else. Just because you can do a bunch of things doesn't mean you are a bunch of things. I can act. I can sing. But I am a dancer.
- I am just a plain Jew; I mean have no training.
- When I was born, they put casts on my legs 'cause I had some kind of dysplasia or something. My legs were all messed up.
- Creating a role is an interesting thing - each show or each situation is different.

- I don't see myself as a diva at all.
- I don't see my dancing or acting as two separate things. I don't define them separately, so I can't say one has helped the other, It's all the same thing. More than anything I love being on stage and performing.
- If I'm not in shape, it feels like something is wrong. If I haven't been able to get to class for a while or I've been sick, I don't feel complete. It doesn't feel like the electricity is making its connections.
