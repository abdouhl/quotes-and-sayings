- I said, '200 pairs of jeans,' and then it just kind of went everywhere. I don't really own 200 pairs of jeans - I own a million pairs of jeans. No, but I definitely have a very solid amount. I won't say a number, but it's aggressive.

- In L.A., I love being with my friends and being able to eat out and wear tank tops at night.
- My devotion stemmed from my mom's love of horses. I have been riding since I could walk, and the fact that my mom knew everything about horses really helped my passion grow.
- I'd worn Joe's Jeans since I was young, so it was cool to be able to reinvent the brand and be able to be part of it.

- In L.A., I did a lot of vintage flea market dresses and Doc Martens.
- I think there's a right time for everything, and I'm a true believer that everything happens for a reason.

- Blondes are so angelic. My sister can get away with anything.

- I literally order sushi, watch 'Law & Order,' and go to sleep at 9 o'clock every night. I'm a grandmother.
