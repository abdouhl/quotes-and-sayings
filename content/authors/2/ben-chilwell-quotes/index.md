- I have always had confidence and known what I am capable of. So it is frustrating when you are not showing everyone.
- I was enjoying my football, even though it wasn't really going well. That's when I said to my dad, who as a New Zealander was very keen on me playing cricket, that I would choose football.
- I was an all-rounder but more of a batsman, maybe second-choice bowler.
- I'm very critical of myself and I know the levels I want to achieve so I'm very hard on myself. So the staff and players are very hard on me as well, which is what I want as I want to get to as high a level as possible.
