- I don't seek power and do not run around.
- There is a saying that every nice piece of work needs the right person in the right place at the right time.
- Both parents worshiped individual achievement, but because of the Depression and the war, they never achieved what they wanted and deserved. So their ambition and high expectations were transferred to me.
- The techniques I developed for studying turbulence, like weather, also apply to the stock market.
- Where do I really belong? I avoid saying everywhere - which switches all too easily to nowhere. Instead, when pressed, I call myself a fractalist.
- I was in an industrial laboratory because academia found me unsuitable.
- An exquisitely complex shape now known as the Mandlebrot set has been called the most complex object in mathematics.
- An extraordinary amount of arrogance is present in any claim of having been the first in inventing something.
- For much of my life there was no place where the things I wanted to investigate were of interest to anyone.
- Now that I near 80, I realize with wistful pleasure that on many occasions I was 10, 20, 40, even 50 years ahead of my time.

- My fate has been that what I undertook was fully understood only after the fact.
- There's nothing really connecting the behavior of the Nile, metallurgy, and the behavior of prices except that I had the mathematical tools to explain them.
- Most were beginning to feel they had learned enough to last for the rest of their lives. They remained mathematicians, but largely went their own way.
