- I wear the same black suit. I have five of them. I pair them with a red scarf. I was wearing a red scarf when I won the first architectural competition of my career.
- When I designed my loft, I literally framed the World Trade Center as a picture postcard I could see from my bed. I no longer have that image, and I mourn it.
- Before 2000, everything was about being contextual, and buildings were supposed to be good citizens.
- I think architects are often at their best when faced with restraints.
- The ultimate pleasure of architecture lies in the most forbidden parts of the architectural act, where limits are perverted and prohibitions are transgressed.
- Society secretly delights in crime, excesses, and violated prohibitions of all sorts.
- My apartment reflects my views as an architect. It is minimal, austere. The architecture doesn't impose itself upon you. The apartment is a stage for other things to take place.
- I feel very comfortable in New York, in a city where there is no such thing as 'nationality.'
- I never talked about architecture with my father, which I regret.
- I was once in a very, very bad car accident. So my drawing arm is full of pins and platinum stuff. Occasionally it hurts. But I found that after the arm was put back together I could draw better than before. I have no idea why.
- The general public will almost always stand behind the traditionalists. In the public eye, architecture is about comfort, about shelter, about bricks and mortar.
