Those older fans who expect something from The Roots are a tad more important to me than getting new fans.''' ,'''For some music, lyrically, the best move is to keep it simple in what it is that you are saying, and just kind of come across in your rhythm and the way that you lock in on the music.''' ,'''When I was coming up, a freestyle wasn't a freestyle unless everything was completely improvised, in-the-moment and right there, and you had to incorporate various elements of what was going on in the room on the day.''' ,'''We usually overrecord. Then we boil it down to the cream of the cream.''' ,'''For me, I'm a super private person.''' ,'''I don't know that Dilla was the father of neo-soul as much as he was highly influential in that time when he was doing what he was doing at his best... Dilla's influence transcended genre and it transcended region.''' ,'''It's weird what can trigger the beginning of a song or some bars. It can be a banging slice of apple pie or it can be smelling a certain perfume or something.''' ,'''I'll read a book. I'll watch a documentary or a film or whatever.

It's like if someone's writing a novel: You write a series of drafts.''' ,'''Anyone that I've ever worked with, it's not like I just meet you or someone throws us together for the sole purpose of coming up with a song that's gonna be a hit. I have to have some sort of relationship, or we had to have interacted on some other sort of level and that's when it feels most natural.''' ,'''The most profound memory I have from my childhood is burning down my house at 6 years old.''' ,'''I love Trader Joe's.''' ,'''I feel like the youthful experience is what drives the creativity, and I feel like experience and maturity as an adult, experience as an elder statesman, that refines it.''' ,'''As we get further into our career we're figuring out how to become more efficient as artists, and doing so many different things is testament to our cohesiveness as the Roots.''' ,'''Something that is funny, that I use sometimes if I'm doing comedy, is the fact that I'm now often mistaken for the rapper Rick Ross.

It will gradually be the result of a change in the appetite of the audience.''' ,'''You are an instrument if you understand your voice and how to use it - this sound, that sound and certain ranges and different pitch. Within that I try to find a rhythm and play the voice as if it was a horn.''' ,'''I'm tryin' to get some acting credibility, get some other work.''' ,'''By the time I was, you know, 16 years old, I had done a lot of growing up.''' ,'''There's a lot of terms we come up with for the music that we're making because we want something that's going to be definitive. Often there is no word to encapsulate the emotion that the music represents.''' ,'''I strive for improvement. want to be a master of my craft.''' ,'''What we do every day onstage, there's lights, there's lots of other musicians, there's an audience, there's a microphone and mic stands - layers of the onion we have to kind of hide behind.''' ,'''Don't do anything for fear, because fear will never do anything for you.''' ,'''The first rhymes I wrote, I was 9.

It's giving back to your community, it's investing in oneself, and you know women and children.''' ,'''Everything I do has been a lifetime in the making.''' ,'''We've always been a band that intentionally transcended race and age.''' ,'''We've been branded 'the thinking man's hip-hop.' So the music's got to have some level of maturity.''' ,'''I've become a functioning cog in the machine called The Roots, but in my youth I was comin' from a more braggadocious, egotistical perspective.''' ,'''Nah, I don't feel overlooked, underappreciated, or none of that because it's a short list of artists, past and present, that I kind of have respect for. And in all of those situations, the admiration and respect is mutual.''' ,'''I made the mistake of going to a barber who was not from Philly, and let's just say, I would never do that again.''' ,'''In a lot of places Jay-Z is considered God, Philly, our hometown being one of them.''' ,'''I move in silence.
