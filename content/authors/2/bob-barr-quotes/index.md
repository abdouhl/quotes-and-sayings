quotes = ['''The seemingly omnipresent storm clouds hanging over the Constitution often make it hard to find a silver lining. Every day, the front page of The Drudge Report is littered with stories of government assaults on our civil liberties - from local government officials all the way up to the Oval Office.''' ,'''Taking privacy cues from the federal government is - to say the least - ironic, considering today's Orwellian level of surveillance. At virtually any given time outside of one's own home, an American citizen can reasonably assume his movements and actions are being monitored by something, by somebody, somewhere.''' ,'''History has shown that Big Government expands quickest in the immediate aftermath of a crisis - real or manufactured.''' ,'''Unfortunately, most gun control advocates are not really interested in rational debate, and their political games simply send Alice chasing white rabbits down holes.''' ,'''Despite two decisions, in 2008 and 2010, by the U.S. Supreme Court unequivocally affirming that the Second Amendment to the Constitution guarantees an individual right to keep and bear arms against infringement by the government, state legislatures continue to do just that - enact laws that significantly infringe this fundamental human right.''' ,'''MoveOn loves government. It remains enamored of government spending as fuel for its liberal agenda; and anything that threatens to close that spigot in any degree is perceived as a dire threat - worthy of Chicken-Little warnings that the sky is going to fall.''' ,'''Going to war against Iran - whether one calls such a move 'surgical' or 'total' - would be an extremely serious undertaking; with worldwide economic, military, diplomatic and human ramifications in both the short- and the long-term.''' ,'''It's not a gun control problem; it's a cultural control problem.''' ,'''When conducted with proper preparation, and in a focused and professional manner, oversight of executive branch actions can reveal serious shortcomings by government officials and help prevent recurrence; the 'Waco hearings,' conducted over a two-week period in 1995, stand as an example of such an undertaking.''' ,'''Chicago is known for good steaks, expensive stores and beautiful architecture. Unfortunately, the Windy City also enjoys a reputation for corrupt politics, violent crime, and some of the strictest gun control laws anywhere in the country.''' ,'''For decades, parents were told by so-called parenting 'experts' that offspring would be best raised on the belief each is special and entitled to all life has to offer.''' ,'''People come up to me and tell me they support me because I never left my principles.''' ,'''The world is undoubtedly a safer, freer place because Thatcher - like Reagan - refused to back down when it came to defending freedom.''' ,'''The move to tax Internet sales, clothed as a 'fairness' issue, is the typical 'wolf-in-sheep's-clothing' ploy so often used by governments unwilling to cut expenditures to match revenues. It matters not whether its proponents have a 'D' or an 'R' after their name. It is a tax increase in either case.''' ,'''It is high time for some congressional oversight backbone.''' ,'''The 2011 riots in England, which left five dead and caused more than $300 million in property damage, were fueled by a generation of young Brits who grew up without ever hearing the word 'No.'''' ,'''The legal principle placing the burden of proof on accusers rather than the accused can be traced back to Second and Third Century Roman jurist, Julius Paulus Prudentissimus. Yet, this ancient concept, which forms the legal and moral cornerstone of the American judicial system, is quickly being undermined in the name of 'national security.'''' ,'''It is not just software glitches and corrupted memory cards that should be on the minds of election officials. Hackers pose another very real problem whereby an election could be tilted towards a favored candidate.''' ,'''People and organizations other than doctors increasingly are assuming power to decide which medications to prescribe or procedures to undertake. More and more, decisions about personal healthcare are no longer made by the treating physicians in consultation with their patients, and based on the doctors' expertise.''' ,'''Presidential and vice-presidential debates are not about campaign staff or consultants, and it is high time we as a people took control and reminded them and their candidates of that important fact.''' ,'''Courts have long recognized the federal government's robust power to inspect people and goods entering the country. After all, the very foundation of national sovereignty is a nation's ability to protect its borders.''' ,'''For far too long the American public and business sector have kept their silence as civil liberties have been whittled away by statutory and regulatory measures.''' ,'''Now, national conventions are largely an excuse for companies and party leaders to throw parties for delegates to attend, to network and have a good time.''' ,'''Nobody is denying we should investigate and do what we can to prevent gun crime in our cities and towns. But, we should not scapegoat the American gun owner for complicated, cultural problems we are just beginning to understand.''' ,'''I'm pro-life but I believe that the federal government ought to stay out of it. That's a decision that the people of each state ought to make for themselves.''' ,'''The average American returning from a trip abroad likely - and understandably - assumes the contents of his or her electronic device does not come close to meeting the threshold of 'criminal' activity, such as would give a government agent the right to seize and peruse their iPad just because they are returning from a vacation.''' ,'''There are hundreds of fine journalists who regularly inform us of what is happening in the world around us; and innumerable commentators who provide intelligent and objective insight on public policy matters.''' ,'''In a single generation, the Internet has given to virtually every person on the face of the earth the ability to communicate with fellow human beings on virtually any topic, at any time, and in every nook and cranny on the globe. This magnificent invention has done this without succumbing to government control.''' ,'''The backlash against Big Government is an encouraging sign of a growing resistance to the mission creep of federal power.''' ,'''Organizations worried about the potential for e-voting problems have long-advocated for audit procedures by which votes cast by e-voting machines could be verified through audit trails.''' ,'''Iran is not a make-believe country. It is a real country populated by some 75 million people - real people; including, I daresay, a majority who are philosophically and by education inclined toward the modern, secular world, and particularly American values.''' ,'''The Tea Party knows that continuing to delay charting a course to spending reform hurts everybody.''' ,'''On taking office, Obama promised the 'most transparent' administration in history; yet his record as president has been anything but transparent.''' ,'''Looking down the road, space exploration and the benefits it yields - in medicine and information technology - should not be overlooked.''' ,'''Widespread use of online voting will create the potential for abuse that will make the problems inherent in e-voting pale in comparison.''' ,'''Firearms manufacturers usually find themselves playing defense.''' ,'''It is difficult, if not impossible, to argue that laws written in the 1970s are adequate for today's intelligence challenges.''' ,'''Accepting federal funding undermines state sovereignty as states become beholden to federal requirements in order to keep the money flowing.''' ,]
