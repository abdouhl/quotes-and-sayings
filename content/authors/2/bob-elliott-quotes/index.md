quotes = ['''My son Chris said he was 12 years old before he knew what I did for a living.''' ,'''Ray and I both grew up with radio. Our whole hopes for the future were that we'd get into radio.''' ,'''Kurt Vonnegut said, 'The best of Bob and Ray is virtually indistinguishable from the worst.' I'm sure he meant that as a compliment.''' ,'''I paint. I have been painting since I was kid. If I hadn't gone into radio when I did, I probably would have come out of the Army, gone into the art business, and probably would have flopped because I'm not that great.''' ,'''I like jokes, but Ray and I, we never did jokes. We weren't in that line of humor. We each contributed our own kind of observations. I'm glad to have people look at and laugh at and respect and get some creative juice out of what we did by observing.''' ,]
