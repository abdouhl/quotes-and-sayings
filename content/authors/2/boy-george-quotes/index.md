- When Culture Club broke up, I hadn't been going out a lot because we'd been working all the time, so I suddenly had this period of leisure. And it was just around the time that the whole acid house thing kicked off in London.
- Part of me looks at the gay movement now and worries that we're losing our individuality.
- I don't know what the switch is from being insane to sane. It could be a number of things, what I eat, drink.
- I can be quite noisy and robust in the morning.

- A lot of what I've been learning in the last two years is due to therapy - about my sexuality, why things go wrong, why relationships haven't worked. It isn't anything to do with anybody else; it's to do with me.
- I look back now, and most of the drama in my life was self-inflicted. I don't need to make up so much drama now.
- I don't listen to the radio, so I don't really know what's going on in current pop culture. I know about the obvious things, like Taylor Swift and Justin Bieber and Ed Sheeran and Adele, because I hear them. They're everywhere.
- To me, I think of the '70s as being this glorious decade where I discovered who I was and discovered all these amazing things... punk rock, electro music, fashion, all of that.
- I get over things really quickly, and I feel like in this business, you have to be like that.
- I'm not in love, but I'm open to persuasion.
- My dad was very explosive, God rest his soul. He could fly off the handle like no one I've ever known, and I have definitely got that in my personality: that ability to sort of smash the house up and then say, 'Put the kettle on,' to have that kind of attitude of, 'Well, I'm OK now, so everybody else has got to be OK.'
- Let's face it: I've got a bit of a reputation.
- I can't even read music. All I know is whether I think it sounds good and if I like what I'm doing.
- I just go in my back garden. It's the only place where people don't come and bother you.
- School is not a great place to have feminine features or a big nose, or to wear glasses or the wrong shoes.

- I was aware that the things that I did bothered people, but that only spurred me on even more.
- I started going to Madame Louise's, the lesbian club where all the punk bands used to go - the Sex Pistols, the Clash. I remember seeing Billy Idol walk in there; he was gorgeous.
- I was never a wallflower - I put my head on the style chopping block.
- My mother and father were fantastic, very active. I find it difficult to say this, but I'm quite a loving person and I've always been loving to my friends. In the long run, that pays off. I'm very interested in other people, and if you are, they're interested in you.
- I DJ'd and sang at Miami Basel 2013.
- There's a guy in London named Ben Cohen who is doing great things. In a way, we need people like Ben - we need straight guys to come out and say, 'What're you worried about? Get over yourself.' That's what we need! Because no one's listening to us - certainly, no one is listening to me.
- If you go back to the '80s, you had a whole plethora of artists, everyone from Madonna and Cyndi Lauper to Prince. God bless Lady Gaga for doing her thing, but she's kind of a lone peacock now. If anything, we have a much more conservative kind of pop world. It's not necessarily about individuality.
- Unless you insult my mother or something, there is not much you could say to me that would really bother me.
- I think there's something really powerful about being yourself.
- For artists of my caliber, we're not played on the radio, so we don't really get a chance to get involved in that debate at all. We don't get a chance, because this weird kind of ageism exists in pop music. If you're past a certain age, you're not relevant. That's the kind of cliched term.
- I went to prison; therefore, I've been rehabilitated, and now I want to get on with my life. I have paid for what I did, end of story.
- People like my honesty. When I'm sane, I'm very much myself.
- The ultimate goal is to be more satisfied. I really don't believe you get wiser because you get older. It's a choice, perhaps not to take some things so seriously.
- Seeing bored-looking fans staring at you while you DJ is about as horrible as it gets.
- I don't want to be a figure of disappointment.
- It's funny that I'm so popular with seven-, eight-, nine-year-olds.
- I've grown up very much living my life very visibly. I've never really hidden who I am.
- I went back to DJ'ing in 1987, and it's been an incredible second career for me. Plus, it's almost a parallel universe. If you don't go to underground clubs, you wouldn't know what I do or who I am. So there's been a whole new audience of people that don't even know I'm that 'Boy George', the one their mother used to like.
- Sometimes you surprise yourself with what you can handle, and if you come out the other end with some wisdom, then it's not such a bad thing.
- I always say I'm Catholic in my complications and Buddhist in my aspirations.
- In the early part of the '70s, we had glam rock, but we also had reggae and ska happening at the same time. I just took all those influences I had as a kid and threw them together, and somehow it works.
- I've got so much to be happy about.
- I was sick. I had a polyp on my throat. It would have been foolish for me to go out on the road with the problem I had.
- I'm a big fan of Yoko, one of those weird people who really love her music, and who argues with people all the time, because people do write her off.
- In a way, the most political thing you can do is be yourself.
- I was always good at music.
- I've never felt as though I didn't belong, I just acted as though I did.
- When I was in prison, a lot of my friends blew me away. But Stephen Fry wrote to me. It was very humbling.
- Beethoven had a great look. It was very much about the drama of appearance.
- I think what I love most about the raw food thing is it's real alchemy. It's a really interesting science, and I think for a creative person, it's a great way to eat.
- The more I dressed up, the more people reacted... the more I wanted to do it.
- My appetite for self-destruction and misery is greatly diminished. I'm not interested in being unhappy.
- In a way, we're going backwards. In the early '80s, it was like all these huge strides, and everything was more free and easy. I think we're going back. I don't know if it's the economics or what, but things are getting more right-wing, definitely.
- Bands like Culture Club and artists like me, you tend to concentrate on the live arena because that's where you can be your most authentic. That's where you have the most power.
- If you can write someone off as a bad person, then it's easier, but when someone is also great and noble and generous and kind and funny and contradictory, it gets harder.
- There's no better time than now to be who you are.
- My dad was quite an extreme man.
- I've sold a lot of records. I've sold, like, 150 million records, and I don't think I've had that many good reviews. It's one of those things that when you're really successful, critics hate you just because you're successful.
- Even from the age of about 6 years old, I was kind of made to feel different by other kids - you know, I was a quite pretty kid, and I got called 'girl' a lot, and 'woman' and all of that. And school is really not a place to be different.
- There are people you are madly in love with and thought you could never live without, and suddenly you break up and think, 'What was I thinking?'.

- You're in a band with someone, it doesn't necessarily mean you're going to agree with everything they think or do.
- Separation penetrates the disappearing person like a pigment and steeps him in gentle radiance.
- I'm a much more successful and happier person sober. And I'm nicer to be around.
- I look at myself at 19 and think I would never do what I did then now! I was so brazen, so confident, so fearless in a way. And remember, the world was a very aggressive place then.
- School is a scary place for kids. So I didn't like it, and I didn't want to be there. And it was a great day for me when they threw me out.
- I think life is about growing into yourself and getting to like that person.
- Sly Stone made such a huge contribution to the good feeling in the universe, and I love him as a singer.
- I try to exist in a world where there is freedom of opinion, where you're allowed to make jokes. I don't want to live in some PC world where no-one's allowed to say anything.
- When I was 19 or 20 and doing my thing, I can't sit here and say I had this strong political agenda - I was literally just being myself.
- I'm being honest, I say what I think.
- When you're successful, people have no sympathy. Nobody wants to catch the tears of a millionaire.
- My coming of age was in the '70s. A lot of people look back on it as a grim decade, but I look back on it as a liberating time.
- People that plan interviews are really boring. I just say what I want when it comes into my head.
- I don't play big stadium-style dance, but I have discovered, to my delight, that the appetite for real low slung deep house is very much alive.
- When I got sober, I really felt like there was something that was missing from my life, Buddhism is something that I practice.
- For some strange reason, my gay life didn't get easier when I came out. Quite the opposite happened, really.
- Luckily, I'm not one of those people who wants to be young; it's never bothered me.
- Remember that I was out of the closet at the age of sixteen. My parents knew I was gay; I'd had to tell them.
- I'm not responsible enough to have a dog - or a child.
- When I put out 'Same Thing In Reverse,' I was told categorically that this will never get played in America.
- Fans want more; they want you to perform in their living room. That's the nature of the beast.
- I'd rather they call me a national treasure than a national waste of time. And yes, it does feel good, but I've had to earn it.
- I just eat healthy and try not to eat late at night. And I exercise as well. That's a big change for me; I work out a lot.
- I was unwelcome in the U.S. for four years.
- I always judge my happiness by how much I listen to music.
- My life hasn't always been a disaster, it's just that when it has, it's been a spectacular disaster.
- I had to go off to do my own thing, to get my confidence as a writer, and a performer.
- I used to tell my mum to leave my dad when I was, like, nine. I loved my father, don't get me wrong. I really loved him, but he wasn't a good dad, and he wasn't a good husband.
- A lot of people felt I was getting work because I was Boy George. My response at the time was that there's a lot of DJs making records, they're not all making good records, but they have the right to do that.
- The struggle isn't just about being straight or gay or transgender - it's a human struggle. That's always really been my kind of starting point: If you're out there and you're odd, come over to my house.
- Compliments are very un-British, but when someone pays you one, you should take it.
- I've had to write in a different way because I'm not in a bad place and I'm not heartbroken, so there's no one I want revenge on.
- My audience here in America is so eclectic. It's a real mix of people, which is great. Like what I was doing with Culture Club - world music, multiculturalism - not defining everything in terms of sexuality or color. It was about everyone coming together and being part of something.
- On the street, on the train - I pull my hat down, and nobody knows it's me. I always wanted the kind of fame that came with an off button.
- At 16, I walked around knowing I'd get chased and attacked for dressing a certain way - I felt I had an undeniable right to be who I wanted to be. My father said to hit them back, but I was never much good at that. So I developed a big mouth instead of a quick right hook.
- I consider myself much more of a blues singer now.
- For someone like me, who has grown up with Joni Mitchell and Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen, it's hard not to invest a lot of myself in what I do.
- I never really tell lies, and sometimes it has worked against me.
- I knew that I was different when I was six years old, but it wasn't until I got to about 10 or 11 that I realised I was a gay man.
- I know that there are some people who don't like me, and that kind of surprises me more than the people who love me.
- I think people could be a bit friendlier. The only real contact you have with people is when they're annoyed if you've had a party - you know, it's been a bit too noisy for them or something.
- I never thought I'd be doing records a year after I started - I had no idea it would last as long as it did.
- As for Madonna, I always used to laugh at her running. And now I run! I get why she always ran. I wish I'd run when she did.
- I try to find happiness in almost anything... watching videos about new exercises, like ones you can do on a flight when you clench your buttocks.
- When you're in the world I'm in, sometimes you have to remember that when you see your friends, you need to ask them what they've been doing, and you need to grow up and learn your life isn't necessarily more interesting than other people's.
- I always think that change is like a daisy chain.
- I'm of the opinion that as a DJ you must always play what you love and ignore what's 'trendy' because true passion always eclipses what's fashionable. Quality is always fashionable.
- I don't really feel part of the pop scene.
- I've given up coffee, made diet changes.
- I had an explosion on my vocal chord.
- To be here in America so soon after the Supreme Court ruling on gay marriage and at the birth of the Caitlyn phenomena feels so timely. It feels perfect for my universe to collide with Caitlyn's, but on a purely personal level, I just think she is utterly fabulous and brave.
- Before I got famous, I was like a rake. When I was a teenager, I lived on nervous energy. And I always forgot to eat. It was not something I was obsessed with. And then suddenly I got famous, people started taking me out to fancy joints. And the pounds pile on. So I'm much more conscious now about when I eat. How I eat. What I eat.
- I always feel that my whole life is representing the LGBT community. It's kind of what I do all the time.
- Sometimes, having a reputation can be the best thing because people expect you to be really difficult, perhaps a bit caustic, and hard work - and I'm none of those things.
- People say things about me all the time and I get over it. I've had some appalling things told about me.
- There's 'Erewhon', a whole big super store where they do incredible raw vegan food.
- If you listen to the radio, and something beats you into surrender, like 'REO Speedwagon', and you really hate them, there's 'You Can Go Your Own Way' in your ear all day, and that's what makes a good song.
- I think that's the fascinating thing about the '70s is that it turns out it was quite a dark decade. But, like, who knew?
- An actor is a guy who, if you ain't talking about him, he ain't listening.
- There are lots of things about me that have changed. Some things are a process; some things take time.
- People in Scunthorpe don't care what I say. And I'm not camp, either. I'm a geezer. I'm not a raving queer, I've got a bit of character. I just ignore people who shout at me in the street. I just stick my head in the air; I'm not interested.
- I would rather have a cup of tea than sex.
- I've never shied away from country. 'Karma Chameleon' verges on country. Reggae and country are very closely linked. If you go to Jamaica, you hear a lot of country music. There's a correlation.
- She's probably in denial that she's a great big ball of insecurity and I'm quite well aware that I am one.
- You get much more done if you go to bed early and get up early.
- I wanted people not to care about whether you were gay, straight, black, white, transgender, whatever it may be... That being said, there's more work to be done... I still want to change the world, absolutely.
- Lots of headless chickens running around - artists with 14 million followers on Twitter, some making millions, none making cultural impact.
- What's really sad is that a lot of very talented people are being forced to do things that are very embarrassing and I don't intend to be one of them.
