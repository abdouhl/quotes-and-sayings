quotes = ['''I like turning heads and making people believers.''' ,'''I've always been a guy who shows up.''' ,'''The reason why I'm just 'Cage' in Lucha Underground instead of 'Brian Cage' is because DJ, the writer, Chris DeJoseph, we wanted to keep my name the same.''' ,'''You're not going to be selling a lot of merchandise if you are losing all your matches.''' ,'''I felt like I looked like a star from the get-go and worked pretty well. I feel like even when I was in developmental with WWE they never saw me as a star, so I would always have to put everyone over.''' ,'''When I first started getting into wrestling, the three people I wanted to be like were the three Chrises: Chris Kanyon, Chris Jericho and Chris Benoit.''' ,'''When I graduated high school, I was 150 pounds. When I first started wrestling, with the independents in California, every company is going to have guys, or in better shape. While I had gotten bigger, I was still only about 205, so I wasn't huge.''' ,'''Based on paper, because of my size, a lot of promoters and hole-in-the-wall indies will book me against the local big guy.''' ,'''People say wins and losses don't' matter. Yeah, they kind of do in a way because Hulk Hogan wouldn't have been Hulk Hogan had he lost all his matches.''' ,'''At the very least, I want to be remembered as the most unique or one of a kind X Division Champion, who isn't comparable to anyone else.''' ,'''My all time dream match has always been AJ Styles.''' ,'''Like AEW, it kind of feels like they're treating you like a professional athlete, and Lucha Underground is like a lot of TV production stuff. It felt like they treated you like a professional actor. The treatment was just above that for a wrestler.''' ,'''I told everyone through high school and junior High I guarantee by time 24, I'll be signed with WWE, and that's exactly what happened. I didn't go on to main even WrestleMania obviously, but the whole WWE accomplishment was checked off, and I got to experience that and it's cool.''' ,'''To me, the X Division has been the core of Impact, and my all-time dream match is AJ Styles, and he was one of the pioneers of the X Division.''' ,'''Even though I accomplished the whole WWE thing, which I feel like was everybody's dream when you were growing up, but it wasn't until I got to Lucha Underground that I felt how I thought I'd feel at 10 years old to be a pro wrestler.''' ,'''When I started out, I wasn't a big guy either. I got into bodybuilding just by working out, and starting a fascination with it.''' ,'''If you don't want to be number one, then I don't know what you are striving for.''' ,'''Unfortunately, I'd be put over Ryback because, like, as a better worker, but I'm like, I don't want more of a comparison because I'm wearing a singlet as well, but that's what they went with and a lot of people like that.''' ,'''I've always been a fan of the X Division and I always wanted to be a part of it.''' ,]
