- I loved plays in school.
- I think that if you can work and travel, that is the best deal you can strike.
- Film acting is so different from theatre acting, and TV is about letting things pay off and not winning every scene.
- For me, Domhnall is an acting teacher as much as anything. If I turn out to be half the actor he is, I'll be happy.
- For me, you have to do as much work as you can beforehand and, once you get on stage or set, throw it out the window because you need to be collaborative. You shouldn't have too many ideas about where it goes before you get into the room with the director and other actors.
- I loved 'Lord of the Rings,' growing up, so I always wanted to play a wizard with a staff.
- I'm crazy in how boring I am.
- Channel 4 always do really great stuff; they do great comedies.
- Like 'Love/Hate,' maybe 'Taken Down' can get people talking as well.
- Initially, I resisted going into acting. You want to have your own identity, and I thought about doing other things, but that didn't last very long.
- I was impressed that when it came to making 'Rebellion,' they sought out Aku Louhimies, a Finnish director who's part of that new wave of Scandinavian realist drama.
- I have a bit of a temper.
- My father is an actor as well, so I used to look to him.
- America's very refreshing when you go over there; they're all just open about what they want, and they want you to be open, too.
- I've led a very middle-class, very boring kind of life.
- I had always enjoyed playing characters and dressing up, but it wasn't until I got to school and I started getting on stage for plays that I got the bug.
- The global capitalist project, which we are all a part of, leaves people behind. I don't know what the answers are - I don't think any actor does - but figuring it out through entertainment can be very useful.
- Acting is probably what I'm best at, but there are certain stories kind of rattling around in my head that I like the idea of developing over time.
- I was always goofing around. I suppose having a father who was an actor made you think that it was a real possibility as a career.
- There's a lot of Irish in London and have been for years - they're very much a part of the city.
- There's no problem with trying to be successful, but it's all about just doing good work. It's not about fame.
- 'Love/Hate' was a milestone in terms of working on something at home that felt very special.
- I'm sure there's some sort of cynicism or fatalism in Ireland and England. We are fatalistic here, and sometimes we need to be shaken out of that.
