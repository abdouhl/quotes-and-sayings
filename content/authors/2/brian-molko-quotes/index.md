quotes = ['''A lot of what has pushed me forward is desire, and I have expressed that in my songwriting - perhaps because it's safer!''' ,'''The extreme side of my personality, which I chose to sort of display, was snowballing and getting a life of its own. It was like looking in a mirror and not recognising myself.''' ,'''I'm a weirdo magnet, but I'm handling it better than I used to.''' ,'''Imitation is the highest form of flattery, but clones kind of get it wrong because we are promoting individuality and being proud of being yourself.''' ,'''We live in a strange bubble.''' ,'''Dresses, I find, are impractical in social situations, but I enjoy wearing them a great deal on stage.''' ,'''The more you'll dress up the more fun you'll have.''' ,'''I feel very comfortable with the way I look, and I feel very comfortable with the kind of confusion that it creates in people's minds.''' ,'''I'd be interested in finding out if there is a light you walk into, and if you do meet people from your life and walk hand in hand with Jesus. I would hate for my death to be tragic: I'd like to be old when it happens. But hopefully a young death is unlikely.''' ,'''I used to fly off the handle in everyday life, but I'm a little calmer now.''' ,'''Being so honest in my writing is cathartic.''' ,'''I'm tired of being around men all the time. I'm going to start a band called Skirt with three girls and I'll play the guitar and sing backing vocals in drag. I went window shopping when I was in New York, saw a lot of amazing dresses.''' ,'''Music is about expressing things you can't in everyday life.''' ,'''I've always found music that is carnal very attractive but not in the most obvious way.''' ,'''Placebo is music for outsiders, by outsiders and our gigs are like conventions of outcasts, which is cool.''' ,'''I refuse to be held responsible for bringing back a wave of pasty-faced people into the world.''' ,'''I believe very strongly that when it comes to desire, when it comes to attraction, that things are never black and white, things are very much shades of grey.''' ,'''There's a hell of a lot of freedom in this rock and roll circus... it's where all the freaks go - it's the environment for me.''' ,'''So, then you find yourself in a situation where you have to do things because they're on offer to you, because you don't have much self-respect left. You just can't say no, even to something that you've never done before. You just can't help yourself.''' ,'''I guess the line between being paranoid and being a rock star is smaller than one would expect.''' ,'''My mouth has a tendency to get me into trouble, but because I'm so small and I take on people who are lager than me. If someone punched me, I'd get my drummer beat them up.''' ,'''I had a great deal of arrogance and a great deal of bravado, but I think the bravado was brought on by a huge insecurity.''' ,'''I love being a freak. It's great!''' ,]
