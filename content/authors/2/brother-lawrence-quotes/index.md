quotes = ['''It is enough for me to pick up but a straw from the ground for the love of God.''' ,'''Men invent means and methods of coming at God's love, they learn rules and set up devices to remind them of that love, and it seems like a world of trouble to bring oneself into the consciousness of God's presence. Yet it might be so simple.
