quotes = ['''Right now my favorite book is 'Omnivores Dilemma.'''' ,'''I think I have experience in rowing, and that has given me some ability to go about racing. I'm lucky genetically. I have a good VO2 max - I can hold a lot of air in my lungs - and that definitely helps.''' ,'''In rowing, you're always striving for that perfect stroke, that repetition, each one being as good as the last.

I'd be really lost.''' ,'''There's way more pressure cooking for cooks than rowing at the Olympics.''' ,'''I'm not disappointed with bronze. It's always good to come away with a medal.''' ,'''I'm very competitive, but I know when not to be competitive. I know how to have fun, but I know when it's time to get serious.
