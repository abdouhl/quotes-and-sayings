- I'm first-generation American - my people came over on boats - and I think it's a shame to close the door on people who really need freedom.
- I worked with Harold Pinter once as my first Broadway show. It was one of the most exciting things that ever happened to me.
- After I finished school, I headed for Los Angeles, thinking, 'Movies. Beaches.' But I wanted to do serious stage work, so I upped sticks and moved to New York to study.
