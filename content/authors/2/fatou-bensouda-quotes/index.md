- What offends me the most when I hear criticisms about this so-called Africa bias is how quick we are to focus on the words and propaganda of a few powerful, influential individuals, and to forget about the millions of anonymous people who suffer from their crimes.
- I am an African and I am very proud of that.
- We say that the ICC is targeting Africans, but all of the victims in our cases in Africa are African victims.
- I am a victim-oriented person. I like to see that the victims know that they have a voice.
- I do not think that it is right for me to start giving opinions about the human rights situation of any country, including Gambia, except when those crimes translate into the crimes that I have to investigate.
- I think my track record speaks for myself... I have been endorsed by the African Union, but I am a prosecutor for 121 states parties and this is what I intend to be until the end of my mandate.
