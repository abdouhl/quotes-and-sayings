- Being able to hear an artist and emulate them has been a huge part of being successful as a producer and co-writer. I think it's a problem when a producer comes in to work with an artist, and you can't hear the artist as well anymore. It's very important to me to be invisible.
- To me, my favorite joke on a stand-up special is when someone says something and you go, 'Oh my God, I've been thinking that my whole life, I've just never said it to anyone else.' Those little kinda quiet, personal observations you make that nobody else has talked about yet.
- I had a very positive, wonderful, happy upbringing, and still, for several reasons, I really didn't enjoy being a child very much. I felt that I had no control over my life and everything seemed scarier and larger than life.
- For me, I'm going to try to make my favorite song over the most popular song.
- I try not to shy away from specificity.
- Well, predominately, if I'm writing for another artist, I'm sitting there with them and we're writing it together.
- I'm a big believer in the benefit of a home studio. You're sitting there and maybe you don't know the next line. So you go outside for a second, maybe. Make a sandwich. Play with the dog. Or watch an episode of 'The Office,' whatever. And then it clicks, you run back into the room, and you've got it. It's not like your creativity is on the clock.
- Usually, I get bored of my stuff almost immediately.
- Everything sounds better when Billie sings it, so the only ones I'll keep for myself are ones that really feel just super personal to me in their content, like this is my life story and maybe not anybody else's.
- You go to a truck stop and there are key chains with names on them, and there's no Finneas. There's no Billie. They're little things, but as a kid, you just feel weirdly ostracized.
- I don't analyze songs because I think it will make me a better songwriter, I just do it out of sheer curiosity.
- If you're thinking about all the possibilities of your life, there are extreme negatives, which you hope don't happen, and extreme positives, which you just aren't willing to think about because you think you'll jinx it.
- The amount of times I've been told something by artists I'm working with, which I'm sure they haven't told even their significant other or families, is shocking.
- I think we're always looking for ways to inject a sense of humor into our music.
- People don't come to see a Billie Eilish show to come to see me. They come to see her. So I just try not to screw up too much on my instruments.
- I have always loved Ben Folds, he's like an idol of mine, a hero of mine.
- I don't really have any interest in recording at places that are institutionalized for recording.
- I never get tired of writing about love.
- Working on TV shows was fun, but I felt crazy pressured and stressed.
- You know, I grew up very self-taught.
- I usually don't like to annoy people in asking to work with them.
- Our mom cooks well, and we cook poorly. We try.
- You know, that's kind of always been our philosophy: not letting the place that we are get in the way of making great music.
- If I have experienced something in my life, it's probably going to be written about, and I don't particularly care if the person I'm writing about wants to be written about.
- I love pop songs so much and I don't put a ton of pressure on myself as a solo artist to always write the most commercial feeling thing, I just want to write things I would love to listen to.
- We wrote and recorded the 'Bond' song on a tour bus in Texas.
- I stopped telling people what lyrics meant to them when I saw them tattoo it on them, because it clearly meant much more to them than it ever did to me.
- In my perfect world, I get to be a professional musician and still go to Trader Joe's.
- I think in modern communication studies, we put a lot of emphasis on our relationships and our family relationships. Our relationships with our parents, and our siblings. I felt that there was this gap in content about communication with people who are super close to you in your peer group.
- I just have no interest in being at a party.
- I don't particularly like recording studios, they tend to be lifeless and without any natural light, so I wanted to record wherever we lived. We just don't want to be bound to a studio to who we'd have to pay untold sums to.
- Billie doesn't actually like recording sessions at all. We like making music together. She doesn't like going to some big studio and having them pretend to be a therapist for a couple hours. So by default, we always make the good stuff together.
- I'm not a control freak in that like I boss everybody around, but like a control freak and like, I like knowing exactly what I get to do that day and having a say.
- I feel like the thing that I've learned a lot is when you're involved in something, you don't always get to appreciate it for what it is as much. You're focused on the details and how you can make it better. It's kind of torture.
- It's always important to be checking in with people you love.
- Production has always been a fantasy of mine, and I got really lucky and had a sister who put a lot of faith and trust in me, and was very collaborative, and was willing to let me produce her entire album.
- I think the whole response to our art being so positive is that it rings true and it feels a unique thing and I feel that was the thing that we strive for in the beginning was to not conform to any preconceived notions of what we should be doing.
- When I started, I felt that there was this incredible amount of doubt of my ability as a producer.
- I really always wanted to be an adult. I didn't really like being an adolescent at all.
- To be honest, I've found so many more friends in the music industry than people I disagree with. I certainly haven't been made to feel like an outsider.
- My feeling is that everybody starts out as an emulator. You follow their approach and that's how learning works. The pivot is that I don't think you're going to break new ground unless you do something different.
- What I really didn't want to do is work with other people and have them go, 'Oh, Finneas just does that sound for everybody.' The Billie sound is only Billie - I'll only do that for her.
- Imagine if somebody was like, 'Who's the next Timothee Chalamet?' It's like, he's currently Timothee Chalamet.
- I think that's probably the number one reason why collaboration is good. You disagree with each other about things and then what we always say is whichever one of us is more passionate about the issue is the winner because if you care about something enough to fight for it, that means it's probably a good thing.
- I'm not very interested in fame or notoriety at all - in fact, I'd be pretty bummed out if I woke up one day and I was, like, super, super famous. But the flipside of that is that I'm really passionate about my music, I'm really proud of it and I want it to be heard by as many people as possible, and I'm willing to embrace whatever comes with that.
- All my favorite songs ever are love songs. Probably topped by 'The Luckiest' by Ben Folds.
- I find that when I'm in an argument and I'm angry, I can't even form a sentence well. You say something and then later you're like 'That's not even what I meant at all!'
- If you need to record live instruments, especially drums, it's still best to do it in a studio.
- I remember, one time, my dad took me and Billie to a fair. I was probably 7 years old, Billie must have been 3, and she put footie pyjamas on and then put a second pair of underwear on over the pyjamas. I remember being like, 'What is Billie wearing?!' and my dad was like, 'She's happy with it. Let's go!'
- I always wanted to be on tour or making albums.
- You might think of Hollywood as this full-on glamorous thing and to us it was like, 'All right, mom's got an audition. Do you want to sit in traffic for 50 minutes and go in with her?'
- The way that we tried to approach every piece of music is, if the song had a brain, it would be aware of its catalog.
- If you can use songs as a tool, vehicle for empathy and a deeper understanding of how people are feeling and how people's emotions work, there's a lot of good that can come from that.
- When we are making a song for Billie I want it to resonate and speak the truth with her and want it to be a piece of fabric she can wear.
- I feel like you're able to be your most creative in private environments, and not a studio where an A&R person is coming in, telling us a song isn't a smash.
- The first time I ever heard Airborne Toxic Event, my friend was turning 11 or something. And he had a paintball birthday party where him and me and two of our other friends went out to these paintball courses and I got obliterated. I don't think I got one hit.
- I've learned a lot from my mom and my dad. I learn a lot every time I watch Billie perform.
- I felt really lucky in that I've gotten to know some of my favorite artists; I get to tell them how important they are to me. But that doesn't always make me want to work with people. I feel like if I'm going to work with somebody, it's because I feel like I actually have something to add to them.
- There's always a better word than a swear word.
- I was on a TV show called 'Glee.' I mean, I was on the real tail end of that show; it was already way past its peak. But still, for me aged 17 landing something like that was a big deal.
- It's important to recognize when a song remains important to you.
- The excuse of having a dog is great, because before I had a dog, I wouldn't be like, 'I need to go hike for two hours'; my girlfriend would have been like, 'What are you doing?' Now I take the dog, and she comes with me.
- All the albums that I grew up listening to were produced by one person.
- I have nothing against reverb.
- If I'm making a song with Billie, then it's for Billie... She has to want to wear that song every day. And I think I try to do the same thing when I'm making a song for myself... I try to treat them both that way, like I'm sort of A&R-ing her and then A&R-ing myself.
- In the alternate reality where I wasn't involved at all, and I'd been like, just, sweating my way through, trying to have a music career for years? And then my sibling had one and I wasn't involved at all? I think I'd be very tortured by it. But the fact that we've had one in tandem makes a lot of sense.
- I came to NAMM once and saw this guitar that self-tuned, and I thought, 'Wow, this is the future!' And I've never seen it again.
- So, I'll walk around with - just an iPhone will work - but sometimes I'll bring, like, a little mobile recorder and I'll just, like, if hear an interesting sound, I'll just record it. And then later, I'll listen through them and I'll go like, 'I wonder how can I use that?'
- Well, I mean there are so many producers that inspire me. I used to try to imitate production by certain people. And now I'm only interested in doing the opposite of that. I'm only interested in doing production that like no one's ever done before.
- A lot of the time, in pop music especially, there's reverb. And the reason is that reverb makes vocals sound better 99% of the time. It makes the notes ring out.
- I really value just being able to go out and grab a coffee or going to a movie and not have anyone recognize me.
- I think if you're not trying to change things a little bit, you're not evolving.
- Love has always been the most important thing to me and the thing by which my life is guided.
- To me, as a producer, I always want something to set stuff apart.
- Kids have tools to do what I'm doing.
- If I'm writing with or for someone else, it just has to feel true and real for them. It has to feel like they're being honest. If it's for myself, it's the same thing. It has to be something I can mean when I say it.
- I'm just obsessed with music I guess.
- I feel like a lot of music producers have, like, the same toolbox. And I think, like, to me, as a producer, like, I want something to set my stuff apart.
- I mainly try to foster long-term collaborative relationships.
- The music that I listened to when I was growing up was the most important to me forever.
- I love Griffith Park.
- I'm a bad guitar tuner. I have to pay somebody to tune my guitars.
- I think that, for us, the thing that no one can take away from you is that if you make something that they've never heard before, they're gonna respond to that. They may not love it, it may not be their favourite thing, but no one can take different from you.
- I idolize my kid sister, so I get it. I understand why other people do too.
- Everybody has different taste and everyone's favourite song is different and that's great.
- If you're paying attention and you've been a good listener, you learn every day.
- Even though we're all together making songs and I produce them, it's so her vision. Especially when we walk out on stage every night. It's so meticulously thought through by Billie and I admire that endlessly in her.
- People were like, 'he's collaborating with Taylor Swift' and I was like, 'I am?' I think she's wonderful. Her songwriting has inspired me for years.
- I am just fascinated by music and I want to know how to identify all the things I love about it; to me music theory is like learning another language and then being able to explain how much you love something more clearly.
- Definitely for me and my sister, wherever we are the most comfortable is where the best music's going to be made.
- As soon as you make anything that people like, you get all these new artists hitting you up like 'I want to sound just like Billie Eilish.' And I'm always like, 'Absolutely not.'
- My dreams as a kid were so far below the Grammys, like, maybe selling out a show, or, like, seeing your album on a shelf in an Urban Outfitters... and the Grammys are so far above that. It's very ridiculous.
- I think it's really easy to be the altruistic hero of your own narrative and story.
- I am not a very superstitious person, but I do believe in mental preparation.
- We were a very crunchy, sort of hippie-dippy family.
- I don't think if you set out to make an album to get a bunch of Grammy nominations... you just have to set out to make an album you'll really love.
- When I wrote 'When the Party's Over,' it had a universal quality.
- There's no other person I like working with as much as my sister.
- Obviously I'm very grateful 'Bad Guy' is doing so well - it's shocking and surprising and gratifying - but I do think it's important to try to make the next song that people are gonna be excited about.
- I'm not an author, but as a songwriter, I'm afforded this kind of luxurious ambiguity in songs of being able to confess the secrets of my relationships with people and face basically no consequences, or ask for no approval or permission.
