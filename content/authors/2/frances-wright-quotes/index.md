- But while human liberty has engaged the attention of the enlightened, and enlisted the feelings of the generous of all civilized nations, may we not enquire if this liberty has been rightly understood?

- Instead of establishing facts, we have to overthrow errors; instead of ascertaining what is, we have to chase from our imaginations what is not.

- We have seen that no religion stands on the basis of things known; none bounds its horizon within the field of human observation; and, therefore, as it can never present us with indisputable facts, so must it ever be at once a source of error and contention.
- The hired preachers of all sects, creeds, and religions, never do, and never can, teach any thing but what is in conformity with the opinions of those who pay them.
- If they exert it not for good, they will for evil; if they advance not knowledge, they will perpetuate ignorance.

- Religion may be defined thus: a belief in, and homage rendered to, existences unseen and causes unknown.
- A necessary consequent of religious belief is the attaching ideas of merit to that belief, and of demerit to its absence.
- Equality is the soul of liberty; there is, in fact, no liberty without it.
- These will vary in every human being; but knowledge is the same for every mind, and every mind may and ought to be trained to receive it.

- How are men to be secured in any rights without instruction; how to be secured in the equal exercise of those rights without equality of instruction? By instruction understand me to mean knowledge - just knowledge; not talent, not genius, not inventive mental powers.
- All that I say is, examine, inquire. Look into the nature of things. Search out the grounds of your opinions, the for and against. Know why you believe, understand what you believe, and possess a reason for the faith that is in you.
- Know why you believe, understand what you believe, and possess a reason for the faith that is in you.
- Let us unite on the safe and sure ground of fact and experiment, and we can never err; yet better, we can never differ.
