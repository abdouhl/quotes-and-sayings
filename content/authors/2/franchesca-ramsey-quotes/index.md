Similarly, I started creating comedy content and doing characters and talking about things that were important to me because I didn't find a place to do that in the career that I wanted as an actress.''' ,'''For me, at least with my parents, I feel that they wanted me to have all the opportunities that they did not have, and for them, that meant going to private school.''' ,'''Self-esteem doesn't have to just be about the way you look; it can be about your talents and passions.

But if I don't know you, and you just reach out and touch me without asking or touch while simultaneously asking, I'm going to give you a side eye.''' ,'''I'm very self-deprecating, so I'm not afraid to make jokes at my own expense, and I've just found that makes people a little more comfortable and can open the door for people to feel a little bit more understanding and accepting of where you're coming from.''' ,'''I left acting school really hoping that I could be on a television show of some sort, working in movies in Hollywood.''' ,'''I don't want to tell anybody who to vote for; I'd rather people just do their homework and make sure they vote for the person that they feel like is best to run our country.''' ,'''The Internet is an actual dumpster fire.''' ,'''I think that if you stay positive and remain positive, you can definitely achieve the things you set out to.''' ,'''Black women come with all sorts of personalities.

Our voices are powerful and have the ability to make change.''' ,'''I think the beauty of the Internet is that it's giving a lot of people the opportunity to reach people around the world that they never would have been able to, and for people to tell their own stories where they don't see themselves reflected in mainstream media, or the media is misrepresenting the truth, right.''' ,'''For a black activist, for an activist of all walks of life, the Internet has become this kind of meeting place where we can exchange ideas, where we can learn from each other, where we can get inspired about new ways that we can make changes within our own communities and own homes.''' ,]
