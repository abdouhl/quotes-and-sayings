Sometimes characters will come into the story that I haven't planned.''' ,'''Well, I always wanted to write from the time I was very little, and my mother encouraged me. She wrote a journal from the time she was 15 up until about the age of 76.''' ,'''I actually worked in the general market for many years writing steamy historical romance, and I had more freedom in the Christian market than I ever did in the general market to write about any issue that I needed to write about.''' ,'''I want to see Christian fiction speak to the hard and real issues that tear people's lives apart.''' ,'''That is one of the reasons I write: to feel the Presence of God and know He is speaking to me in a very personal way, instructing me, correcting me, redirecting me.''' ,'''My favorite book is 'Redeeming Love.' It was my first as a born-again Christian, my statement of faith, and the most exciting year I've spent writing anything.''' ,'''I start work by spending time in personal Bible study. Because my projects center on a question in my own faith walk, I find Bible study essential. And God gives me scriptures daily that speak to the question with which I'm struggling.''' ,'''When we love like Jesus does, lives change for the better.''' ,'''Like everyone else, there are days when I don't want to go to work. However, writing is a job like anything else.''' ,'''I became a Christian late, in my late 30s, so I had a lot of things that I was bringing into my Christian life that I regret. And I had a lot of questions about faith, so that's where I start when I write.''' ,'''I'll often dream about characters before I start writing their stories.''' ,'''I had been raised in the church, but I wasn't a Christian. I had a lot of head knowledge but no heart knowledge.''' ,]
