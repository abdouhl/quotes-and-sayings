- After Proust, there are certain things that simply cannot be done again. He marks off for you the boundaries of your talent.
- Of course the illusion of art is to make one believe that great literature is very close to life, but exactly the opposite is true. Life is amorphous, literature is formal.
- Writing is a question of finding a certain rhythm. I compare it to the rhythms of jazz. Much of the time life is a sort of rhythmic progression of three characters. If one tells oneself that life is like that, one feels it less arbitrary.
- To jealousy, nothing is more frightful than laughter.
- One can never speak enough of the virtues, the dangers, the power of shared laughter.
- I've tried very hard and I've never found any resemblance between the people I know and the people in my novels.
- The one thing I regret is that I will never have time to read all the books I want to read.
- Much of the time life is a sort of rhythmic progression of three characters. If one tells oneself that life is like that, one feels it less arbitrary.
- Jazz music is an intensified feeling of nonchalance.
- It would be bad form for me to describe people I don't know and don't understand.
- I always believe things are going to work out.
- Marriage? It's like asparagus eaten with vinaigrette or hollandaise, a matter of taste but of no importance.
- Every time I see a film about Joan of Arc I'm convinced she'll get away with it. It's the only way to get through life.
- Art must take reality by surprise.
- You should celebrate the end of a love affair as they celebrate death in New Orleans, with songs, laughter, dancing and a lot of wine.
- A dress makes no sense unless it inspires men to take it off of you.
- I've read Proust and Stendhal. That keeps you in your place.
- I dreamt of being a writer once I started to read. I started to write 'Bonjour Tristesse' in bistros around the Sorbonne. I finished it, I sent it to editors. It was accepted.
- All my life, I will continue obstinately to write about love, solitude and passion among the kind of people I know. The rest don't interest me.
- It seems to me that there are two kinds of trickery: the 'fronts' people assume before one another's eyes, and the 'front' a writer puts on the face of reality.
- For me writing is a question of finding a certain rhythm. I compare it to the rhythms of jazz.
- Every little girl knows about love. It is only her capacity to suffer because of it that increases.
- I had a strong desire to write and some free time.
