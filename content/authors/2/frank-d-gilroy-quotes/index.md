quotes = ['''I don't believe in updating. If a play works, it draws something from being true to its time.''' ,'''You're looking at a guy who has no reason to complain about anything.''' ,'''You reach a time... when fact and fiction blend seamlessly. If you do it too soon, it's journalism. If you do it too late, you forget, and it's fantasy. There's an optimum time.''' ,'''The way plays happen, at least with me, it's spontaneous combustion of things you've had in your head.''' ,'''I think of myself as a storyteller.''' ,'''I remember how I would wait for a play idea. I wasted a tremendous amount of time. I didn't realize that ideas could be made into movies or novels.''' ,'''I'd like to walk into a room sometime and be introduced as the author of something other than that play. There's always one thing in a career that has more impact than anything else. In my case, 'The Subject Was Roses' was that thing.''' ,'''Young men who have been away, been to war, they are different when they come home.''' ,]
