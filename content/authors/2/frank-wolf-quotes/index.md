As such it should feature prominently in U.S. foreign policy.''' ,'''When you see people suffering and dying and hungry, this job gives you the ability to do something about it.''' ,'''My hope and prayer is that the body of Christ in America will awake with holy boldness, a boldness content neither with silence nor mere words but that backs up those words with action and results.''' ,'''Scripture makes it clear to me that there is an obligation to speak out on behalf of those being persecuted.''' ,'''I am compelled, because of my faith, to have compassion for the weak and vulnerable in our midst.''' ,]
