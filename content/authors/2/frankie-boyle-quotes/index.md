quotes = ['''The Tories have been offering us a cocktail of incompetence and malice and Labour haven't done anything to draw attention to it. It's been like watching Mesut Ozil drop perfect crosses on to the head of an increasingly frustrated Stephen Hawking.''' ,'''If leadership is about listening, the great political speeches would have been a little different.''' ,'''If you're an activist trying to do something important, I salute you. Most of us just give ourselves ethical brownie points for watching Channel 2 instead of Channel 3, like characters in a broad dystopian satire.''' ,'''Trump divides his time between working some kind of 'King Ralph' angle, and claiming that he's going to make the U.S. great again by using his business experience. We can only assume that means repeatedly declaring it bankrupt, then changing its name so he can just shake off all the debt.''' ,'''I'm totally off any caffeine now.''' ,'''I think you have a lot of rich and Conservative people who control our country who are racist and their views trickle down through things like tabloid papers.''' ,'''I think we live in a quite an immoral society with quite an amoral government and they're going to have to grow up in that and negotiate their own way in it.''' ,'''I think there is racism at the heart of British policy and has been both in Labour and Conservative times.''' ,'''I did a ski festival in Austria once. I was struck by how friendly Austrians were, before gradually realising it's more that Glaswegians are awful.''' ,'''The thing that nobody really said about Rebecca Adlington is that she looks pretty weird. She looks like someone who's looking at themselves in the back of a spoon.''' ,'''I don't believe I'm a recovering alcoholic - I'm someone who used to drink. AA comes from a religious movement and that whole thing of 'I'm always burdened with this' and the original sin idea. It's not like that for me.''' ,'''I read tons of comic books. My favourite is Grant Morrison, a Scottish comic writer.''' ,'''Remember, taboos are just a map of what a society feels it's acceptable to be neurotic about. Taboos aren't rational.''' ,'''You can actually make your own Trump policies by going through the incinerator at the Daily Mail and picking through the dust for anything they thought might get them prosecuted.''' ,'''Internationally, I propose the radical step of not trying to solve complex political problems with 1,000lb bombs; domestically, I propose they start addressing inequality by paying reparations for slavery. I'm well aware that in a society where war and discrimination are now almost entirely normalised, both options sound like madness.''' ,'''Creationists have often made me doubt evolution, but probably not in the way they think.''' ,'''There's still a lot of racism in stand-up.''' ,'''I've been studying Israeli army martial arts. I now know 16 ways to kick a Palestinian woman in the back.''' ,'''The SNP are far from radical, but they do have a knack for producing the odd simple, progressive policy that's hard to argue against.''' ,'''I went through a brief phase years ago of getting Men's Health then I realised there are actually only three ways to do a sit-up and they're just repackaging it endlessly.''' ,'''I can make a joke pointing out that David Cameron told off Sri Lanka for human rights abuses committed with weapons Britain sold it - like Ronald McDonald calling you a fat bastard.''' ,'''Supporting Celtic, waving a tricolour because your parents are Irish - that's a valid culture.''' ,'''I'm not Russell Brand or Ricky Gervais, but I have enough money that I don't have to work. Most people who've done what I do don't have that.''' ,'''I've said jokes where I thought people might get up and hit me for this. A couple of people have thought about it. But they didn't. It gives you a lot of power, because if you're on shows where people are worried about getting sacked and you're not, then you're transcendent because you say what other people would like to say.''' ,'''In times of crisis, we are made to feel we should scrutinise our government's actions less closely, when surely that's when we should pay closest attention.''' ,'''Islamic State practise a brand of Islamic law so strict that apparently Raqqa only has two Irish Pubs.''' ,'''I'm not cynical at all.''' ,'''Our attitudes are fostered by a society built on ideas of dominance, where the solution to crises are force and action, rather than reflection and compromise.''' ,'''There's been a thread of coverage implying that Corbyn is a decent guy but he clearly doesn't understand how the world works. Ignoring the fact that for the majority of people, it doesn't.''' ,'''I don't think I'm angry. I'm horrified - powered by horror.''' ,'''There are many indicators of advanced civilisations, but unthinking hero worship of the military isn't one of them.''' ,'''I worry about everything in this country in particular.''' ,'''I think the most important things my book does is to give readers the address of George Monbiot's website and how to get hold of comic books by Grant Morrison.''' ,'''Comedy is a terrible way to meet women. It's certainly a way to start talking to them, but they always have preconceptions about you.''' ,'''If I ever get to meet Vladimir Putin, I will probably take my top off and challenge him to an erotically charged wrestling match, which I will let him win.''' ,'''Somehow, I always imagine that Trump spends the evenings with his forehead pressed against the cold glass of an aquarium, talking telepathically to the tormented albino squid in which he has hidden his soul.''' ,'''The truth is that modern governments sit at the head of a well-funded security apparatus. They are told that foreign military adventures put domestic populations at risk and they give them the thumbs up anyway.''' ,'''The average British person would hear me doing my joke about Rebecca Adlington and realise there's no malice in it. It was an off-the-cuff ad lib.''' ,'''For anyone who has ever asked why the U.S. needs to address the issue of reparations for its history of slavery, Donald Trump is why. He is the living embodiment of America's unresolved issues.''' ,'''Supporting Rangers, being in an Orange Lodge, that whole life - that's a valid culture.''' ,'''Consumer culture needs us to be impulsive, while our political culture fears that we will ever develop discipline.''' ,'''People internalise marketing.''' ,'''Let's not forget that the essential message of a Republican candidate is a tricky sell. That you love America, but hate all the groups that make up America. That you love democracy, but hate people.''' ,'''I'm actually all for political correctness. If you want to work to change the usage of a word that's discriminatory then fine, I'm behind you. But that's a conversation that needs to be had in the culture. You can't just decide that commonly used parts of a language are evil and that the people who didn't get the memo must be bad people.''' ,'''I want to be a part of a vibrant culture and have a more open culture.''' ,'''It's always easier to dismiss other people than to go through the awkward and time consuming process of understanding them.''' ,'''Trump's one liberal policy seems to be his desire to pump more funding into mental health - which I've taken the liberty of interpreting as a massive cry for help.''' ,'''If you feel more emotion looking at a picture of queuing lorries than a picture of desperate humans living in a lay-by, you need to check your bedtime routine for someone beating you round the head with a meat tenderiser.''' ,'''I loved the idea of Bowie as an artist, with his Burroughsian cut-up technique, creating these undecipherable, abstract songs, where we all projected our own meanings onto his jarring word choices and unexpected chord changes.''' ,'''The No 1 priority in TV comedy today is 'don't frighten the horses,' and it's probably No 2 and 3 as well.''' ,'''I have some friends who are comedians but not many.''' ,'''Doug Stanhope is great - I saw his 'Burning the Bridge to Nowhere' show and it was inspiring. He's like an anti-shaman, taking the sting out of a bunch of things we've chosen to give a symbolic power to. I've made it sound noble and worthy there, it's not, it's really funny.''' ,'''Only the British could experience great pain at the thought of a traffic jam - a place where you can sit alone with your radio on without being expected to do any work. Aren't traffic jams unbearable? By the time you get home, you need to sit alone in a comfy chair with your favourite music on just to calm down.''' ,'''That's what I do in my stand-up. I work hard and hone the material and after a while audiences expect what I do to be good.''' ,'''America has gone from the Obama Years to the Trump Years, like going from the 'West Wing' to a sitcom where the incidental music involves a tuba.''' ,'''A lot of racism comes from projection. White Americans have a stereotype of black people being criminals purely because they can't acknowledge that it was actually white people that stole them from Africa in the first place.''' ,'''There is no doubt I have offended many people. No doubt, also, that I have blasphemed. I sometimes try to offend as part of my routine - after all, the essence of humour, even in a child, is the effort to shock and surprise.''' ,'''Ed Miliband's anti-immigration stance is odd: it's hard to vote for a man who doesn't have the confidence to defend his own existence.''' ,'''I've never felt any sense of kinship with other comedians; they've always seemed too needy.''' ,'''Having our privacy exposed is particularly crushing for the British - a nation for whom the phrase: 'How are you?' really means: 'Please say one word, then leave me alone.'''' ,'''How hard is it to get female panellists?''' ,'''British people have a really sophisticated sense of humour, because we're exposed to much more than Europeans and Americans, not least in our literary heritage.''' ,'''In a lot of farther-flung places in Scotland people are guarded at first, but as soon as they get to know you they really hate you.''' ,'''Admittedly, the Conservatives are generally more persuasive orators than their Labour counterparts, perhaps a skill developed by spending school holidays trying to lure father out from behind his Daily Telegraph.''' ,'''Isis want to destroy the knowledge that Islam is a beautiful, scientific and intelligent culture, and we are way ahead of them.''' ,'''I doubt anyone has ever accused comedians of solidarity before. It's hard to think of a less collegiate world than that of unabashed professional narcissists competing for attention; even when we reluctantly band together on panel shows, we're only trying to sell solo tours.''' ,'''People think that the Middle East is very complex but I have an analogy that sums it up quite well. If you imagine that Palestine is a big cake, well... that cake is being punched to pieces by a very angry Jew.''' ,'''I have no real enemies in comedy, but there are a couple of people who I'd laugh about if I heard that their legs had fallen off.''' ,'''On channels terrified of accusations of bias, or political retribution, comics making jokes about the growing power base of far-right politicians aren't taking the 'easy' route.''' ,'''They say that the older you get, the more conservative you become: perhaps that's the reason there are no Tories in Scotland.''' ,'''The Labour party has, from the beginning, been made up of diverse factions; that's its beauty - asking it to become cohesive is like trying to find one shampoo that will care for the hair of everybody in Angelina Jolie's house.''' ,'''The Conservatives have never been a party burdened by needless sentimentality; some MPs only keep their children's photos in their wallet to make sure that at the end of term they don't bring the wrong one home.''' ,'''The Internet shows me how limited my interests are - there's everything out there and I'm still looking at what the weather's going to be like in Scotland.''' ,'''If we can look at another human being and categorise them as 'illegal,' or that chilling American word 'alien,' then what has become of our own humanity?''' ,'''I just want to do something that I feel makes a difference.''' ,'''Sectarianism is a real problem, but it should be addressed by people engaging with each other - reconciliation.''' ,'''I think we live in a country that sometimes forgets how effective the rule of law is, perhaps because our governments have often found it inconvenient.''' ,'''There are a lot of problems with democracy. We need to think about how to find the people most qualified for the job.''' ,'''People hate jokes.''' ,'''In the future we will all be famous for 15 minutes. It will be on a daytime magazine programme and we will each wear a tasteful shirt and slacks combination. We'll be interviewed by a soothing voice under a clock that's permanently set to 4pm. We will talk about the weather. We will record for months to get 15 minutes they can use in the edit.''' ,'''I absolutely loathe adverts. I won't go into the cinema until 20 minutes after the film is due to start because there are so many.''' ,'''Perhaps we've got so involved in the false selves we project on social media that we've forgotten that our real selves, our private selves, are different, are worth saving.''' ,'''In my early 20s, there was a period when all I owned was about a dozen CDs and a crappy Discman. I'd listen to 'The Man Who Sold The World' album endlessly as I sat on off-peak trains jerking around the Sussex countryside to and from the asylum I worked in.''' ,'''Corbyn sounds like a dreadful town, dresses like a catalogue model for the Sue Ryder shop and won't look significantly different when he's been dead for a week.''' ,'''I love the BBC and I think it's a really important thing.''' ,'''We fear the arrival of immigrants that we have drawn here with the wealth we stole from them. For much of the rest of the world we must be the focus of bitter amusement, characters in a satire we don't understand. It is British people that don't learn languages, or British history. Britain is the true scrounger, the true criminal.''' ,'''Your ruling class don't care about what happens to you. What seems like some enormous upset in your community is undetectable from a helicopter or a speeding motorcade. They are pitiless.''' ,'''To support policies that dehumanise others is to dehumanise yourself.''' ,'''People feel much more comfortable with the 'Fifty Shades of Grey' version of women's liberation: possibly feeling life would be much simpler if the suffragettes hadn't wanted the vote and just really enjoyed chaining themselves to railings.''' ,'''Bombing Syria will achieve nothing.''' ,'''Of course, it's absurd that we trust the Tories with our day-to-day reality, as so many of them don't really inhabit it. Why elect people to run our schools and hospitals who choose not to go to those schools and hospitals?''' ,'''People are medicated and TV is one of the things that they are medicated with.''' ,'''We live in a culture built on debt, so we are encouraged to have no self control.''' ,'''We live in a country where posting 'Let's riot or something bruv!' on Facebook will get you a couple of years in prison, while writing a column saying we should bomb Syria is practically an entrance exam for public intellectuals.''' ,'''Comedians shame people.''' ,'''It is part of my job description to be offensive.''' ,'''We need to take urgent action on climate change.''' ,'''The Conservative party now exists largely to misinform the public, to convince voters struggling through austerity that they have the same interests as billionaires and corporations.''' ,'''I was drinking so much coffee and Red Bull just to keep going it screwed me.''' ,'''Of course, it's hard to get interested in the whole idea of government. Nothing ever changes, especially people saying 'nothing ever changes,' despite the fact their kid now has a free nursery place and their aunt was forced to work despite having dementia.''' ,]
