Do not look for the impossible, but do not let your path deviate from the quiet and steadfast insistence on full opportunities for your powers.''' ,'''My father had retained an emotional affection for the ceremonial of his parental home, without allowing it to influence his intellectual freedom.''' ,'''Not so the scientist. The very essence of his life is the service of truth.''' ,'''This idea was also brought out very clearly by Wallace, who emphasized that apparently reasonable activities of man might very well have developed without an actual application of reasoning.''' ,'''I hope I may have succeeded in presenting to you, however imperfectly, the currents of thought due to the work of the immortal Darwin which have helped to make anthropology what it is at the present time.''' ,]
