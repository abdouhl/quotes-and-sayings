- On every album you can see my growth.
- Differences' is the biggest song in my career. It beat 'Pony,' it beat 'So Anxious' and 'None of Ur Friends Business' as far as popularity and spins.

- I'm a firm believer when I'm doing my job to not want anybody around.
- A lot of people bit into Timbaland's sounds.
- See, every thing in show business is a lie. It ain't all it's cracked up to be.

You have to keep that in perspective and not get caught up in the hype.

- All my career I've been like a leader, and a lot of people followed what I did.
- I don't look at certain things on TV anymore. I don't listen to certain music anymore. I make sure my kids don't listen to it. It's funny because back in the days I could look at comedy shows and all kind of stuff and you didn't even realize how much cursing it had in it.
