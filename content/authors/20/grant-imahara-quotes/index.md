- There's nothing like experiencing the sights and sounds of a live robot combat event.
- The people who are changing our world are starting from an idea and bringing it all the way through to finished product with the power of their intellect, training, tools and available products.
- Walking the streets of Porto and speaking with the top engineers at Veniam, I am struck by the passion that they bring to the world with their designs.
- First career I had right out of engineering school was at Lucas film, not working in the movies but working in home theater.
- As a former competitor, robot combat is near and dear to my heart. I enjoy the mix of creativity and mayhem that are essential to this sport.
- Not only will innovative technology create a more connected human race; it will normalize access to our most basic needs.
- Everybody has stories about using duct tape. Of course, most don't try to lift a car with it.
- I hope people can envision a future where we as humans have robots that are alongside us, assisting in our daily lives.
- When you think about exploring deep space, it's very dangerous for humans. To potentially sacrifice human life is a delicate proposition. On the flip side, if you want to send a robot to another planet for an extended period of time and at some point you know it'll cease to function, it's not considered a tragedy.
- In special effects, you can cheat to make it look good. In real science, you have to have results.
- People always ask why I would leave ILM, and it's because 'Mythbusters' sounded like fun.
- What you need to have is that link between your education and what you do. Make creativity part of the subject.
- The general public perception is that fighting robots were popular, and then went away for a long time, but in reality, there have been live robot combat events happening continuously since 1994. And all the while, the robots have been getting better and meaner and tougher.
- When I used to work in special effects at the model shop, I couldn't imagine having a better job. We made spaceships and miniature cities and I was working on robots. Then the 'MythBusters' opportunity came along.
- As far as animatronics, I started out in college working for Tom Holman. He was the inventor of the THX sound system. Through him, I got an internship at Lucasfilm.
- On 'MythBusters,' a lot of what we do does not fall into any category of things we have ever done before. There's a lot of problem solving to figure out how to even approach a given problem. A background in science or engineering helps a lot.
- I wasn't in the AV club. I was the AV club.
- Engineers are great at many things. They're not necessarily great at recognizing basic human psychology.
- I never really wanted to be, I don't want to say, an average engineer. I always wanted to do something different, something more exciting.
- Working on movies and TV is a blast, and ILM has the most talented people in the world. But on 'Mythbusters' I've been able to go places I would never have access to otherwise.
- Baby Yoda is universally cute, hands down.
- When I started Battle Bots in 1999, the guy sitting next to me was a high school teacher with no robotics experience at all. There were special effects guys, engineers, software guys who just wrote code - all kinds of people who had a desire to build something. And they would do it in their garages or even their kitchens.
- I love looking at machines that mimic human behavior.
- I always wanted to have a technical career that was also creative. I have been extremely lucky in that sense to be able to combine those two things.
- Human communication above and beyond the words that we say is so nuanced. It makes it difficult to not only analyze the vocabulary you use but the intention behind it. That's something even humans have difficulty doing, let alone a robot.
- I've seen how they make the Chicken McNuggets and exactly what goes into them.
- I think it's something you're born with - the desire to know how things work inside.
- When I was a kid, I never wanted to be James Bond. I wanted to be Q, because he was the guy who made all the gadgets. I guess you could say that engineering came naturally.
- I remember when I was a kid and I was interested in robots, there was really nothing out there but Erector Sets and Tinker Toys.
- After the third episode of 'The Mandalorian,' I knew I had to make my own Baby Yoda.

- Life in space isn't easy. It's full of challenges that push the limits of technology, and often requires truly innovative solutions.
- Unfortunately, making what is essentially a laser sword falls into the deadly category.
- I only learned what an engineer was from a college guidance counselor. When she described it, a light clicked on in my head, and I said, 'Yes, that's what I want to do.'
- In the '60s astronauts were rockstars. Everyone wanted to be an astronaut.
- Any sport that turns a squash into a lethal projectile is safest watched from the comfort of your couch.
- Drones, with their agility and small size, seem perfect for search and rescue operations.
- I was one of those kids that would take apart the remote control and take all the wheels off my little toy cars.
- Contrary to popular belief, not a significant amount of research goes into cockroach radiation.
- Augmented and virtual reality technologies are the future of smart construction and we are just starting to see the possibilities.
- Technology has always been a catalyst for change, such as the invention of the airplane or the Internet.
- I liked the challenge of designing and building things, figuring out how something works and how to make it better or apply it in a different way.
- 'MythBusters' sounded like such an incredible opportunity. Where else might I be paid to make robots blow things up?
- Worldwide access to electronic parts has truly opened up the opportunity for innovation for engineers of all levels. It's an incredible time to be alive.
- Drones can be a huge advantage to agencies fighting natural disasters. They can launch immediately, gather vital data about an emergency situation, and help efficiently relay that information to all agencies involved, all without putting further lives at risk.
- Even when I was young, I would build things with Lego or make 'robots' out of cereal boxes - long before I learned metalwork. The desire to build was always there.
- There are plenty of myths out there that are either really expensive to do or incredibly difficult or complicated to execute.
