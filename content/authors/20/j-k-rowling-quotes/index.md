- I loved writing for kids, I loved talking to children about what I'd written, I don't want to leave that behind.
- I do get recognized, but I must say Edinburgh is a fantastic city to live if you're well-known. There is an innate respect for privacy in Edinburgh people, and I also think they're used to seeing me walking around, so I don't think I'm a very big deal.
- With all of their benefits, and there are many, one of the things I regret about e-books is that they have taken away the necessity of trawling foreign bookshops or the shelves of holiday houses to find something to read. I've come across gems and stinkers that way, and both can be fun.

- I sometimes have a tendency to walk on the dark side.

- I was convinced that the only thing I wanted to do ever - was write novels.
- If you love something - and there are things that I love - you do want more and more and more of it, but that's not the way to produce good work. So as an author, I need to write what I need to write.

- I think you have a moral responsibility when you've been given far more than you need, to do wise things with it and give intelligently.
- His priority did not seem to be to teach them what he knew, but rather to impress upon them that nothing, not even... knowledge, was foolproof.

- I feel 80% of my life is completely normal.
- I just write what I wanted to write. I write what amuses me. It's totally for myself. I never in my wildest dreams expected this popularity.
- The middle class is so funny, it's the class I know best, and it's the class where you find the most pretension, so that's what makes the middle classes so funny.
- I will carry on writing, to be sure. But I don't know if I would want to publish again after Harry Potter.

- But I was the most unashamed lone parent you were ever going to meet.
- Why do I talk about the benefits of failure? Simply because failure meant a stripping away of the inessential. I stopped pretending to myself that I was anything other than what I was, and began to direct all my energy into finishing the only work that mattered to me.

- What's coming will come and we'll just have to meet it when it does.

- I am the freest author in the world.
- I don't think about who the audience is for my books.
- People ask me if there are going to be stories of Harry Potter as an adult. Frankly, if I wanted to, I could keep writing stories until Harry is a senior citizen, but I don't know how many people would actually want to read about a 65 year old Harry still at Hogwarts playing bingo with Ron and Hermione.
- I remember the first time I heard a teenager say 'LOL.' Just what? But it means 'laugh.' Why don't you just laugh? What are you doing?
- It is perfectly possible to live a very moral life without a belief in God, and I think it's perfectly possible to live a life peppered with ill-doing and believe in God.

- And the idea of just wandering off to a cafe with a notebook and writing and seeing where that takes me for awhile is just bliss.
- My favorite literary heroine is Jo March. It is hard to overstate what she meant to a small, plain girl called Jo, who had a hot temper and a burning ambition to be a writer.
- It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends.
- We're a phenomenally snobby society, and it's such a rich seam. The middle class is so funny: it's the class I know best, and it's the class where you find the most pretension, so that's what makes the middle classes so funny.
- I think you could ask 10 English people the same question about class and get a very different answer.

- When people are very damaged, they can often meet the world with a kind of defiance.
- I always have a basic plot outline, but I like to leave some things to be decided while I write.

- I am not a particularly thick-skinned person.
- Some of the furor that surrounded a Harry Potter publication was fun.
- Every now and then I read a poem that does touch something in me, but I never turn to poetry for solace or pleasure in the way that I throw myself into prose.

- Never be ashamed! There's some who'll hold it against you, but they're not worth bothering with.
