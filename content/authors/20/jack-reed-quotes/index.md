quotes = ['''The financial crisis is a stark reminder that transparency and disclosure are essential in today's marketplace.''' ,'''We are today, in this country, convulsed by the situation in Iraq. It is an extraordinary crisis. It is taxing our men and women in uniform, and it is certainly taxing our resolve.''' ,'''Having grown up as a young Army officer in the Vietnam era, I had an instinctual sort of notion that you have to look very carefully and weigh very carefully what anyone says.''' ,'''Americans cannot afford to turn a blind eye to Russian interference in our democracy. We need to get to the facts and learn lessons to prevent future misconduct by foreign governments.''' ,'''I am extremely privileged to serve Rhode Island in the United States Senate, and that is my only goal and aspiration.''' ,'''There is sometimes a tendency to assume that everyone in this great country has adequate housing. But when you go to certain places, certain neighborhoods, both urban and rural, you find out that's not the case, and I think we have to do much more.''' ,'''The one thing that the president continues to diminish, which I think is unfortunate, is the fact that the Russian government, at the highest level, deliberately interfered with our election in 2016, and according to all of our experts in the intelligence community, they are coming back with more force in 2018 and 2020.''' ,'''If we don't have accurate information, if we are not able to tell difficult truth one to another, we will never be able to effectively design a policy for Iraq.''' ,'''The best reduction, the most final reduction, is to destroy the warheads.''' ,'''The administration is manufacturing a crisis that does not exist in order to dismantle Social Security.''' ,'''Having committed ourselves to Iraq, we must prevail, and to prevail, we must fund all of the requirements for our military. We must do it adequately and promptly, and the administration is doing neither.''' ,'''Improving oversight of hedge funds and other private funds is vital to their sustainability and to our economy's stability.''' ,'''We can best honor the memories of those who were killed on September 11 and those who have been killed fighting the war on terrorism, by dedicating ourselves to building a free and peaceful world safe from the threat of terrorism.''' ,'''We're in danger of breaking our army and preventing our national leaders from having the flexibility to confront not just Iraq and Afghanistan, but crises around the globe.''' ,'''To disregard the obvious is not a good trait in a leader in any situation.''' ,'''The President has no real plan to address the fiscal challenges arising from the retirement of the baby boom generation, let alone a plan to fix Social Security.''' ,'''It's not wrong to be skeptical. I was one who participated in the debate on Iraq and voted against the resolution because I was skeptical of the intelligence. But that was based on looking at the facts, analyzing the case in as rational and as logical way as you can, not simply concluding or dismissing facts.''' ,'''President Trump has a serious credibility problem. He tries to take credit for jobs he didn't create and, with respect to the F-35 program, savings that were achieved before he even took office.''' ,'''Hedge funds, private equity and venture capital funds have played an important role in providing liquidity to our financial system and improving the efficiency of capital markets. But as their role has grown, so have the risks they pose.''' ,]
