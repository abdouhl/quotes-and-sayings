But this relationship is secret and incomprehensible, beyond the bounds of reason and analysis.''' ,'''For the word is dialectical in itself and at the same time is integrated into the whole of existence. By this I mean that the word is intended to be lived.''' ,'''Prayer holds together the shattered fragments of the creation. It makes history possible.''' ,'''Modern technology has become a total phenomenon for civilization, the defining force of a new social order in which efficiency is no longer an option but a necessity imposed on all human activity.''' ,'''The goal of modern propaganda is no longer to transform opinion but to arouse an active and mythical belief.''' ,'''Thinking has become a superfluous exercise... purely internal, without compelling force, more or less a game.''' ,'''It is the emergence of mass media which makes possible the use of propaganda techniques on a societal scale.''' ,'''The Holy Spirit alone can do this, the Holy Spirit alone can establish this link with one's neighbor.''' ,'''In sum, thought and reflection have been rendered thoroughly pointless by the circumstances in which modern men and women live and act.''' ,'''Mass media provides the essential link between the individual and the demands of the technological society.''' ,'''The intellectual who wants to do her work properly must today go back to the starting point: the woman whom she knows, and first of all to herself.
