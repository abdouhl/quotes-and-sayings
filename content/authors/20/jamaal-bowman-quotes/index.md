quotes = ['''Acts of antisemitism move us backwards, further from our collective goals, and further from cultivating a community wherein everyone can feel as though they are valued, respected, and most importantly, safe to practice religion and live freely in their identity.''' ,'''As long as energy is treated as a commodity, not a right, poor people, workers, and communities of color will suffer.''' ,'''Alex, AOC, Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez, she was a mentor from afar, even before I got to Congress.''' ,'''I'm a sponge, man. I'm a learner.''' ,'''Losing your home is one of the most destabilizing, inhumane things a person can experience.''' ,'''I talk about the politics of love over the politics of fear... Fear is rooted in institutional racism. It's this fear of what's different, fear of the unknown, and looking at something that's different as deficient. It doesn't have to be that way. It doesn't have to be a zero sum game.''' ,'''The impact of poverty on our kids and their learning. That's something I've understood pretty intimately throughout my career as an educator.''' ,'''The very name Jerusalem means City of Peace. Violently evicting families from their homes in which generations have lived is not an act of peace. A show of strong force during prayer is not an act of peace. Destroying holy sites is not an act of peace.''' ,'''College athletes are workers, period. They are skilled and disciplined young people who deserve so much more than to be treated, in many cases, as sources of revenue without autonomy or ownership over their labor and value by the colleges and universities they attend.''' ,'''No Republican vote in favor of an infrastructure package should supersede our mission: to build an America that works for the people, not for massive corporations. Getting Republicans on board is not necessary. Getting the American people back on their feet is.''' ,'''So, I started teaching in 1999 in the South Bronx.''' ,'''Violence begets violence, and hate begets hate. Both hate and violence beget a society that harms, and makes impossible the healing necessary for us to reach our full potential.''' ,'''Hip Hop is the rebirth of civilization. For people who were disconnected from their continent, from their language, from their culture, and from their ancestry, Hip Hop represented a step toward rediscovering what it means to be a Black American, or to be a Latino American.''' ,'''The care economy impacts all of us: our children, elderly loved ones, family members with disabilities, child care workers, home health aides, nurses, and so many more. Care is something we all need, at different stages in our lives.''' ,'''The school-to-prison pipeline - the disproportionality that exists in handing out school discipline in schools to Black and Brown students for simple infractions - pushes kids out of classrooms and into our ever-growing system of mass incarceration.''' ,'''Whoever becomes Education Secretary has to have a love and passion for public schools. Not charter schools, not vouchers, but public schools.''' ,'''Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has endorsed and enabled a doctrine of obstructionism that's prevented Americans from seeing the help and progress they desperately need.''' ,'''Appreciating teachers means transforming the way we think about education and the way we design curriculums. It means protecting the rights of teachers to unionize and collectively bargain.''' ,'''As we deal with a devastating climate crisis caused by decades of unchecked corporate greed, we need to center our children and their future.''' ,'''I believe our current system of capitalism is slavery by another name.''' ,'''I'm trying my best not to raise my children with fear of the police.''' ,'''We need to ask ourselves what kind of systems and structures we want in place - not only for people to survive, but also to thrive and reach their full potential.''' ,'''I ran for office because I believe personally that the cycle of poverty is systemic, is rooted in racial injustice, and is rooted in gender bias. It is violence. It is trauma. It is a crime. But, most importantly, it is our policy choice.''' ,'''We have to break the cycle of structural racism, and build a truly just society for all of us.''' ,'''Racist infrastructure has damaged districts like mine for generations.''' ,'''I've been locked up for not having insurance, only to be released. I mean, this sort of thing is just par for the course when you're Black or brown in America.''' ,'''If you care about social and racial justice, innovation, and humanity, become a teacher. There are amazing kids who have unlimited potential and ideas who need someone who cares about them and their learning.''' ,'''We have all ethnicities, religions, economic statuses, orientations, genders, so much diversity. We need to make sure that that diversity is seen, is heard, is respected, has a seat at the table, and is pulling a lever of power - either from a community perspective or from the perspective of elected officials.''' ,'''My number one priority is the safety of our communities, and particularly the safety of our children.''' ,'''We must work together to unlearn the biases that make our foundation week, and rebuild a foundation of collective care, love, and cooperation.''' ,'''What we badly need in this country is a National Truth and Reconciliation Commission, like what we've seen in other nations that have tried to turn the page on injustice.''' ,'''Our response to crises cannot be adding more and more police funding.''' ,'''We need to invest in our people and a livable planet if we want to build an economy that works for everyone.''' ,'''We did not go to Congress just to talk the talk - we are here to walk the walk.''' ,'''The barriers to careers in STEM that people of color and traditionally underrepresented groups face need to be broken down.''' ,'''Our foreign aid to other nations should never be used to harm.''' ,'''We need a real, honest, and national conversation about racism in America, because the status quo is a crisis for too many Black and brown people who are losing their lives every single day.''' ,'''We will continue our work to uphold the values within our families, communities, and institutions that our service members have fought to protect: equality, justice, opportunity, freedom, and a shared responsibility to each other.''' ,'''I was 11 years old when I was initially brutalized by the police, just for horse-playing with my friends and not responding to the police in the way they wanted me to.''' ,'''When I look at American history, I see how it has been driven by resistance and protest against a system that has been oppressive to not just Black people but to women, to members of the LGBTQ community.''' ,'''We need a Green New Deal for Public Housing, as my colleague and friend Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez has proposed. We need a Green New Deal for Cities, as my friend Cori Bush has proposed. And we need a Green New Deal for Public Schools.''' ,'''Without a holistic care infrastructure to support us, our economy and society simply cannot thrive.''' ,'''Roads and bridges can't serve us if they're continually eroded by a worsening climate crisis.''' ,'''We need to make power a public utility to end man-made energy disasters and ensure that no family ever has to choose between keeping the lights on or feeding their kids.''' ,'''You know what Donald Trump is more afraid of than anything else? A Black man with power.''' ,'''We can heal our planet, use cleaner and more efficient sources of energy while creating green jobs.''' ,'''My second year of teaching I was chosen to be a crisis intervention teacher. Our school was a kindergarten through fourth grade school with 1,500 kids, largely recent immigrants from Africa and South America. And it was in one of the poorest zip codes in the country. The classes were too big, the school was underfunded.''' ,'''Our strength as a democracy relies on voter confidence.''' ,'''Our schools, like so many parts of our infrastructure, are crumbling across the country. Healing our schools can and should be central to our fight to achieve environmental, racial and economic justice.''' ,'''My problem is white comfort with Black death. I am personally tired of white comfort with black death.''' ,'''All my kids do is make fun of me.''' ,'''Being a candidate who doesn't take corporate PAC money forced me to be accountable to the people I serve and to meet them where they are.''' ,'''As we continue our fight to advance civil rights and racial justice, we need to not only recognize but celebrate how Hip Hop and Black Americans have given so much to our culture and our country.''' ,'''Our crumbling infrastructure disproportionately harms Black, brown, Indigenous, and low-income communities. The negative health impacts arising from fossil fuel use, industrial pollution, and toxic materials in our homes and schools are literally making us sick.''' ,'''Caregiving is almost always provided by women, and especially Black and brown women. This work has historically been made invisible, which creates opportunities for the exploitation and poverty wages many of our caregivers face without protection or recourse.''' ,'''I deeply love the students that I serve. I tried to do anything in my power to give them additional resources and support so they could do well in school and beyond.''' ,'''Nothing will ever bring back George Floyd, or any of the thousands of others we have lost to racist police violence.''' ,'''We must hire more social workers and counselors in our schools than police officers.''' ,'''Our democracy is falling apart - we can't just let that happen.''' ,'''Congressman Engel had a reputation quite frankly for being absent from the community, being disengaged and not being a leader or fighter on the issues that matter most, and that's not just rhetoric.''' ,'''As legislators, it's our job to create accessible voting systems that inspire confidence in the accuracy of tabulation and verifiability of results. It's also our job to make certain that the Board of Elections has every resource they need in order to carry out that purpose.''' ,'''I see myself as a person who is pushing back and fighting against oppression in all its forms, centering racial and economic injustice very explicitly.''' ,'''We need to stop sending federal military equipment to local police departments.''' ,'''We must empower educators to provide the best learning environment possible for students.''' ,'''The Green New Deal for Public Schools represents the level of school infrastructure investment that is urgent and necessary to heal the harm from decades of disinvestment, redlining and cycles of poverty and trauma, particularly for Black and brown children.''' ,'''I remember being a young black kid in high school, I didn't think the establishment or the political system was for me. I didn't think the system was for me, and I know a lot of kids feel that way.''' ,'''When we condemn hate, when we condemn antisemitism, we also must commit to working together to eradicate the biases within all of us that allow hate to spread, unfettered.''' ,'''The story of the American Jewish community is one of resilience and transformation. While often facing antisemitism and discrimination, the Jewish community fought to build better lives for themselves while making this nation a better place for all.''' ,'''Teachers are the lifeblood of our communities and the ones who nurture the future of our world.''' ,'''Climate change is ravaging our cities - we can't just let that happen.''' ,'''I believe with all my heart that bold, public investments in care for people, communities, and the environment can anchor the rebirth of our country and secure our future.''' ,'''Congress has the authority to authorize spending and investment to historically neglected and marginalized communities.''' ,'''A true infrastructure investment must include transforming our economy to handle the climate crisis, supporting care workers, reforming SSI, making child care universal, rebuilding our crumbling public schools, and much more.''' ,'''We need to rebuild our nation with a new foundation. A foundation rooted in love, and care, and equality. Where justice is truly real for all of us, regardless of race, class, gender, orientation, or religion. I fully believe we can.''' ,'''I've been arrested for 'stealing' my own car, only to be released.''' ,'''I would never try to fill John Lewis's shoes. I can only be myself - my authentic self.''' ,'''We can have a political system that works for the people and allows for the economy to thrive. It doesn't have to be either.''' ,'''My background is: I'm a Black man in America, victim of police brutality, victim of institutional racism, working-class from working-class roots.''' ,'''I am endorsing Joe Biden. He has to be our president. Donald Trump is a racist and a fascist, and we have to do everything in our power to make sure Joe Biden wins.''' ,'''Yes, we need a substantial investment in our hard infrastructure like roads and bridges. But roads and bridges can't serve people if they don't have the child care they need in order to go to work or the health care they need to stay healthy and participate in the workforce.''' ,'''As chair of the Energy Subcommittee, I look forward to passing visionary policy that seeks to infuse climate justice with economic and racial justice.''' ,'''I support defunding the police - particularly the militarization of our police force and reallocating those resources toward public health. And not just health care but mental health support, affordable housing, education, alternatives to incarceration, non-emergency responses to those who might be in mental distress.''' ,'''To reimagine our country, we must first rebuild our infrastructure with community priorities at the center.''' ,'''Many elected Republicans know that ensuring that people of color can vote freely would spell bad news for them and their agenda, which privileges corporations and the wealthy.''' ,'''I'm a Black man who was raised by a single mother in a housing project. That story doesn't usually end in Congress.''' ,'''Democracy, as a governing system, is built on the foundational concept that when you cast your ballot, that ballot ensures your voice, will, and perspective will be accounted for in the direction of your city, state, or country.''' ,'''In using the English language to create an entirely new art form, the pioneers of Hip Hop created a vessel that grew to impact nearly every facet of American culture.''' ,'''We need to end qualified immunity at the federal level, where police can violate a person's civil rights with impunity, which we've seen happening time and time again.''' ,'''I was suspended and discarded. I was told to go to hell by administrators. I was placed in classes far beneath my intelligence. I even had a teacher tell me my life was ruined.''' ,'''It's important for Muslims and non-Muslims to stand together against hate in all of its forms, particularly against Islamophobia because quite often Islamophobia is almost like the forgotten '-ism' and the forgotten phobia that is always present.''' ,'''If you look throughout American history, it has been protests and mass movements and the people rising up that has moved to this country forward.''' ,'''We need a transformation to our energy system that not only reflects our climate reality. We need an energy system that is of, by, and for the people - not corporations seeking the largest possible profit.''' ,'''Once an educator, always an educator!''' ,'''You know, I grew up Black in America, I grew up close to Spanish Harlem where we ain't have much money, but we was like all friends and cool and playing and going to school together.''' ,'''I'm going to be the kind of congressperson where I'm going to be at rallies with the people, fighting for justice and being present and showing them that they have a fighter and a champion in Congress with them and for them.''' ,'''Defund the police does not mean abolish the police. It means a dramatic reduction in the number of police in our poor communities and particularly our poor Black and Brown communities.''' ,'''In the 21st century, we must rethink broadband as a basic utility alongside gas, electric, and water.''' ,'''Ending the school-to-prison pipeline is not a small task and requires detangling the myth of white superiority from our entire education system.''' ,'''The College Athlete Right to Organize Act is the first step in bringing college sports into the 21st century by ensuring college athletes have the right to collectively bargain across teams and conferences, and that they are able to advocate for rights, protections, and compensation commensurate with the value they undeniably provide.''' ,'''We need a federal jobs guarantee that puts everyone to work toward a green, clean renewable energy economy.''' ,]
