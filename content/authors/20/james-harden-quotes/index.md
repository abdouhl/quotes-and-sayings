- Growing up, I wish that I'd had the supplies and laptops and all the new technology that's out right now.
- Personally, I'm a V-neck guy.
- This year I've just been aggressive. I still have that mindset of passing the ball, and being aggressive and attacking to the basket is going to draw more attention, and that way I can find my teammates. Being in attack mode is something I try to bring into every single game, and that's what's making me be so successful.
- I mesh with anyone.
- I've never had much notoriety. It's fine with me.
- In a business, you've got to move on.
- During summer or charity games I'll wear my bright orange or green or turquoise ones and guys are always like, 'Why are your shoes so bright?'
- The kind of support we have in Oklahoma City, it's the best in the NBA. Phenomenal. Beards in the crowd, the whole nine. The city is really something special.
- That excitement on the court, I'm the same way off the court. I like to have fun, meet people; I like to give high-fives to the kids courtside. Just have fun. That's kind of my personality, that's how I've been.
- My dream was to be in the NBA. I wasn't really focused on being a star player on a team. I just wanted to make it to the NBA. I've been blessed for the opportunities to be in the Finals, been in the playoffs ever since I've been in the NBA.
- I took a back seat and did whatever it took for the team to win.
- I'm old school. I'm not the fastest guy or the quickest guy.
- I have a collection of 50-plus snapback hats.
- I'm old school.
- Some guys travel with expensive Louis Vuitton luggage but it gets all scratched up under the plane. I'd rather not spend too much money on something that's just going to get messed up.
- I'm not the fastest guy or the quickest guy.
- I heard a lot of those things. I heard that I was greedy; that I didn't care about winning; heard the questioning of my loyalty. And I'm thinking: 'Of course I want to win. I've been winning my entire life.'
- I have an iPhone, too, but I use the Blackberry more because I'm addicted to BBM'ing. I'm also on Twitter 24/7 and it's a lot easier on the BlackBerry.
- Growing up in college, in high school, I was the focal point.
- In any situation, I'm going to be good.
- There are a lot of guys who play in the NBA. There aren't a lot of guys who have a chance to win a gold medal, too.
- Being named as a finalist for the USA Basketball National Team is an unbelievable feeling and an opportunity that is truly humbling. It is an honor to be included with such talented players and I look forward to the chance to represent my country this summer.
- Now, I'm back to my old ways: Needing to be the leader, needing to score.
