quotes = ['''I've always seen architecture as a healing art, not just as a beautification art.''' ,'''I don't think architecture should be considered as an art form in the first instance. Whenever I say that, it makes people really angry. But this is a very political profession in the Grecian sense. I believe there have to be reasons for every building, and that the ideas should not be self-referential.''' ,'''I had it drummed into me from an early age that personalizing everything was not a good thing. Besides, I don't think that kind of commodity-driven system makes for the most productive architecture.''' ,'''I went into architecture a little as 'Peck's Bad Boy.' It allowed me to be a critic in a socially condoned way.''' ,'''I kind of cherish at least the idea of Midwestern candor and openness. But I couldn't live there.''' ,]
