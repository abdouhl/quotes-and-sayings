But you are - and you move on.''' ,'''I've said it really from the beginning that the stars have always aligned with Inspiration4.''' ,'''When I found out that Inspiration 4 was gonna be the first all-civilian mission to space, well then there's no chance that's going to be a bunch of fishing buddies going on a joy ride.

Once you're going past the speed of sound it's really what is on the vehicle that you're hearing.''' ,'''It was a real business.
