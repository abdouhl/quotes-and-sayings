- Being transgender is not just a medical transition.
- I look at people for their souls, and I can see myself falling in love with anyone after getting to know them and developing a relationship.
- On every single picture on my Instagram page, you'll find a negative comment.

- A lot of people - boys - look at me differently. They think that if they date me, they are gay because they are dating another boy. In instances like this, I feel almost excluded, if that's the right word. I feel like I'm being put on a different shelf.
- Often, when a girl has a crush on a boy, her friend will dare her to speak to him or ask for a pencil, or better yet, let him know that she has a crush. Pretty risky stuff... It happens thousands of times a day in the lives of teenagers everywhere. Putting yourself out there. Daring to expose your true feelings.

- With my own videos, I definitely have more control over what I want to put out there and what I want to say. With the TV show, I'm not the editor. There's always things that I wanted to put in there. My dad has the final say in everything on YouTube, but I can be more expressive.
