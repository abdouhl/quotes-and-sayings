- It was so simple in the old days. You put out an album, people promoted it, it got in the charts, and you had a hit.
- I try to find nice chord changes, that's how I love to start, and then I start trying to knock it into a song, knock it into shape.
- At the end of the day I have to please myself. And I've made a record to please myself.
- Yes, I love to play drums and bass and guitar and piano. Those are the main instruments I play. That is it.
- I just want to be in the studio. When you've got all the gear you want in your own house, it's difficult to go out and do something else, you know?
- I just realized how long it was since the last album, and where did the time go? You know?
- I think from the age of thirteen, I really wanted to be a producer and I've always thought that the producer was the top of the tree.
- Old music is the same as new music - it's just a different way of delivering it.
- As you get older, the days have gone, and the years have gone, and it's 'whoosh!'
- Live shows are fun - sometimes. But you have to practice for months on end.
- I don't actually like touring.
- When you do a song new live on stage, it's kind of a bit weird until it gets worn in, you know, like oiled up a bit. It's still a little bit stiff until you really thrashed at it for a few weeks.
- The hairs stand up on the back of my neck at certain music.
- To me, making records isn't work.
- I'm still getting thrilled with music even after 40 years of doing it professionally.
- The first band I saw were Mike Sheridan and The Nightriders, in their brown mohair suits, in 1966.
- Music is my first love.
