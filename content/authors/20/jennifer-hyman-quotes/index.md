I can be listening to an indie pop song just as easily as I could be listening to a Carly Simon song from the '70s to a country song.''' ,'''As opposed to thinking about ourselves as disrupting the fashion industry, we're thinking about ourselves more broadly - about disrupting the closet and how you get dressed.''' ,'''Founders are often great storytellers because they're in the business of constantly selling a dream against all odds.''' ,'''I can dance to Beyonce, sing karaoke, create strategy, go on dates, and build a multi-billion company and show the world that women can build big businesses.''' ,'''I sleep around 8 hours, but I tend to wake up several times a night with constant dreams, thoughts, and ideas related to Rent the Runway.''' ,'''I want to put H&M and Zara out of business.''' ,'''I've always loved artists - creative, spontaneous, laid-back people - but I wasn't meeting these types in real life.

People have challenges. Family members get sick, people get older, you don't always get the job or the promotion that you want. You have conflicts in your life. And really, life is about your resilience and your ability to go through your life and all of the ups and downs with a positive attitude.''' ,'''Clothing enables people to self-express, and that's why variety, when it comes to our wardrobe, has become more and more important over time.''' ,'''Every single day, entrepreneurship has highs and lows, and you need to feel like you have a community around you.
