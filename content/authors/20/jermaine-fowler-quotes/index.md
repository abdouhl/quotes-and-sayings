- Comedians play off of social commentary.

- I'm pretty much a comic that dwells on what happened to me instead of what's happening to me.
- 'V for Vendetta' is an amazing movie, and it had an obvious message, but it was done so perfectly. I got out of the movie, and I wanted to march so hard. I wanted to be an activist.
- I've always loved the idea of the rookie cop vs. the grizzled veteran. A lot of comedy can be mined from that.

- I wanted people to know that my grandmother was the reason why I did comedy in the first place. She pushed me to really get out there and pursue my dreams.
- I have a lot of energy, and as you get to know me, you will quickly learn that! I channel my energy into my acting, my writing, everything.

- My friend gave me a VHS tape of Eddie Murphy's 'Raw.' I watched it so many times, I fell in love with it. I would watch it every day, just picking it apart. And then I started doing open mics around Maryland and D.C.: that's where I'm from. And I haven't stopped since.

- Dave Chappelle - he's one of my favorite icons. I can't think of anyone who's funnier.

- My dad kicked me out of the house when I was 18. I was supposed to go to community college. I wasn't really into going because I wanted to do stand-up, and he felt I was wasting my time.
- I used to record 'Futurama' episodes on my cassette player and play it to help me go to sleep.

- I believe the more you talk about everyday issues, the more it helps other people deal with it themselves.
- In Hollywood, it's not what you know but who you know.
- CBS garners a predominately older white audience, and by having a show like 'Superior Donuts' on their weekly programming, it distorts what people are used to seeing in a positive way. It's a show I think was necessary.
- The millennial generation is very vocal.

- Flying is just such a hassle. If I had a million dollars, I would teleport.
- Broadcast TV has a very classy but old-fashioned way of doing television. That's what it's always going to be. But you've still got to introduce young talent and ideas and shows to the masses. That's the way you build a bigger and younger audience, introducing younger writers, comics, TV shows to viewers.

- I've been poor most of my life.
- I sat down with CBS, and we talked about me developing a show for them. At the time, I was meeting with a lot of networks.

- When comics are in the room, people have a tendency to try to make them laugh. That doesn't really make you funnier. It makes you a comic's comic, but you aren't going to get a fan base doing that.
- Black Panther is a cool superhero and all, but let's be honest: He doesn't quite have the legs to prop up a blockbuster on his own.
- I'd been writing sketches since high school, but 'Friends of the People' really taught me about structure - how to wait out a joke, how to stick with it for a while. It also made me more confident onstage as a performer.
