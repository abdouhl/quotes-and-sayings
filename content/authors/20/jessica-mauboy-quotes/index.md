quotes = ['''I am a deeply competitive person when it comes to music.''' ,'''When I go back home, I am just Jess, no-one special.''' ,'''When I was growing up, every Sunday was a rest day, so after church, we'd get all my cousins and sisters together, and my parents would take us all shop hopping. We'd go to all the different shops, and Target was always the last on the list; we'd walk in, and Mum would say, 'Go on, go crazy!'''' ,'''We have incredible record labels in Australia, but sometimes they have a preconceived idea of how to do things.''' ,'''I never went to music school.''' ,'''My father is Indonesian Timorese, my mother Aboriginal Australian.''' ,'''I love to kick back at home with some good food, friends, & family and watch DVDs!''' ,'''When I get into the studio, it's not about trying to get a good song, it's about whatever comes naturally.''' ,'''Before every performance, you need at least half an hour to focus on what you are about to do: the walk-on and walk-off, the lyrics, how you are going to sing it - like, the original or bring your own personal flavour to it - how are you going to make it the best.''' ,'''I like to branch across a lot of different styles and brands in the way I dress; it's just the way my style works. So I love that I can walk into a Target store and think, 'Oh my God, I love these jeans,' and then I'll pair them with something designer.''' ,'''Obviously, my Indigenous culture is very special to me.''' ,'''There were country songs I connected to when there was pain, when I saw things my family were going through. It was my way of acknowledging I wasn't OK: music tapped on the door; I could work out these emotions by singing.''' ,'''We've had real strong aboriginal male artists who've crossed over to the mainstream who have toured the U.K., who have been a massive influence on myself and many, many communities around Australia.''' ,'''I have written with some amazing singers and songwriters - the moment with Snoop Dogg was amazing - but being able to tell an Aboriginal story is bigger than anything that I have ever known.''' ,'''I like to go for a run - it really clears my head and releases any stress from the day.''' ,'''I've always been a big fan of Mariah Carey. I think it's her personality. As much as she has an amazing voice, she has a crazy personality and I love the fact that she's not afraid to hide that.''' ,'''I thank my mum, dad, and home for keeping me in touch with my own country and my own land. I can be in the studio with Snoop Dogg or singing for Oprah, but I'm still me.''' ,'''There hasn't been that many indigenous Australians who have made it in the pop industry.''' ,'''I'm a big fan of 'The IT Crowd.' That's where I discovered Chris O'Dowd.''' ,'''Country music is who I really, really am deeply.''' ,'''Listening to country music as a kid allowed my imagination to run wild.''' ,'''I just want to play music with a band, live.''' ,'''I would definitely be open to more films if the role was right. I haven't thought about a move to Hollywood, but if there was a good opportunity, and it happened that way, then I would definitely consider it!''' ,'''The first thing I do when I get home is take my shoes off and go barefoot.''' ,'''I have a black pair of suede Jimmy Choos. I've only worn them once to a Sony event. The heels have these arrow plates in a pattern. There's gold, black and white and they're amazing!''' ,'''The storytelling in country music is so powerful.''' ,'''There's been moments where I've felt, as an indigenous woman growing up in Australia, there's been that kind of rivalry of being indigenous... I've had that experience of someone saying, 'I don't know if she's going to go that far.'''' ,'''Eurovision is a wonderfully joyous and unique event.''' ,'''I've always looked up to Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey for their outstanding vocal performances. I've always been inspired by them.''' ,'''I like to paint - I love arts and crafts.''' ,'''Getting up and having the courage to share with people, all people, and even just being asked to sing, first of all, that's all part of how I express my identity.''' ,]
