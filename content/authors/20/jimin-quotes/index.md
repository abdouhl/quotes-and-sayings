- It would be really great if our music continues to touch people. Once your heart is moved, it will develop to something better and positive.
- I think the things that everyone can do are small things, but if they're done, it will eventually help the environment. I think recycling is the biggest effort I'm making.
- I like the Hulk from 'Avengers.' Most people like Iron Man, but I like how the Hulk smashes everything.
- I went so far as to learn how to rap.
- When I don't wear eyeliner, I am shy and I feel like I can't dance.
- We have songs that are as good as and even better than 'Dynamite,' so I hope that fans will look forward to it.
- I think I get inspiration from places where I see nature.
- I wish BTS could set up a model for k-pop with the best music and content so we have a positive impact on the U.S. music scene.
