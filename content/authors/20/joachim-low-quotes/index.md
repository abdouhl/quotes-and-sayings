quotes = ['''Those who know me are aware that I stand by my mistakes or non-working strategies.''' ,'''I consider 100 wins to be better than 100 defeats.''' ,'''I would not deny that to work as a club coach could be fun.''' ,'''I said to Gotze: 'OK, show the world you are better than Messi and can decide the World Cup.' I told him that. I always had a good feeling about Gotze.''' ,'''I don't think we should compare club teams with international teams because they are different cups of tea.''' ,'''You cannot let him out of your sight, literally. You've always got to ask: 'what's Ronaldo doing, where is Ronaldo?'''' ,'''A coach needs to be a psychologist, because during a tournament you're looking after a team of players which is being watched closely and put under a lot of pressure.''' ,'''Everyone who knows us knows how we always encourage players to speak out, to be open and honest, to be critical. These things are very important to us.''' ,'''World Cups and European Championships should feature the best teams. When you keep increasing the number of teams, you dilute the quality.''' ,'''I strongly favour attractive football.''' ,'''Neuer is of course the best goalkeeper in the world.''' ,'''The cognitive development of the players is enormously important, as well as social competence and character values such as discipline and teamwork.''' ,'''I have faith in all my players.''' ,'''It's a long time since men's cosmetics were considered uncool.''' ,'''Every player has his own strengths and weaknesses and has to be integrated into a team.''' ,'''The high demands on teams in national leagues and of course the Champions League - it's too much.''' ,'''The World Cup is the toughest challenge there is. You have seven matches where you have to bring your best and cannot let up at any turn.''' ,'''I know lots of Korean players, Heung-Min Son from Tottenham Hotspur of course, there are also lots in the Bundesliga. They have a great mentality and are very quick.''' ,'''I don't agree with people saying that I am immune to advice or cannot admit when I make a mistake.''' ,'''Without planning there will be no success.''' ,'''Sometimes it's natural to do the safe pass, the no-frills thing, to pass it back to the goalkeeper. But I want them to do the daring thing.''' ,'''You always want to see the best players in action at a World Cup, and the players always want to measure themselves up to the very best.''' ,'''Real Madrid are an interesting club for any manager.''' ,'''There are things you can learn about certain players while watching them in action in a friendly.''' ,'''One win more, one defeat more. There are other important things: family, friendship, values.''' ,'''The important thing is that the players do what the coach tells them on the pitch, both at their club and with the national teams. And that's the case with Mats Hummels.''' ,'''In 2014, we won the World Cup without a big superstar. We won with a team performance where everyone brought something to the team and gave everything for the team.''' ,'''The role of a coach is varied. We have many tasks. To be a visionary that always looks a little bit towards the future: How should the team develop? How should it play at a tournament? Of course you also have to be the contact person for the players, where social competence also plays a role.''' ,'''When you lose a game, you are annoyed.''' ,'''The English clubs Arsenal and Manchester United focus on continuity with the same coaches for years.''' ,'''I have to tip my hat to those who have worked closely with me from the start. All these people have backed me up when it was more difficult, urging me on, so thanks to them.''' ,'''You have to be careful that you do not overdo things with too many games, because the quality must not suffer. Fans would then also turn away and the interest would subside.''' ,'''Sometimes I just have to follow my intuition.''' ,'''I don't say anything about referees' decisions, you have to accept them.''' ,'''I take sporting criticism on board very keenly and with deference, and I also try to make decisions based on it.''' ,'''I am coach of the Germany national team and there are not many jobs in the world which are better than this.''' ,'''Midfielders must do everything.''' ,'''Klopp would be a great addition to any team.''' ,'''Even before the World Cup in 2010 I had said that there were no world champions who aim to stifle the opposition's play and somehow hope to win. These teams do not go far.''' ,'''If a player is 20 or 21 and sits on the bench for two or three years, I don't know if that's useful.''' ,'''One can not win titles with result-orientated football anymore and this has been clear to me since 2008.''' ,'''Roy Hodgson is a fantastic coach. I first knew him when I was playing in Switzerland and he was national team coach. It was under him that Switzerland revolutionised their player formation system.''' ,'''There has never been even a hint of an expression of racism in the national team.''' ,'''You shouldn't be scared of putting together a team made up of experts who are better than the coach in some aspects... So for me personally, it was important to have people in my environment who discuss things with me, who give me their opinions, but who are loyal to me and who are reliable.''' ,'''Static strikers do not exist anymore.''' ,'''Stefan Kiessling is a striker who has put in very good performances in the Bundesliga over the years.''' ,'''Ozil is a great distributor and does a lot of running.''' ,'''You need to be able to deal with pressure while on the ball and not keep giving it away in easy situations.''' ,'''Everybody wants to have the ball and be perfect with it.''' ,'''People always think that somehow they know everything, can do everything.''' ,'''You need superhuman performances at the World Cup.''' ,'''It's important to have players like Schweinsteiger and Khedira, the connectors, the symmetry-makers in the game.

He's hardly ever injured and has always been with the national team, where other players might have said they are tired, need a break or were injured. He has busted his butt for the national team.''' ,'''We don't play to grind out goalless draws.''' ,'''I tell my team: if we win the ball, I want to see the ball in the goal in eight seconds. That's my philosophy.''' ,'''For us, for me as national coach, the Nations League is a good invention.''' ,'''As a coach, of course I favour competition.''' ,'''The joy of the Brazilians in football is a wonderful thing no matter where you go.''' ,'''We need to be one team on the pitch.''' ,'''Intelligent players are receptive and capable of implementation.''' ,'''To sing the national anthem is wonderful, but it's far from the sign of a strong team and it is absolutely no indication of a lack of desire to fight.''' ,'''Good teams have good rotation.''' ,'''You can play happy-go-lucky football against Brazil in a friendly but not in a tournament.''' ,'''Cristiano Ronaldo is sensational, a very good professional, an incredible goalscoring machine for many years, but Messi is the most complete player I have seen.''' ,'''I don't think it's such a bad thing to have internal debate between coach and leading players.''' ,'''The end of a tournament is a good time to pause.''' ,'''At the top level you know most things about the best clubs, there aren't too many surprises.''' ,'''From my point of view, it is not the coach who becomes world champion, it is a team. Not just the players who played, but the whole squad, and also the team behind the team. Because if you want to achieve success, the whole team has to work perfectly, like a machine, and all the pieces of the puzzle need to fit together into one picture.''' ,'''Mesut Ozil, a Mario Gotze, a Mats Hummels, a Holger Badstuber, and so on - they are very mature even in their younger years.''' ,'''Every game brings important insights.''' ,'''Pep Guardiola was very good for the Bundesliga.''' ,'''If a player has good technique and a good basic speed, but is slow in the head, this may reduce his value to the team.''' ,'''If you are successful, then it is only human that you are sometimes a bit saturated. You might also lose that hunger which means that others who are more ambitious will knock you off your pedestal.''' ,'''I can see exactly why Liverpool want Klopp.''' ,'''If you have a good product, like football, you should also think about limiting it to keep the quality high.''' ,'''Italy is one of the great footballing nations, with whom we have a great sporting rivalry.''' ,'''To play at the highest level requires tremendous effort, concentration and above all, never giving up.''' ,'''If you look at the players, they need more of a break. Some players only get as little as three weeks after a major tournament and it's straight back to the grind.''' ,'''It's important that you prepare the players for what happens at a tournament, like a World Cup, for example. You can get a better idea of a situation. They can get to know the conditions, the atmosphere in the country, the stadiums and the journeys involved.''' ,'''Gotze is a miracle boy, a boy wonder. He can play any position up front.''' ,'''You can learn a lot from setbacks.''' ,'''You will often see a young player have something of a hangover following a major tournament.''' ,'''If you become world champions, there is nothing to top that. It's the result of many years of work, good decisions inside the association, good training and good players.''' ,'''Good physical conditioning is essential for success.''' ,'''Penalty shoot-outs depend on so many things.''' ,'''I know how to deal with pressure.''' ,'''I had the idea to bring an experimental squad to the Confederations Cup in 2014.''' ,'''I think the core job of a coach is to select the right players for a tournament. You need players who are mentally and physically fit, who are able to deal with difficult moments.''' ,'''You need to receive the ball and be assertive with it.''' ,'''When we play with three at the back, we need active players, who tie up the opposition and play passes forward.''' ,'''I want to establish an error culture in friendlies. We can make mistakes, learn from them and correct them.''' ,'''When someone has 100 international games more or less in a row then that's top class.''' ,'''If players from our national team are playing in the Bundesliga, it for me shows that it is at least as strong and attractive as the Premier League or La Liga.''' ,'''Sometimes, as a coach, you have to somehow accept personal disappointments.''' ,'''For us to reach the Euro 2008 final was a success.''' ,'''I am very grateful for the belief that the DFB has shown in me and I feel, generally, that despite the justified criticism towards me, I feel a lot of support and encouragement too.''' ,'''To whistle your own player at one time or another, even before kick-off, I don't think is fair. It doesn't help the player carry on, so it doesn't help the team.''' ,'''Sometimes you learn the most from your defeats.''' ,]
