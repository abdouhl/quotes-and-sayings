quotes = ['''As filmmakers, we are interested in unique voices.''' ,'''We always try to make each film different so they don't get repetitive.''' ,'''What we love about working at Marvel is they'll have a crazy opening for a movie like 'The Avengers' - like, a record-breaking all-time opening - and you get to the office on Monday, and they don't even have a pizza; it's back-to-work time.''' ,'''We love being told good stories, and we love telling good stories, and all of our energy and our effort and our thought and our passion goes into telling the best story that we can.''' ,'''First favorite character growing up was Spider-Man, second was Wolverine.''' ,'''I think we find that it's most helpful when we have both of our brains applied to an issue.''' ,'''I always say one of the great scenes from 'The Dirty Dozen' is where Jim Brown has to get grenades in the chimney.''' ,'''Disney represents the future of filmmaking in North America.''' ,'''Anthony and I are putting together a company where we won't lose our jobs based on quarterly earnings and can afford to play a longer game. That short game is what creates a glut of mediocrity in the market because people are desperate for hits, and it puts so much pressure on executives to deliver them. We will take that pressure off the artists.''' ,'''I've been collecting comics since I was 10 years old. One of the first books I ever got my hands on was a Captain America-Falcon team-up.''' ,'''Characters have to make sacrifices. To really, really feel the true emotion and the hero's journey, they have to go through trials, and those trials could cost them something.''' ,'''I think that what people love most about the Marvel universe are the characters.''' ,'''Our job with Thanos is to make him the preeminent villain in the Marvel Universe. That is his role in the comics. That's his role in these movies.''' ,'''I was a comic book nut. For real. I still have a collection in my closet.''' ,'''Heroes are a way to remove yourself from what may be difficult concepts to talk about in your life. They're a way to get some distance and have an experience in a theater where you're confronting those issues in a way that's safer for your psyche.''' ,'''If you're a comic book fan, you know that any epic book, you would open it up - as a kid, I would just go through and look at who was fighting who. I'd stand there in the store for 15 minutes until the guy told me to buy the book or get out.''' ,'''I've seen 'Goodfellas' a hundred times, and one of the things that I take away from that movie is dynamic pacing and energy. I just think that film is sort of a paragon of excellence in filmmaking and the compression of narrative.''' ,'''I like acting a lot, but it's not something I get out of bed for every day.''' ,'''We like existentially wacky characters who exist in existential crisis.''' ,'''I find that when I watch films where the villain is more complex, I find that it makes the heroes more complex and ultimately, in the story, more interesting.''' ,'''I've been fortunate enough to travel to Edinburgh a few times over the last few years, and I just loved the city. I find it one of the more beautiful cities in Europe.''' ,'''We took a very interesting journey from being really extreme art house filmmakers. But we find that working in commercial filmmaking and creating a brand on that high level affords us a lot of interesting opportunities.''' ,'''Marvel is a very streamlined studio.''' ,'''With a character called Captain , you have to address the concept of who he is because his identity is tied to his country.''' ,'''If you're a fan of auteur filmmaking, I'd say get yourself invested in some really good TV shows.''' ,'''I'm Italian, so I absorb other cultures through their food.''' ,'''We're constantly striving to bring something new and different to the table, either in the way that we're using the cameras, or the storytelling we're using in the scene, or the way that the characters are being motivated by the action.''' ,''''The Infinity War' is meant to be a culmination film. It's meant to join together all of the Marvel Cinematic Universe against an incredible universal threat - Thanos.''' ,'''We want to empower artists and filmmakers to forge new paths.''' ,'''I've had emotional experiences in VR that I haven't been able to have in two-dimensional experiences.''' ,'''Everything is finite, right? Nothing can last forever.''' ,'''We began in indies, and maybe we'll make another smaller film again sometime.''' ,'''You look at 'Arrested Development' or 'Community,' we're constantly either deconstructing genre or tone. We like to say it's like being a mad scientist: you get to play in a laboratory and experiment with directions to take narrative in.''' ,'''We like smashing genres into each other, so if you can find something that's really idiosyncratic in respect to superhero genre and you can smoosh it into it, you usually wind up with something fresh and different.''' ,'''Our language - the way that we deal with most actors is we don't like to get very complicated because we don't want them to think too much because we find it takes them out of the moment.''' ,'''I'm more compelled as an artist to see diversification than I am to keep watching an Anglo point of view in storytelling.''' ,'''There's nothing I hate more than going to see a movie and thinking, 'That could have been an hour shorter.'''' ,'''I think there's a lot of people in their dingy boats in the middle of the ocean pining for the days of closed-ended narrative.''' ,'''My feeling is that it's important that you show kids reality.''' ,'''We never intended to be comedic directors; it was just something we fell into.''' ,'''What we do is service a story first, and then you figure out how to pay for it later. If the narrative isn't your primary focus, then the movie is going to become diluted, and you don't have a movie that is as good as it could be, so it probably won't make as much money.''' ,'''I think movies moving forward are going to become long-form storytelling.''' ,'''If you look at what we did with 'Winter Soldier' with the Cap character in terms of bringing him into the modern world, trying to ground the movie tonally into something that was a step toward real-world, at least to the degree you can do that in a superhero movie, that's still the tonal universe that we're playing in 'Civil War.'''' ,'''We tend to intensely scout an area and then use our imaginations to make the best use of the geography.''' ,'''It was always the intent, in a larger arc, to split the Avengers up before the greatest threat that they've ever seen.''' ,'''I sat in a theater when I was 11 years old and watched 'The Empire Strikes Back' from 10 in the morning until 10 at night the day it came out.''' ,'''There's always loose points that people bring up, which is great, and I think that's why you read criticism is because you want to see what worked and what didn't work, and certainly you have to filter it because there's a lot of people who just love to troll.''' ,'''My brother and I are politically-minded guys.''' ,'''We grew up near a cinematheque in Cleveland, so we were very influenced by international cinema, the French New Wave, Italian neo-realists.''' ,'''What's interesting about the fans is, fans are very fickle. They all have their own opinion.''' ,'''Tim Miller is a very good friend of ours. We'd love to see 'Deadpool' jump into the MCU.''' ,'''We grew up on Scorsese and Coppola and '70s crime thrillers.''' ,'''Films used to be an event that required work and effort to get to a theater to see. Now, really good content is available immediately to us on many devices. At the same time, the audience's appetite for storytelling is evolving, and people want to spend time with characters for many years.''' ,'''As filmmakers, we love ambitious storytelling; it's one of the reasons we pushed to do 'Civil War.' We want to be as ambitious in scope as we possibly can.''' ,'''The feature space is a spectacle space. It's about getting people out of their houses to go to theater when we all have a lot of things in our home now that occupy our attention.''' ,'''We made 'Pieces' in Cleveland with zero connections to the film business. Absolutely zero.''' ,'''Chris Nolan went through Slamdance a year and a half after us, and he went on to direct 'The Dark Knight.' So the joke now is if you want to make superhero movies, that's where you have to go.''' ,'''We like layers of character and personality in our storytelling. We like very distinctive, unique personalities interacting with each other. And I think, because there are two of us, and we're a collective, we identify with that. We call it the mastermind principle: Two minds aren't doubly better than one - they're exponentially better than one.''' ,''''Avengers 3' has a beginning, middle, and a very definitive end, and 'Avengers 4' does the same.''' ,'''We get excited by ideas, and we're more excited by being surprised by ideas than we are in dictating the course of events. We've found that leads to more interesting storytelling.''' ,'''In 'Winter Soldier' - in terms of character-based, 'Winter Soldier' was so specifically for us: everything in that movie was designed around that version of Captain America that we wanted to see, that we wanted to explore. Everything in that film, all of the stylistic choices just flow from that.''' ,'''The template that 'Infinity War' is following is a very different, complex template because you've never seen so many characters in one film. It obviously has to be a multi-perspective film.''' ,'''We feel a lot of the future of storytelling is going to be in the VR space.''' ,'''Being a global citizen makes you a more interesting person.''' ,]
