That could be anything from a clip from the 'Real Housewives' to someone jumping off their roof and missing the pool to a zillion other things.''' ,''''Big Brother,' I can't believe people watch. It's just people whispering to each other for hours and then some silly challenge like, who can pull the most stones out of a stuffed alligator, with some product tie-in.''' ,'''I like anything with Zak Bagans and ghost hunters.''' ,'''When you are an actor or trying to be a working actor in L.A., most people have commercial agents, and then they have legitimate agents, and you just end up going on a thousand auditions.''' ,'''It's important to have the right agent - people that are working hard for you.
