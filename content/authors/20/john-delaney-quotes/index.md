quotes = ['''The United States faces structural employment problems because of the long-term effects of globalization and technology. This was only exacerbated by the Great Recession.''' ,'''We should, as a country, be very concerned about our borrowing cost.''' ,'''I'm not an economist, but I have spent time around thousands of small-business owners and investors, and I remain skeptical - despite the best intentions of the Fed - that even lower interest rates can make a meaningful dent in our unemployment problem.''' ,'''Federal research dollars invested at the National Institutes of Health seem expensive until we factor in the economic growth and jobs created by our world-leading life sciences industry.''' ,'''After speaking with community leaders, faith leaders, and voters across the District during my campaign, I came to understand that visiting Israel was necessary to obtain a full and proper perspective on our relationship with our strongest ally in the Middle East.''' ,'''I think some people don't truly understand the situation, and they think, you know, the debt limit, it doesn't really mean anything, and they don't understand the implications on the U.S. economy and on the global markets.''' ,'''Instead of serving special interests, Congress should focus on the big picture. Globalization and technology have completely reshaped our economy in recent decades, and if we don't respond, we're putting the future of the middle class at risk.''' ,'''Our national values demand that we assist the families of our men and women in uniform, especially at the time of their greatest need.''' ,'''I basically applied to law school as a way of telling my parents that I wasn't going to medical school.''' ,'''The big legislative updates that we need to compete in the 21st century and to raise living standards have been blocked by a reluctance to seek common ground.''' ,'''I had a very long and successful career as an entrepreneur, focused on the needs of small to midsize businesses.''' ,'''The term bipartisanship, that's a means to an end. That's not something that I think you run on. I think you run on solutions.''' ,'''The struggle these veterans face receiving adequate care for PTSD and depression is a tragedy that needs to be addressed, which is why I cosponsored the Clay Hunt SAV Act.''' ,'''Free lodging for military families with loved ones in the hospital is something all Americans can rally behind.''' ,'''I'm not advocating spending less on the elderly, but I am strongly advocating spending more on kids while also putting the country on a sound, long-term fiscal trajectory. To do that, we have to reduce the rate of growth of entitlement-related expenditures and add more revenues.''' ,'''When active duty ends, we have an obligation to uphold our own pledge: a pledge to ensure that every veteran receives the care and benefits they deserve.''' ,'''The United States has the world's largest and most innovative economy, an unmatched rule of law, and a free market that is the envy of the international community. For investors, we are the reserve currency.''' ,'''I believe this is a moment of truth for our country, a time when people of all parties and persuasions should stand together and denounce Trump's campaign. That includes our governor here in Maryland.''' ,'''There's a lot of new subject matter to learn. You start slowly peeling the onion and start figuring out how the policy and the politics intersect.''' ,'''In the context of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and a still-stagnant economy, President Barack Obama faces two important questions on energy transmission: a decision on the construction of the Keystone XL oil pipeline and the question of increasing American natural gas exports. These are choices that will resonate from Crimea to Cove Point.''' ,'''The need to change our country's fiscal trajectory, including reforming entitlement programs, is an unassailable reality that will define our time.''' ,'''For years, comprehensive tax reform has eluded legislators.''' ,'''As the founder and former chief executive of two publicly traded companies, I have had a great deal of exposure to how debt markets work.''' ,'''The impact of low interest rates is broad and deep. Many Americans rely on interest income from their savings to help cover their cost of living.''' ,'''The process to generate energy using the Canadian tar sands is particularly dirty, producing one of the most noxious fossil fuels on the planet and leaving a devastated landscape in its wake.''' ,'''Our electoral process has created perverse incentives that have warped our democracy and empowered special interests and a vocal minority.''' ,'''Federal spending is like a massive ship that takes a very long time to turn.''' ,'''The presidency of the United States is a very unique elected position. So if anything merits a longer vetting process, the presidency does to some extent. In general our election cycles are too long, but this job is so consequential that I don't think it's a bad thing to give people more time to get to know you.''' ,'''In my private sector career, two of my favorite sayings were, 'Strategy is easy and execution is really hard,' and that we should 'run at criticism.'''' ,'''We have been dealt a very weak hand by the financial market meltdown, bailouts, and recession. We can't act like it's a strong one.''' ,'''I know a moderate, more centered candidate like myself doesn't get as much attention as people who tend to say more extreme things.''' ,'''And I'm running for president to get America working again so that we can actually fix health care, build infrastructure, improve public education, make sure there's jobs in every community in this country.''' ,'''We have a sacred obligation to support our men and women in uniform.''' ,'''What was once a fringe idea - finding a way to use the record levels of overseas capital to finance new projects in the United States - is now mainstream. The support is there; we just have to work out the details.''' ,'''We have to start grounding our policies in facts and recognize that a strong economy is critical for funding progressive priorities.''' ,'''Social Security is not broke, and Social Security does not need to be privatized.''' ,'''Clay Hunt was the kind of individual that has made America a great country. In 2005, when his country needed him, he enlisted in the Marine Corps. Shot in Iraq, he earned a Purple Heart, and after he recuperated, he graduated from Marine Corps Scout Sniper School and was deployed to Afghanistan.''' ,'''During their service, men and women in our Armed Forces live by a common creed, promising never to leave a soldier behind. We should live by the same principle. When our veterans are asked to travel hundreds of miles for care that's offered right next door, we simply aren't living up to that standard, and something has to change.''' ,'''All taxpayers feel a tremendous sense of frustration as they see many tens of billions of dollars of bonuses paid to the same mega banks that were on the brink of bankruptcy and were only saved by massive government rescue money and support. We are not satisfied by the fact that many of them have paid the money back, nor should we be.''' ,'''We have to treat people who cross our borders with a measure of dignity. Right? It has to be reflective of our values.''' ,'''We already spend too few days in Congress working on meaningful legislation; we simply can't afford to waste more time on legislation that doesn't move the needle to improve the lives of everyday Americans.''' ,'''If there's any state in the country whose values are not consistent with the things Trump has been saying, it's the State of Maryland.''' ,'''Many of the patients in military and veterans hospitals require long stays, which can place a large financial hardship on families who don't live near the hospital, which is very common.''' ,'''Our employment future rests on the shoulders of the small employer, and we should be investing with them.''' ,'''Addressing climate change and positioning the United States as the leader in advanced energy should be a top priority for our country and our economy, and I applaud the Obama administration for the steps it is taking.''' ,'''As an entrepreneur and public company CEO, I've dealt with dozens of rollouts, and when unveiling a new product, the operating approach should be, 'Hope for the best but prepare for the worst.'''' ,'''What the establishment was trying to do was to position me as a Republican running in the Democratic primary.''' ,'''Small businesses are more nimble and innovative than large corporations, and as a result are much more likely to develop the breakthrough ideas we need for global competitiveness.''' ,'''Congressional dysfunction is the logical result of closed primaries, too many gerrymandered one-party seats, and low-turnout elections.''' ,'''Do I think it is good policy for the government to own companies? Normally, I'd say 'no.' But in my world, if a firm puts itself in a position that it needs a last minute rescue, and the future is uncertain at best, then the investor who steps into that breach ends up owning the company. Full stop.''' ,'''I strongly believe in a free market, and it is great when companies make money and pay their people well.''' ,'''Imagine a country where the vast majority of seniors live in poverty, a country where for many there are no golden years, but a time of struggle and dependence. That was the United States before the creation of Social Security, which has proven to be one of the most effective and important government programs in our history.''' ,'''America's disabled veterans answered our country's call, and when their time in uniform is done, our country must stand with them.''' ,'''My message is more about unity, solving problems and trying to bring the American people together around a notion of common purpose in terms of what we've got to do to build a better future.''' ,'''I believe that business creates the jobs in this country and not government.''' ,'''Getting trade policy right is huge for our economy and huge for Maryland. This is about creating Maryland jobs by selling Maryland products to Asia, moving right from Western Maryland farms out through the Port of Baltimore.''' ,'''We can't let 535 people continue to limit the progress of a nation of more than 300 million.''' ,'''Maryland is never going to be the low-cost place to live and work, and we shouldn't try to be because we have a lot of other stuff we bring to the table. And you get what you pay for.''' ,'''Low interest rates benefit individuals or investors who own or want to buy assets; in that regard, they disproportionately benefit wealthier Americans.''' ,'''I think I have a real feel for the industries that are being successful and where opportunities are, and the big issue that I really care about is U.S. competitiveness.''' ,'''The whole action around a carbon pricing mechanism, or carbon tax, is what you do with the money. Both France and Washington state proposed solving climate on the backs of workers. And that's a bad strategy.''' ,'''One of the things I've pledged is in my first hundred days, only to do bipartisan proposals. Wouldn't it be amazing if a president looked at the American people at the inauguration and said, 'I represent every one of you, whether you voted for me or not and this is how I'm going to prove it.'''' ,'''The administration must act promptly to ensure that the central premise of the Affordable Care Act is executable and, rather than dismissing criticism, should examine it in good faith and work to serve the needs of the people. President Obama must approach this problem like a CEO confronting a very bad product launch.''' ,'''By any measure, CapitalSource outperformed both our direct competitors and the financial services industry in general, particularly in the context of the near collapse of the financial services industry where 19 of the 20 largest financial institutions in the country either failed or were bailed out by the government.''' ,'''Maryland's different than Virginia. Maryland has certain advantages that Virginia doesn't have and certain disadvantages... We should just worry about ourselves and not worry about comparisons.''' ,'''Using static scoring, tax cuts are broadly assumed to 'cost' a raw amount of reduced revenue. With dynamic scoring, the new revenue likely to flow from increased economic activity produced by a tax cut is considered, improving the accuracy of the projection.''' ,'''Repealing the estate tax won't create jobs, it won't boost GDP, and it won't add efficiency to the market. Instead, repealing the estate tax will simply add to the debt, hurt our ability to build a stronger economy and worsen economic inequality.''' ,'''As a cosigner of the Veterans' Bill of Rights, I'm committed to making sure that veterans' issues remain a top priority in Congress.''' ,'''My general view is that capitalism is an amazing innovation and job-creation machine. But what we've done historically that has been so brilliant is that we've moderated it with appropriate tax policy, with regulation, with workers' rights and infrastructure in our society that make sure that everyone has an opportunity.''' ,'''Our veterans and service members are known for their strength, but when they're recovering from an operation or receiving emergency care, that strength can depend on seeing a spouse, talking with the kids or just knowing that loved ones are by their side. It isn't difficult to imagine what a difference keeping families together can make.''' ,'''I think there's a disconnect between political leaders and young voters around a lot of things related to the private sector. For example, a lot of politicians continue to attack big banks. While I'm not a defender of big banks, my sense is younger voters have had generally pretty good experiences with banks.''' ,'''We really need to move to a bit of a post-partisan world where we actually start solving problems and stop kind of living in a country where the political leaders act like half the country is entirely wrong about everything they believe and increasingly try to pit American against American.''' ,'''Many have criticized a federal carbon tax, saying that it would increase energy costs. Some continue to oppose it even when that revenue would be used to reduce other taxes in what's known as a tax swap.''' ,'''New highways, ports, and runways appear economically foolish if we don't understand the economic growth that flows from such investments.''' ,'''The way you deal with automation is by upgrading people's skills so they can get the jobs of the future.''' ,'''If done correctly, dynamic scoring will provide a more complete picture of Congress's actions. This is exactly the type of modeling the private sector uses, and advances in data collection and analysis create an opportunity for it to be employed accurately.''' ,'''So I think there's a potential to make tuition free at public universities as part as young people doing national service. I think that is the most realistic option.''' ,'''Washington is paralyzed by extreme political rhetoric that creates powerful sound bites but poor policy.''' ,'''My mother wanted me to be a doctor.''' ,'''An institution that borrows on a non-prioritized basis would never contemplate borrowing on a prioritized basis. Doing so would undermine its standing in the bond market and suggest that it is not worthy of its strong credit rating. This type of self-imposed downgrade would materially affect its financial prospects.''' ,'''If you approach economic policy with the spirit of compromise, you can actually get good support.''' ,'''I'm a Democrat in that I work towards progressive things, but I also am laser-like focused in my desire to actually get things done and not just talk about it.''' ,'''I am not a professional politician.''' ,'''A family's love is often the best medicine, and in difficult times, I believe that our military families deserve the option of staying together.''' ,'''No veteran or active duty service member should endure a long hospital stay alone. Yet sadly, due to the high cost of travel, all too often our military families are separated while America's heroes receive care. Sometimes families sleep in hospital parking lots, unable to afford long stays in a hotel.''' ,'''Our safety and security is more important than ever, and Congress needs to take an active role in enforcing international agreements that support global security.''' ,'''I don't say bad things about my Republican colleagues, ever.''' ,'''I am dedicated to making sure Social Security will be there for future generations and have written legislation to strengthen the program.''' ,'''Veterans come from all walks of life, and they live in small towns and big cities, in red states and blue states.''' ,'''I leave Medicare alone. I create a new system for everyone under 65 where they get health care as a right. It's a basic plan. We roll Medicaid into that, but then we allow people to have choices and get private insurance to supplement that basic government plan.''' ,'''Some people call me a moderate, some people call me a progressive. In truth, what I've worked on in the Congress and always - going to presidential campaigns - are these big, bold progressive ideas.''' ,'''A lack of reform - particularly in international tax - has hurt our ability to compete in a global economy by keeping U.S. corporate cash overseas and reducing domestic investment, slowing economic growth.''' ,'''Despite all the dysfunction in Washington, I believe that when it comes to helping veterans and keeping our fundamental promises as a country, we can come together and do the right thing.''' ,'''While some politicians argue over whether to believe scientists' almost overwhelming consensus on climate change, the business sector is a believer and is wisely planning ahead.''' ,'''No military or veteran family should have to choose between paying their bills and being together while one of our nation's heroes is in the hospital.''' ,'''In my judgment, the president should reject Keystone and step up natural gas exports.''' ,'''I am for a system of universal health care where every American has health care as a fundamental right because I think that's where we should be as a civilized society.''' ,'''I just don't think the Democratic party is going to vote for someone because of the colour of their skin. They care about their values. They care what they're going to fight for. They care about their vision for the future.''' ,'''The single-payer Medicare for All proposal is not only bad policy, but it's bad politics. It's bad politics for a very simple reason: More than half the country has private insurance and most of them like it.''' ,'''We started CapitalSource because large banks were ignoring small to mid-sized businesses, and we saw a big business opportunity as a result.''' ,'''With Washington already broken, the last thing we need is a left-wing version of the Tea Party.''' ,'''There are definitely problems with technology companies, mostly around privacy, in my opinion, and the fact that they don't protect our privacy and we haven't passed privacy laws.''' ,'''One of the key issues all veterans face is making the transition to a civilian career, and for veterans who need extra medical attention, this can be even more difficult.''' ,'''Two decades of experience as an entrepreneur and CEO has informed my view that our priorities must stress improving educational outcomes, rebuilding America's infrastructure, lowering health care costs, addressing climate change, reforming immigration, and ushering in an advanced energy economy.''' ,'''I'm a blue-collar kid who went on to become a successful entrepreneur. I was the youngest CEO in the history of the New York Stock Exchange. Now I've served my country for six years in the House of Representatives.''' ,'''While many employers do the right thing and provide flexible schedules for disabled veterans, I felt that it was important to provide all disabled veterans with a solution that would help them have access to medical leave. Here's how our bill works: we accelerate the eligibility process for disabled veterans.''' ,'''I was a big supporter of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. I worked very closely with President Obama on that.''' ,'''I define socialism as the government controlling the means of production. I don't think the answer to some of the big vesting problems we have in this country are to solve them entirely with a government-only solution.''' ,'''I'm immensely proud to be a Democrat because of our party's history of fighting for justice, fairness, and equality. From Roosevelt to Obama, we've worked to bring seniors and children out of poverty, expanded civil rights, supported science and research, and pushed for equality of opportunity.''' ,'''I've said from the beginning that Obamacare is an imperfect piece of legislation that is designed to do a very important thing for this country. It's not perfect, and repealing it is a terrible idea.''' ,'''In 1935, the year Social Security was created, the poverty rate for seniors was over 70%.''' ,'''We have to reverse spending trends that are not job-creating.''' ,'''You can't really yell, 'Charge!' and hope to have your team behind you unless they agree that the hill you are trying to take is a hill you should take.''' ,'''Oil is largely our energy past, and Keystone does little to respond to the actual challenges and opportunities before us.''' ,'''I think dealing with climate change should be a centerpiece of any campaign in the 2020 election cycle. Yet I'm the only one with a bipartisan carbon tax bill.''' ,'''Economic policy is like business - it's all about compromise.''' ,'''I am of the view that the Affordable Care Act will be a transformative piece of legislation that can lower the cost of health care in the United States - perhaps our greatest fiscal obstacle - and help all Americans lead healthy and productive lives, free from worry that a single illness could mean ruin for an entire family.''' ,'''America's men and women in uniform bravely defend our nation and our values. Their skill, dedication, and valor are the envy of the world. When their time in uniform is over, they are entitled to world-class health care, a benefit they've earned and that their country is grateful to provide for them.''' ,'''Representative democracy is in crisis in the United States.''' ,'''People ask, 'How do you work with the other side?' Well, I start by not saying bad things about them.''' ,'''The best companies with the strongest credit ratings borrow like the United States: on a non-prioritized basis. This means that in the event of a default, all of their debts are of equal priority because lenders and creditors believe default is highly unlikely. And they spend considerable effort maintaining this status.''' ,'''Climate change is the environmental challenge of this generation, and it is imperative that we act before it's too late.''' ,'''Whether you're a Republican or Democrat, liberal or conservative, it is clear that we've got big problems that we need to address, starting with making our economy more competitive so that we can create more good-paying jobs for the middle class.''' ,'''I support giving President Obama the ability to negotiate and complete new trade agreements with some of the fastest-growing economies in the world.''' ,]
