An initial setback can be a great opportunity to take a new and more promising approach to any problem, to come back stronger than ever.''' ,'''Diplomacy is fundamentally working with people, bringing people together to deal with difficult issues.''' ,'''For the sake of future generations, we must continue to work together to realise a world without nuclear weapons.''' ,]
