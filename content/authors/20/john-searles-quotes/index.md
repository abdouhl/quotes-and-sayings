- I don't write to a genre.
- I usually don't write at night, but there are times where I wake up at 3 in the morning and write all night.
- My writing is sort of 'Sidney Sheldon meets Anne Tyler.'
- My dad was a cross-country truck driver.
- Gone are the days when a publisher could take out an ad, count on a few reviews, and have an author do a couple of signings. Nowadays, readers want to feel a connection with an author.
- I grew up in a two-bedroom house with my grandfather, my mom and dad and four kids. I slept on the couch or on the floor, and I always wanted to have my own space.
- My personality has two sides: a very social side and a reclusive side. I love writing fiction, although I can't imagine ever being locked up in a room writing all the time.
- I always joke deep down I'm really a teenage girl on the inside.
- I always wanted to be a writer.
- I write in the mornings. I get up every morning at about six in the morning and write until nine, hop in the shower and go to work. Nighttime I usually reserve for re-reading what I've done that morning. I would be lying if I said I stuck to that schedule every single day.
- My goal is to write books that are quality books with very real characters and a gripping plot.
- I've gone to readings to see authors after meeting them on Twitter. And while there, I've found myself sitting next to still more writers who I met on Twitter, too.
- I think I'm more sympathetic to writers, to the work and the struggle and the craft of it, than when I was in graduate school at NYU and was very judgmental.
- At the age of 70-something, Helen Gurley Brown was still a woman who knew how to get men to look at her.
- I take stuff from real life and try to make a character out of it. And I try to live the world of the characters a little bit.
- No one in my family had ever even gone to college.
- When I first came to New York, I would scream like a girl and run to the other side of the street if there was a pigeon. Now I can face off with a pigeon.
- A lot of people are afraid of dolls - everybody remembers 'Chucky.'
- Everyone has a ghost story, or at least that's how it has always seemed to me.
- People are often surprised that I am so upbeat. I'm always hearing, 'You're so light and funny, and your books are so dark and twisted.' There's a dichotomy. I like books that are dark and creepy. I don't control it - it's just what I gravitate toward.
- Buying an apartment in New York was beyond my wildest dreams. I had to scrape together every cent to buy it. And I'm so happy I did.
- I love being able to be a writer. That's what I moved to New York to be.
- My first day as an intern in the books department at 'Cosmopolitan' also happened to be the day the O.J. Simpson verdict was announced.
- I stayed at 'Cosmo' well beyond my internship, moving up the ranks over some 15 years to become books editor, then brand director, then editor-at-large - editing everything from an excerpt of Gore Vidal's memoir to writing some of those juicy cover lines myself.
- All my friends are female, I've edited for a magazine for young girls for 15 years, I relate to women, and I'm very, very close to my younger sister.
