- For me from a pretty young age up until about 21 years old hallucinogenics had a huge place in my life.
- We like where we live and we wanna participate in our neighbourhoods and communities and stuff and try to- we're not like benevolent- it's pretty basic.
- When I was seven or eight I was really into Cream, really into Led Zeppelin.
- I think that generally music should be a positive thing, I like Bob Marley's attitude: he said that his goal in life was to single handedly fight all the evil in the world with nothing but music, and when he went to a place he didn't go to play, he went to conquer.
- Phish has never had anything to do with any trends at all in America.
- Where we're living we have a certain amount of our profit every year it's like a percentage 5 or 7% or something like that that we set aside specifically for charity things.
- But I do think that we approach music, in of itself, with a religious attitude.
- I think that Phish has been a band, we've all had- I've had a great life growing up and everybody in my band's had a really good life, none of us have got anything to complain about at all.
- Nirvana was like that- Nirvana was like the only band to come out of that- it was like the same thing, Seattle was like this whole scene and it was like this big scene that was thrust upon America.
- I just wanted to say one more thing: I also think that when you go to play music, you're there to play music.
- You look at the fact that for millions of years species on earth have been developing and we've been knocking them off at like a hundred a day.
- I think that you really don't have a choice, when you see that things are wrong the only choice you really have is to just do what you can to make it better.
- You're not there to spread any particular- if you're Bob Marley you're there to spread a message, but very few people can do that effectively without shoving opinions down someone's throat.
- I mean people have compared us to like the Grateful Dead and all these like psychedelic sixties bands.
- Madonna is a pro. I don't like her and have no respect for her but- I don't think she should be called a musician or a dancer or whatever you know, but I do have, well I do have respect for her ability to completely manipulate the media and have them work for her.
- People are trying to live freely outside of, or within a system that maybe for them on a day-to-day level isn't as free... I definitely think we're positively orientated.
- The Grateful Dead were an influence on our music but they weren't by a long shot the biggest influence.
- When I go on stage man I just want people to have fun, I don't want people to think about their problems, I want people to get energy and nutrition and food from that so they can go back into the real world and work on their problems.
- I think it's like music for the sake of music, and a lot of the words stem from liking music a lot, wanting to be a good band and having a good sense of humour, and living in a situation where we're free to pretty much do what we want.
- I don't know how you can go your whole life and not listen once to Bob Marley - what's the point?
- Led Zeppelin was pretty much what made me pick up drum sticks.
