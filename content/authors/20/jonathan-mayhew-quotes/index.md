quotes = ['''It is our happiness to live under the government of a PRINCE who is satisfied with ruling according to law; as every other good prince will - We enjoy under his administration all the liberty that is proper and expedient for us.''' ,'''Let us all learn to be free, and to be loyal.''' ,'''According to this way of arguing, there will be no true principles in the world; for there are none but what may be wrested and perverted to serve bad purposes, either through the weakness or wickedness of men.''' ,'''There are men who strike at liberty under the term licentiousness.''' ,'''Extremes are dangerous.''' ,'''Not to discontinue our allegiance, in this case, would be to join with the sovereign in promoting the slavery and misery of that society, the welfare of which, we ourselves, as well as our sovereign, are indispensably obliged to secure and promote, as far as in us lies.''' ,'''The only reason of the institution of civil government; and the only rational ground of submission to it, is the common safety and utility.''' ,'''It would be stupid tameness, and unaccountable folly, for whole nations to suffer one unreasonable, ambitious and cruel man, to wanton and riot in their misery.''' ,'''There are others who aim at popularity under the disguise of patriotism.''' ,'''I now add, farther, that the apostle's argument is so far from proving it to be the duty of people to obey, and submit to, such rulers as act in contradiction to the public good, and so to the design of their office, that it proves the direct contrary.''' ,'''All civil rulers, as such, are the ordinance and ministers of God; and they are all, by the nature of their office, and in their respective spheres and stations, bound to consult the public welfare.''' ,'''It becomes us, therefore, to be contented, and dutiful subjects.''' ,'''But let us remember, at the same time, government is sacred, and not to be trifled with.''' ,'''The apostle enters upon his subject thus - Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers; for there is no power but of God: the powers that be, are ordained of God.''' ,'''Let us prize our freedom; but not use our liberty for a cloak of maliciousness.''' ,'''For which reason I would exhort you to pay all due Regard to the government over us; to the KING and all in authority; and to lead a quiet and peaceable life.''' ,'''Till people find themselves greatly abused and oppressed by their governors, they are not apt to complain; and whenever they do, in fact, find themselves thus abused and oppressed, they must be stupid not to complain.''' ,'''Common tyrants, and public oppressors, are not intitled to obedience from their subjects, by virtue of any thing here laid down by the inspired apostle.''' ,]
