- I don't think of it so much as the shows I did or the film sets. I mean, sometimes you'll get a nice location, but it's more, 'Who am I meeting on a day-to-day basis?' Often the rehearsals are a lot more fun than the show itself.
- People want stardom or fame or whatever - instant gratification as opposed to learning one's craft, which, when I was starting out, was the most important thing: that you are as fully equipped for your job or your art as possible.
- It's very hard to do that many things at the same time - having to dance and sing and be on a horse with a sword. It does get quite confusing.
- I grew up riding all my life, so I was very comfy on a horse, thank God. Although I'd never ridden... with sword in my hand.
- I think there are always people that you meet in your life that scare you a little, but not because of the terror in their eyes so much as their unpredictability.
- The next big push in my life is trying to get poetry popular again.
- If you don't travel the world and see as much of it as you can - see different characters in different situations - then how are you going to learn? I figured the best way to do that was to explore as much as I could.
- I want to try and portray characters that are in real life, that you see day-to-day. If I were to just stay in my little village in Wales, I would have gotten a very small taste of a very big plate.
- You see people in different situations behaving in very different ways. That can only benefit you as an actor.
- Working with Ricky Gervais one week, Rutger Hauer another week, John Stamos, was fantastic.
- You use your emotions to try and find them in the character that you're playing.
- I started - well, in England it works a little bit differently. You have to do Fringe theatre, which is basically free theatre. You do it in pubs and small theaters and village halls across the country, and you work for a theatre company. You're part of a troupe.
- It's nice to invest yourself fully in whatever you're doing... I think it's best to try and give everything you've got; otherwise, what's the point?
- I read mostly poetry.
- As an actor, it's so, so rewarding and so pleasing to not be reprimanded.
