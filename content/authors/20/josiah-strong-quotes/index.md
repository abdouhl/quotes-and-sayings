The unoccupied arable lands of the earth are limited, and will soon be taken.''' ,'''It may be easily shown, and is of no small significance, that the two great ideas of which the Anglo-Saxon is the exponent are having a fuller development in the United States than in Great Britain.''' ,'''If I read not amiss, this powerful race will move down upon Mexico, down upon Central and South America, out upon the islands of the sea, over upon Africa and beyond. And can any one doubt that the results of this competition of races will be the 'survival of the fittest?'''' ,'''The rich are richer, and the poor are poorer, in the city than elsewhere; and, as a rule, the greater are the riches of the rich and the poverty of the poor.''' ,'''The city has become a serious menace to our civilization... It has a peculiar attraction for the immigrant.''' ,'''What if it should be God's plan to people the world with better and finer material?''' ,'''Furthermore, it is significant that the marked characteristics of this race are being here emphasized most.''' ,'''The time is coming when the pressure of population on the means of subsistence will be felt here as it is now felt in Europe and Asia. Then will the world enter upon a new stage of its history - the final competition of races, for which the Anglo-Saxon is being schooled.''' ,'''It is not necessary to argue to those for whom I write that the two great needs of mankind, that all men may be lifted up into the light of the highest Christian civilization, are, first, a pure, spiritual Christianity, and second, civil liberty.''' ,'''In Europe the various ranks of society are, like the strata of the earth, fixed and fossilized. There can be no great change without a terrible upheaval, a social earthquake.''' ,'''The city is the nerve center of our civilization. It is also the storm center.''' ,'''Our fifty principal cities contain 39.3 per cent of our entire German population, and 45.8 per cent of the Irish. Our ten larger cities only nine per cent of the entire population, but 23 per cent of the foreign.''' ,'''There the union of Church and State tends strongly to paralyze some of the members of the body of Christ. Here there is no such influence to destroy spiritual life and power.''' ,'''Not only does the proportion of the poor increase with the growth of the city, but their condition becomes more wretched.''' ,'''Here, also, has been evolved the form of government consistent with the largest possible civil liberty.''' ,'''This is due partly to the fact that Americans are much better fed than Europeans, and partly to the undeveloped resources of a new country, but more largely to our climate, which acts as a constant stimulus.''' ,'''Our aristocracy, unlike that of Europe, is open to all comers.''' ,]
