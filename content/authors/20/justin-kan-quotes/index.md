quotes = ['''I've always had the theory that people like watching people.''' ,'''I was always so engrossed with being successful that that was my worth and my identity. And then when things weren't going well, I felt like I was worthless.''' ,'''I actually want to go out and try to date girls. I mean, ones who want to be on camera.''' ,'''At TwitchTV, we think of ourselves as a technology product company, so when we set out to innovate, most often we're trying to improve or build better features for the platform that will improve things for the ecosystem.''' ,'''One of the reasons I think Y Combinator is so powerful is because it creates a new social norm, especially for those who come from outside Silicon Valley.''' ,'''I'm looking for a girl who's an exhibitionist.''' ,'''The original idea for Justin.tv was a terrible idea. So if something like that can eventually become successful, then anyone can be successful.''' ,'''One of the ideas for Justin.tv was that it would force me to go out and be sociable and talk to people.''' ,'''If you look at our original business model with the verticalized law firm, a lot of these companies that have this kind of full stack model are not going to survive. A lot of these companies, Atrium included, did not figure out how to make a dent in operational efficiency.''' ,'''During the pandemic, obviously gaming has become almost like a primary activity. People are at home all the time, they need to entertain themselves, gaming has seen huge growth in all the gaming companies and so Twitch is no exception.''' ,'''People like the feeling of access that is very raw, unedited, and inspirational.''' ,'''I feel like a lot of the technology that happens in gaming, starts in gaming and it goes broader than gaming.''' ,'''If you look at things that are popular apps, it doesn't mean it's going to stick around.''' ,'''I want to inspire the youth to become entrepreneurs.''' ,'''If justin.tv can succeed, then nobody has an excuse. It was a terrible idea.''' ,'''I think streaming works a lot better from an app.''' ,'''The hardest part about growing has been making sure we can support the community in the same ways that we were able to when TwitchTV was just starting out.''' ,'''The best way to sell your company for a lot of money is to have a good company.''' ,'''I've been an entrepreneur for the past 12 years, since I graduated from Yale undergrad with a degree in Physics and Philosophy, and realized I had no actual marketable job skills.''' ,'''I deleted all the apps. You can actually turn off the App Store. And I gave the passcode to my wife so I didn't have the passcode to reinstall the App Store. And I deleted all social media apps and e-commerce apps.''' ,'''I like to have meetings in the early afternoon.''' ,'''Because our site was live video, and because our backend was extremely unstable, we were always in a PTSD-inducing constant state of stress.''' ,'''The idea was called Justin.tv. The idea behind it was, basically, to create our own live-video streaming show, like 'Big Brother,' about ourselves, these entrepreneurs trying to make a reality show. It was a little bit meta and we launched this show.''' ,'''As a founder, you are a very active component of your company.''' ,'''I went to Yale and I was a physics and philosophy undergrad, graduated in 2005.''' ,'''Having a start-up is all about being able to see what works and change your idea.''' ,'''Inspirational content really resonates, like how to raise venture capital.''' ,'''When we started, the Internet was America. If you weren't there, you weren't a company.''' ,'''To me, e-sports is like poker.

We spread our behavior to those around us, whether passively or on purpose.''' ,'''Most people aren't good at creating generally interesting video.''' ,'''I'm very passionate about mental health and wellness as part of the journey.''' ,'''People want to use products where they feel like the people who deliver those products are invested in making it better for them.''' ,'''The big thing was realizing for myself that I had tied my ego to the outcomes and to startups.''' ,'''Even though I had accomplished something astronomical, I looked to my friends who had founded Dropbox and Airbnb, and thought, 'I could've done better.'''' ,'''I usually float between the tech and the business sides of the office.''' ,'''Extrinsic motivations are like, 'I wanna get rich, I wanna be famous.'... Even missionary ones like, 'I wanna change the world with this idea.'... That's an extrinsic motivation. And when things are hard, you're going to be like, oh why am I doing this?''' ,'''As a young founder in high-stress situations, I often used alcohol to escape facing things. I've struggled with this for a long time, and while I think I've gotten better over time, I believe that this is the last thing preventing me from actualizing my 100 percent conscious self.''' ,'''If you burn out you aren't doing your customers or your investors or your employees any favors. You need to create a situation inside your company where you are going to be retained for a long time.

You have to address it head on and take your beating. Always take your beating.''' ,'''For gamers, I think it's very easy for people to produce content that's pretty engaging.''' ,'''Companies are bought not sold, an investment banker told me that once and it is very true. Basically what it means is you can't control selling your company, you can only sell it if somebody wants to buy it, and you need someone to want to buy it.''' ,'''The original concept for JTV was that we would give people a window into other people's lives. The problem is that if that window is 24/7, when you look in at any random moment, odds are you are going to be bored.''' ,'''Eventually my ego is going to be the size of the planet Earth.''' ,'''I try to work the hardest I can without burning myself out. It's not that I think working all the time is the key to success. It's just the way I was raised.''' ,'''We see ourselves as part of a larger gaming ecosystem: You've got broadcasters, game developers, sponsors, and of course the video platforms like TwitchTV.''' ,'''One of the things big law partners say when they talk about Atrium is that we get people who wouldn't make partner. And I say, they're the people who are doing the work for you anyway, but they transition out because they hate the lifestyle.''' ,'''There was no real plan B. It was like, I'm gonna move back to Seattle and move in with my parents.''' ,'''For most people, startups are a risky endeavor and something to be avoided.

Our opportunity cost was playing 'World of Warcraft' and drinking beer. We thought it was a good time to try something.''' ,'''It helps tremendously to have operating startup experience when advising startups. It is much easier to tell people how to talk to customers, build product, manage an engineering team, raise money from investors, and talk to press when you've done it before yourself.''' ,'''That constant need to do better and better is what drove me to start more and more companies - but it wasn't enough.''' ,'''The Internet is a place that fosters creativity.''' ,'''When you're a startup, your edge is that you don't have that many customers. So you can build a really strong relationship with them.''' ,'''I think when you start talking about selling a company or a company wants to buy you, then you start thinking about how much money you're going to have. That's insidious because it saps your will to continue.''' ,'''You can be burned out no matter how successful you are, and you can be unhappy no matter how successful you are.''' ,'''Surround yourself with people who do what you want to do, and eventually you'll wake up to find yourself doing the same.''' ,'''I grew up in Seattle.''' ,'''I don't feel productive if I'm not working a lot.''' ,'''Our goal has always been to make broadcasters on TwitchTV feel like they own their channel pages, and we're continuing to make incremental improvements there.''' ,'''Today, I have an understanding of the world, and of the entertainment and media industries, of how people consume content.''' ,'''I like the idea that I can make a big difference to a startup in a short period of time.''' ,'''No matter what I've wanted to accomplish, whether it was raising capital, investing in a startup, or selling a company, legal has always been a cost and a roadblock to the ultimate goal.''' ,'''Ironically, the pursuit of happiness can lead us into the eternal trap of chasing unhappiness.''' ,'''Early-stage startups are all about the founders and team.''' ,'''A lot of people on the business side are really serious. But I like being able to mix content that's me having fun.''' ,'''The unifying factor in my career across investing and entrepreneurship was that the whole time I've basically been an involuntary power user of legal services.''' ,'''In fact, I've had many lawyers who I felt provided excellent advice and service during important decisions or difficult times. That being said, I always wondered why the law firms that serve the most innovative technology companies in the world rarely adopt innovative software or try to improve their business operations.''' ,'''Smart founders are going anywhere to find talent.''' ,'''There's something very satisfying about making anything with your hands.''' ,'''Nothing is better received by a founder than reading about someone being passionate for his or her project.''' ,'''Twitter is a competition to write the most retweeted witticisms.''' ,'''Imagine what you could do if you had the ability to broadcast live video from anywhere, anytime.
