- It's on the people to dictate what is relevant and what is moving.
- What's weird is the Hot Boys and the whole New Orleans Cash Money thing had a really big impact on the Bay when that was popping off. I don't all the way understand it.

- I've seen what you can do in this grassroots, do-it-yourself world, and I've seen how far that can get you. To be iconic, you still need the gatekeepers to open the doors.
- 'Downtown Love.' I made that with one of my homies in New Orleans. The story is tragic, and the song is emotional. It's my favorite. I'm most proud of that; it's such a creative piece.

- What I actually do put much more weight on, in all honesty, is not being critically acclaimed - it's being respected by my OGs. When I talk to E-40 on the phone, every time I talk to him, I'm like, you know, if he tells me I'm doing good, I'm doing good.
- When I sample something, it's just me drawing from what I'm actually into. It's whatever sounds like a good track.

- When you sample something, you're using the crutch of borrowing chords and melodies from a song that's already great, that's already stood the test of time, that's already special. When you're trying to do it all from scratch, you're writing something brand new that has to stand on its own.

- New money is something fun to celebrate if you never had it.
- When you're around somebody like E-40, all you can do is watch and learn, and soak up game.
- I think it's natural for a creative to be sensitive. If I'm in the studio and I write something, I think it's the greatest thing in the world; it's like my baby. I just made something out of thin air that exists now in a tangible form. It's the biggest thrill in my life.
- I grew up in Oakland and Berkeley, California.
- When I was 12 or 13, the hyphy movement was beginning to bubble. And you had local acts such as the Federation or E-40, Mac Dre, and Too Short that the local radio station would play all the time. You'd hear E-40 as much as you'd hear Jay Z.
- I remember, when I was ten, I wanted to look like Em. I had the bleached blonde hair.

- In the past, my process would start with a sample of another song, and I'd chop it up and use that as the basis of the song that I was making.
- When I started making music, I was so heavy into the hyphy movement. That's something you only know so much about if you were right there living in it, submerged in the culture.
- If we're deciding about merch pieces, t-shirts or hats, they have to be well designed and cool enough for somebody to want to buy it and then wear it and walk around advertising me and my music.
- I'm aware that there are a million other people who want what I'm lucky enough to have right now.
- I just hear a beat and start mumbling words. I just hear sounds and rhythms, and it just kind of comes intuitively. Formatting a song, figuring out a flow, how I respond to the beat.
- Rapping was something I always wanted to do, so after school, my friends and I would catch the bus to my house and just sit there writing songs, every day.
- I love being in a room in front of an audience who cares about the music, who knows the music, and who has lived with the music. It's kind of like an experience you share. I'm on stage performing it, but they're singing the words, too.

- I like to have a lot of girls over and play loud music.
- I played shows in front of like 25, 50 people, and it's a lot harder to do your thing in front of a crowd that's small.
- We used to approach a small 400-person show like an arena show, as if I was a star and I was coming out on stage in front of screaming people and that I was to be larger than life.
- I used to go and cop stacks of blanks CDs and sit there and burn copies of my mixtapes and print up my own mixtape covers and post up in downtown Oakland and Telegraph in Berkeley and literally was selling my mixtapes for five bucks, hand-to-hand.
- Just wearing all black comes from Johnny Cash. I'm on the road so much that if I wear all black, my clothes never get dirty. You can't tell if I've worn the same shirt twice.

- I'll be a Bay kid for the rest of my life. That's in my veins; that's in my bones.

- I would never consider myself a role model in the wide sense of the word.
- You open up a lot of tours making nothing just for the fact that you need to start somewhere and get some exposure. When you start to headline your tours, all the money is in headlining, but there's no money in headlining small rooms.
- When I first decided I wanted to make beats and write songs and stuff like that, it wasn't like I sat down and the first thing I wrote was even halfway legit. It took a while to find my way through it.
- I've definitely grown and evolved as a person, as an artist, you know. Just in terms of my style, my taste, my influences, everything... That's a part of being an artist I think.
- Whenever I can squeeze it in, I'm writing and recording.
- I wanna put numbers on the board. And the thing that everybody doesn't get is that it just doesn't happen. It doesn't just fall out of the air and land on your lap; the only way to get it is to get it and put the work in.

- I know what it feels like to walk out in front of a sold-out crowd of a thousand people that are there for you, and how good that feels, but as an opener, you just have to train yourself to think that it's going to be harder.
- I got my start in small dive bars in New Orleans.
- I was fortunate to have teachers that were flexible with allowing me to miss more class than I was supposed to be able to, for the sake of being able to tour.

- I was making all my own beats, and I really liked sampling stuff, like old '50s and '60s pop and soul and doo-wop records. I was chopping those up and putting loops and drums on them and just rapping over them.
- I read the Steve Jobs book, and that kind of changed everything. I've been, like, an Apple geek my whole life and have always seen him as a hero. But reading the book, and learning about how he built the company, and maintaining that corporate culture and all that, I think that influenced me a lot.
- I grew up in Oakland, California, and there was a really active scene in the Bay Area. Everyone else knew it as the 'Hyphy Movement' of Mac Dre, E-40, and The Pack.
- Time is a finite resource that you can't get back. I have the same 24 hours you have, and you get the same 24 hours as me. As you rise, so does you chance for opportunity.
- I'm the type of person that rises to the occasion, and when work is in front of me, I do work.
- Sometimes you wake up the next morning after making a lot of bad decisions and have this nonchalant reaction like, 'These Things Happen' - what can I say?
- When you use a sample in a big way, when you loop something in the way I did with 'Runaround Sue,' it's like you have your chords and your melody and the quality of the song right there before you add your own production. It's like the song is already made, in a sense.
- I was slicking my hair back when I was in sixth grade.
- 'Runaround Sue' was a big record for me, as well as the music video for it.
- I thought everybody unanimously hated this man. I don't know anyone who was like, 'Go Trump.' I was surprised.
- I've got some growing up to do.
- Growing up, I heard as much E-40 and Mac Dre on the radio as I did 50 Cent. It's in our culture to support our own.

- The Bay area made me who I am, and it only felt right to go back there.
- Touring is starting to feel more like home than home does.
- I wanted to make an album that plays from the top to bottom and feels together and complete. That's just something that felt important.
- I think, back in the day, when I was first starting to make music, all I wanted to do was to get a record deal.

- I'm not inherently the most politically or, like, socially conscious rapper, you know? You're not just going to wake up tomorrow and be Common.

- You have an entire generation of kids who grew up with the idea that music is something that you can download for free.
- Growing up in the Bay, I was still looking for a lot of East Coast hip-hop. I had an older homie put me on to a lot of stuff like Nas' 'Illmatic.'
- There's multiple ways I express myself. Music is my first love and will always come first. But, there are other areas and industries I'm interested in that reflect different aspects of my lifestyle.
- There's only so much you can do on a physical level trying to tour or pass out mixtapes. Although that matters, I realized that you can reach more people putting your music on Soundcloud and networking with blogs to write about you. It really comes back to the music and what you release.
- I try to find 15 minutes a day to just be alone without any distractions just for headspace to meditate and get my Zen on. I think that helps me get through the hecticness of the day on tour with the interviews, the sound check, the meet and greets, the show and the post-show meet and greets.
- That's the nature of this business. Something that took ten years to make can crumble in an instant. It could be snatched away from you at any moment.
- When you're from the Bay Area, there's this chip on your shoulder that you inherently come up with, because us, as a region, we've been overlooked in the grand scheme of the history of the genre and the culture.
- You can tell when someone is reading the lines of a song or performing it.
- We listen to oldies when we go on tour. Beach Boys radio was really clutch; that was definitely our favorite Pandora station.

- It's just crazy to look back at what I was wearing in high school.

- Much respect to Eminem - he's the greatest.
- I actually went to high school with Lil Uno.
- Me personally, I'm real close to my mom. She raised me. It was a single-parent home situation. She did everything: cooked, worked two jobs, came home late, but she loved me to death.
- I grew up with the Pack. When they released 'Vans,' it was a seeing-is-believing moment.
- You have this ability in hip hop to be invincibly cool, and that is a part of G-Eazy.
- I'm on Tumblr all the time.
- For whatever reason, it's easier to perform in front of a massive crowd than in front of a small one, but again, that's how we came up.
- Music is one of the toughest industries, so I respect everybody who has travelled any distance, come far in this music business and achieved anything because it is so hard, and there are so many people out there these days.
- It was inspiring to see local legends like E-40 and Keak da Sneak break out with 'Tell Me When to Go.'
- I didn't grow up around all white people; I never wanted to gentrify hip-hop, I've never wanted to speak to an all-white audience.
- In my opinion, creative control means a lot, I feel like I'm really in touch with who my fans are and what they like about my music, and I'm able to communicate directly with them.
- Music is only special when it's coming from a genuine place - it's just energy trapped in a bottle.
- Albums serve as paragraphs in an artist's autobiography.
- A halfway decent haircut will go a long way!
- My music is very reminiscent of the sound I grew up on and the place where that happened. It's a combination of everything I'm inspired by.
- I'm really attracted to girls who are passionate about music because that's what I'm obsessed with.
- I stick with a '60s vintage aesthetic of letterman's jackets, plain T-shirts, and good jeans.
- I've always dreamt big and the dream is to keep making music.
- It's our approach to treat each show like an arena show. We over-invest in production to make the stage look bigger, turning the show into an experience and not just somebody standing around with a microphone rapping.
