- I'm a bad interview because I want to always feel like I'm being totally honest, but at the same time, I'm absolutely paranoid. That combination results in a lot of spaces.
- My interests are not really with television, per se.
- You are preparing yourself for a scene, and the most important thing is to remain emotionally available and remain in the moment with your scene partner. You don't want to let your own self-consciousness block the flow of creativity that's coming out so that you can act and react, and play what the scene is all about.
- If anyone can crack the publicity nut and figure out how to not come across hammy and contrived, I'd love to talk to them.
- Some say that Jesus is the rock, or the anchor. I say that your friends and family are your anchor. And you can really hold their hands, not just sing about it. No disrespect to George Jones.
- I started studying at 26. Before that, I never thought of acting as something that I would ever try.
- My first manager, Suzanne DeWalt, saw a play I was in. She was invited by the director Joan Scheckel, who was my first real acting teacher. Joan was also good friends with my friend Susie Landau Finch, who had first encouraged me to consider acting, so that's how I began studying.
- I'm more interested in the quality of the work than its medium.
- After I began to explore what an actor actually is, I studied for three years before I had the guts to go on an audition.
- You have to like your character, because if you don't, no one else will either.
