- My body doesn't look like it did before. It's changed after having a baby... it's not better or worse, just different.
- I always loved women that looked strong and active, actual athletes, that's the sort of women I looked up to.
- I've grown up with a really strong group of women around - my mum, sister and auntie, and I've had the same five girl mates since school.
- Some people can't get access to a gym, some people can't afford the gym. So I used to do workouts at home as well. I just tried to make it more approachable for everybody really.
- I love a fresh coffee in the morning and one with a snack mid-afternoon. But I'm strict I don't have it after 4 in the afternoon as it stays in your system for too long and I don't want it to affect my sleep as I have to been dozing off by 10 o'clock to get up for half four.
- I've been approached a few times to write a book, but it's always a concept or a plan that I've not actually done myself.
- As women, I think we lower our standards of what we expect of ourselves. Don't just stay at home and do jumping jacks and leave the gym space to the gym. You have every right to be in the gym - for your health, and so you've got energy for your kids.
- I never wanted to be the person snapping back into shape after a baby. I never wanted to do that, it was never an aim of mine at all.
- Growing up, I held back a lot in fear of looking silly or thinking I wouldn't make it.
- I always have three eggs, either as an omelette, scrambled and poached. I'll serve it with half an avocado and kale or spinach. It's my staple and takes just 5 minutes to prepare.
- I always say to any new mums, make sure you get your doctor's approval - wait at least 12 weeks before you do any exercise.
- Since reading Cameron Diaz's 'The Body Book', I follow her routine of drinking a pint of water first thing. It rehydrates and wakes me up immediately.
- We need a routine to stay challenged - even if you are not working, don't treat every day as Saturday and Sunday.
- I may not be a size eight Victoria's Secret model, but I can squat my own bodyweight, I can run a mile in a great time, I can go on a Stairmaster for 45 minutes without killing myself.
- Strength training has bought me personally so many health benefits. It always annoyed me that women fear they'll get bulky look like a man.
- All my friends with babies or husbands or full time jobs are running ragged looking after everyone and everything around them, but not themselves.
- Women don't give themselves enough credit.
- If, for example, I have a photoshoot that I need to look and feel my best for, then I give myself two weeks and that's it. And I know if I just tighten my diet and up my cardio for those two weeks, I'll be where I need to be and that's because for the rest of the year I stick to the principles of my book.
- Even more so since being a mum, I've got more of a backbone with the decisions I make because you can't pretend to be someone else or to enjoy or dislike something just to fit in with the crowd.
- I didn't have any specific gym training, my parents weren't athletes and I wasn't born into the fitness industry.
- Motherhood's a gift denied to so many women who are so deserving of babies, so whenever I feel like I need a good whinge, I remind myself how lucky I am to even be a mum.
- From the minute you find out you're pregnant, I believe it's a workout, because you're constantly trying to monitor what you eat and what you do, especially for the first three months. I was a nervous wreck.
- I try not to wear too much make-up when I'm not working because I have so much caked on for Strictly. But I always think an under eye concealer is great for banishing dark circles, plus a bit of blush. With flushed cheeks and no bags, you're good to go.
- It's a responsibility as a parent to a human and a parent to a dog. Situations can happen, a dog can react if it's feeling threatened or frightened the same as a human would.
- I actually find stretching so therapeutic. Sundays are my cardio and core days and I always have 15 mins stretch before.
- A pet around a small child teaches them responsibility and passion.
