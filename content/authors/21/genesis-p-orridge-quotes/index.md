In fact, I was the last person he spoke with before he died.''' ,'''We must embrace unity, not separation - sharing, go back to small, caring communities. Unity, not separation, is what has to happen.''' ,'''To be an 'artist' is as much a calling from and to a divine service as becoming a physician, nurse, priest, shaman, or healer.''' ,'''Haircuts are luxuries and, as such, should be as expensive as you can possibly afford.''' ,'''Brian Jones had this really ethereal atmosphere around him.''' ,'''Even if the world outside is destroying itself and fragmented and paranoid and fearful, the job of the artist is to embrace and hold people and say, 'It's OK, be safe here.'''' ,'''We don't agree with Caitlyn Jenner deciding she is the spokesperson for trans people.''' ,'''It has always been my belief that creation, the making of 'art' in any medium or combination of mediums, is a holy act.''' ,'''Curiosity is a great weapon for the artist.''' ,'''I think one of the gorgeous things about TG is that we will go from something amazingly serious and important and significant in terms of the world and life, and then do something ludicrous and absurd.''' ,'''Life and art are inseparable.''' ,'''Once you're looking for wisdom, you have to look at why things happen and why people behave how they do: you cannot, in all conscience, accept any form of prejudice.''' ,'''In the old days, maybe we'd come across Captain Beefheart, buy a record, go, 'This is great!' and notice how his music is evolving, changing, and becoming more complex, more radical. And we would follow that progression and see it reflected in the alternative culture it came from.''' ,'''Change comes from reflection.''' ,'''If we confound and break up the proposed unfolding the world impresses upon us, we can give ourselves the space to consider what we want to be as a species.''' ,'''The good thing about people who are corporate is that they're stupid. So they can be touching something that's precious or radical or special, and they miss the point completely.''' ,'''Within TG, we liberated the use of the lyric forever. There was no longer a taboo on what could be discussed in the conceptual format of a song.''' ,'''I would experiment with porridge - make porridge pancakes, fry porridge - and so friends started calling me 'Porridge.'

No sense is good. And nonsense is good.''' ,'''The status quo is presented as something to aspire to, whereas for us, the status quo was something we wanted to shatter in order to create the space for people to choose for themselves.''' ,'''I am so sick and tired of being told what I'm supposed to look like!''' ,'''Any artist should stay challenged as long as possible.''' ,'''I've had all my teeth replaced with solid gold replicas of the originals.''' ,'''I've always aimed to create something pure.''' ,'''I think we can only ultimately change the world by example and by fearlessly embracing what could happen.''' ,'''I believe in being completely open to the most unlikely explanation.''' ,'''I have no idea what's going on in the fashion industry.''' ,'''Pleasure is a cultural weapon. Use it wisely.''' ,'''When the blues came out, it was something pure and undefined, but when all these white groups got hold of it, it became something else that didn't sound anything like the original. So you had Led Zeppelin doing their thing, which had come all the way from the blues.''' ,'''Imagination should always be treasured, even when it's slightly off-key.''' ,''''Pagan Day' was Alex Fergusson's idea. It was him that encouraged me to start making music again and start Psychic TV.''' ,'''We've always said Psychic TV's music is the sum total of who's in it at the time.''' ,'''I guess I'm dedicated to breaking every inherited mould I can in my private life.''' ,'''We all fall into biological and mental habits. It's an easy way for us to navigate day-to-day work and life, but it also doesn't do us any favours in terms of growing into wisdom, growing into a greater understanding of each other, growing into a deeper relationship - all the things that we really crave.''' ,'''When Lady Gaga wears a meat dress, it's meant to be controversial, but then it turns into money, and it's all fine.''' ,'''People have become obsessed with the greed of celebrity and self-branding and wanting to be known and recognized and succeed in some way, and they're not prepared to share and help each other.''' ,'''Celebrity haircuts are one of the great perks of even a little media profile.''' ,'''The great irony was that the punks were more conservative and narrow-minded and musically bigoted that anyone else.''' ,'''Once you believe things are permanent, you're trapped in a world without doors.''' ,'''In the art world, sentimentality and intimacy and the emotive side of lives are considered very uncool. There's nervousness around intimacy.''' ,'''I really feel that I've been unjustly exorcised from the story of psychedelic music.''' ,'''My mind jumbles things, reassembles them, and plays with words without even being asked.''' ,'''Everyone knows that when things are out of balance, things go wrong.''' ,'''I'm not a man trapped in a woman's body. I'm a brain trapped in a human body.''' ,'''As a little boy, I never felt comfortable with being human.''' ,'''There is no distinction between reverence for existence and our senses and/or apathy.''' ,'''I think, with TG, in our own ways, we have been committed to the idea of evolution on some level and change on some level - that human behaviour may not be changeable, but one has to try and be optimistic and work towards content that might signify change.''' ,'''The punk rockers said, 'Learn three chords and form a band.' And we thought, 'Why learn any chords?' We wanted to make music like Ford made cars on the industrial belt. Industrial music for industrial people.''' ,'''A lot of the conceptualists and the prestige galleries are debasing themselves in presentations which have little else to them but the presentation.''' ,'''Change is not a linear process; it's an all-encompassing process, and it's alive in different ways.''' ,'''Somebody once asked me, 'What do you do?' and I flippantly answered 'I'm a cultural engineer.' With hindsight, I kind of am - but if I got too self-conscious about it, it wouldn't work.''' ,'''The human body is not the person.

The mind is the person.''' ,'''Once you have a hit, it just becomes another old song.''' ,'''Girls together getting dressed up can be really good fun.''' ,'''Ian Curtis was a young genius.''' ,'''England was very frustrating in the Seventies for anyone who was trying to wake up.

He lied about his age because he wanted to ride the fastest motorbikes, which were with the British army.''' ,'''We live in this miraculous technological environment, and yet our human behaviour is still governed by basic impulses from prehistoric times.''' ,'''Humans have to realise they're not individuals but individual parts of the same organism, with responsibility to each other.''' ,'''Everything we do is art, philosophy, mysticism, cultural commentary.''' ,'''All the great artists illustrate their approach to life in the work they make.''' ,''''Star Trek' works for me because it deals with the petty issues of humankind.''' ,'''The gender is irrelevant; the identity is the one you should try and create for yourself by yourself, and the narrative of your own life becomes your own book.''' ,'''I met William Burroughs in 1971. I got his address through a magazine and went to London to spend time with him.''' ,'''Lady Jaye dressed me in her clothes the first day we met. The love we had was so strong, we wished we could become one. Then we thought, 'Why shouldn't we?'''' ,'''The biggest way to say, philosophically, you'll never be part of a war is to look completely the opposite of anyone in a war.''' ,'''Mick Jagger is 70 and still singing 'Satisfaction' every concert. That would drive me insane.''' ,'''I've discovered the joys of happiness.''' ,'''I always felt that everything that happened was incredibly exhilarating and massively puzzling at the same time.

And I would go into this tomb, this cave that I had made, and would lie there, meditating, for hours.''' ,'''My artwork is in order to seduce people into thinking.''' ,'''Humanity is a virus.''' ,'''The great irony was that, while I was being portrayed as a monster, I was in Khatmandu with my children, doing soup kitchens for Tibetan refugees, using all the money from my records to feed three hundred people a day, and working with monks connected to the Sammye Ling Buddhist centre in Scotland.''' ,'''There's a moment for everybody when you look at that picture of Jesus in the church and think, 'This doesn't totally make sense.' If God made everything, then who made God? We have no idea.''' ,'''What's incredible with Trent Reznor is how he took all the alienation and the rejection of traditional rock and found a way to encapsulate it in a form that made the public finally get industrial music.''' ,'''I refer to myself as 'we.'''' ,'''Human beings are not capable of creating a thought that truly conceives of this existence. Nobody knows if we are really here, alive, or anything. It's a mystery.''' ,'''Everything in our world tends to be built on either/ors, and either/ors inevitably make enemies.''' ,'''Why is there no cure for cancer? Because the medical industry doesn't want one! And the pharmaceutical industry doesn't want one! Because they would lose too much money!''' ,'''A real New Yorker is always someone who came here from somewhere else to avoid some kind of persecution, often sexual-preference based, or to be discovered in one of the infinite-though-no-longer-thriving alternative scenes, i.e. theater, music, dance, vaudeville, art, drag, or, in those of the greatest egos, to be 'the next Andy Warhol.'''' ,'''Everyone is telling the truth all of the time... well, it's just that times change.''' ,'''Every few years, you have to change your strategy. You have to look at how the world is mutating, and mutate. Not in the same way but in parallel.''' ,'''Me and Lady Jaye hung out with Anita Pallenberg a few times in the house she lived in with Brian Jones.''' ,'''There's always a way to say something that could seem really commonplace and make it special again.''' ,'''You have an absolute right to translate poetry in any form with any sound. It's all up for grabs.''' ,'''We should always be looking for the unity in things instead of the differences.''' ,'''I've always felt that all the music I've made is psychedelic, including Throbbing Gristle.''' ,'''It turns out that there's a huge community of African-American musicians whose main influence is Throbbing Gristle.''' ,'''Lady Jaye and I always thought black eyes were really sexy.''' ,'''All the people at university were very aristocratic - except me, because I was on scholarship. And everyone there voluntarily wore suits and ties every day. And this was in the '60s!''' ,'''Writing is a recording that you can cut up and reassemble. Sound is something you can cut up and reassemble. Film, video - you know, the main tools of culture - can all be cut up and reassembled.''' ,'''We were already, in 1981, bemoaning the fact that people were using certain accessorised ideas and images that they connected with us - sort of strange buildings and neo-fascist regimes and the 'dark side' of human culture.''' ,'''Things don't happen in a vacuum, and artists don't make work in a vacuum.''' ,]
