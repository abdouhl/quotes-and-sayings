quotes = ['''My long hair and the sideburns made me stand out, really, because my hairstyle was completely different to the other footballers of that era.''' ,'''From the FA to UEFA and FIFA, there's a naivety, a lack of knowledge and understanding and packed with people who are out of touch.''' ,'''I rate Fabien Barthez and played with two great keepers in Alex Stepney and Harry Gregg.''' ,'''Drink is the only opponent I have been unable to beat.''' ,'''I'm lucky that, despite all the bad press I've had over the years, the public still seems to like me.''' ,'''I spent a lot of money on booze, birds and fast cars. The rest I just squandered.''' ,'''I noticed that when I touched the ball on the field, you could hear this shrill noise in the crowd with all the birds screaming like at a Beatles concert.''' ,'''You can't trust very many people.''' ,'''There isn't a single player I would pay to watch. You can say Thierry Henry, he's a fabulous striker, with pace and power, but a great entertainer needs to have charisma, too. Does he have charisma? No.''' ,'''I don't have any regrets.

It can buy you affection but certainly not love.''' ,'''The nice thing is that when people come up to me, it's the football they remember, not all the other rubbish.''' ,'''Players today moan about the number of games, but when you're young, you can't play enough.''' ,'''I was ill, and everyone could see it but me.''' ,'''I was the one who took football off the back pages and put it on to page one.''' ,'''It's a big compliment that so many people want to see me. For them, it's all about football. That's what they remember about me.''' ,'''Football is big business - you can't get away from it. But you have to separate that side from the playing.''' ,'''Football is a sad game.''' ,'''I was 19 or 20 when The Beatles were at their peak, and I was coming up to the peak of my career, too. I was also the first footballer to have long hair, and that's how I got my nickname 'the Fifth Beatle.'''' ,'''Dave Mackay is my definition of a superstar. The man broke his leg three times, but wouldn't be carried off. He walked off.''' ,'''I used to dream about taking the ball 'round the keeper, stopping it on the line, and then getting on my hands and knees and heading it into the net. When I scored against Benfica in the 1968 European Cup final, I nearly did it. I left the keeper for dead, but then I chickened out.''' ,'''David Beckham has never impressed me.''' ,'''It all went wrong with football, the thing I loved most of all, and from there, my life slowly fell apart.''' ,'''I've always been a bit of a gypsy.''' ,'''As long as I stay in training and play well, I don't see what objection there can be to what I do off the field.''' ,'''That thing about being an icon, the fifth Beatle, I just found it so freaky.''' ,'''The people of Northern Ireland have sorted out my whole life.''' ,'''I dressed more like a pop star, I suppose, rather than the traditional blazer and tall trousers other players went for.''' ,'''I was born with a great gift, and sometimes with that comes a destructive streak.''' ,'''The best thing about being a dad? Well, I think it's just the thing that every man wants - to have a son and heir.''' ,'''They'll forget all the rubbish when I've gone, and they'll remember the football. If only one person thinks I'm the best player in the world, that's good enough for me.''' ,'''If I'd been born ugly, you'd never have heard of Pele.''' ,'''When I look back on my life as a whole, it is impossible for me not to feel blessed.''' ,'''There are so many memories for me in Manchester. Everywhere I go, I think, 'I used to have boutiques here, clubs there, restaurants in that area.'''' ,'''If you make up your own mind, you can only blame yourself.''' ,'''I used to go missing a lot... Miss Canada, Miss United Kingdom, Miss World.''' ,'''I'd have to be superman to do some of the things I'm supposed to have done, I've been at six different places at six different times.''' ,'''Nobody knows me.''' ,'''I got my buzz from playing.''' ,'''I even found it difficult to watch myself playing on TV because I couldn't identify with the person on the screen. I couldn't get to grips with it.

Every week was a big game and a big battle.''' ,'''I was probably the first footballer ever to have a pop-star profile, and my agent was right when he said we could put my name on stair rods and sell them to people in bungalows.''' ,'''One reason I don't want to play in England again is because we don't have any personalities.''' ,'''The onus is on the managers to send out an attacking formation and to tell their players to be bold.''' ,'''Maybe 'loner' is too strong a word, but I've always enjoyed being on my own.''' ,]
