- I think in my own country, at the way we've seen through the ordination of women to the priesthood, which I'm delighted about, and that will move on to another level before very long.
- The Israelis have suffered a great deal, we must condemn suicide bombers, and we must never say that the plight of the Palestinians justifies this terrible thing.

- We must get back to a very strong Christianity... Christianity shaped America and England, and we need to get back to those moral foundations that made us great.
