I let them bellow at me for just as long as it took me to find enough pluck to bellow back at them.''' ,'''It's an old ploy of the bourgeoisie. They keep a standing 'art' to defend their collapsing culture.''' ,'''The bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie have armed themselves against the rising proletariat with, among other things, 'culture.'''' ,'''I was disappointed, not because we had lost the war but because our people had allowed it to go on for so many years, instead of heeding the few voices of protest against all that mass insanity and slaughter.''' ,'''Very little changed fundamentally, except that the proud German soldier had turned into a defeated bundle of misery and the great German army had disintegrated.''' ,'''I had grown up in a humanist atmosphere, and war to me was never anything but horror, mutilation and senseless destruction, and I knew that many great and wise people felt the same way about it.''' ,'''I stood up as best I could to their disgusting stupidity and brutality, but I did not, of course, manage to beat them at their own game.
