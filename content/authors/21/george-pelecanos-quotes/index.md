- My goal is to get a real film industry started in Washington. An actual one, not where features come to town and shoot second unit for a few days. I would love to get something started here. Hire local crews. People could work year-round and raise their families here.
- 'The Deuce' came about when David Simon and I were put in contact with a guy who, along with his twin brother, owned a couple bars in Times Square.
- There was a hole in Washington fiction, I felt, when I started out. Most D.C. novels were about politics or the federal city or people who lived in Georgetown or Chevy Chase - it was definitely a very narrow focus.
- I do miss the Chocolate City of my youth.
- When I was a kid in the '60s, I went shopping in downtown Silver Spring. Hecht's, JCPenney, the little retailers - they sponsored all my sports teams.
- Sometimes there's a reason for the hype.
- I'm always working on my next novel, even when I'm not.
- I really feel like people who want to change things need to go out and change it themselves and not look to politicians to do that.
- A lot of guys are walking around with a lot simmering beneath the surface, and sometimes it explodes.
- I like fiction set in the South, and I'm a fan of literary westerns.
- Richmond Fontaine bandleader Willy Vlautin writes songs akin to finely composed short stories set in the diners, bars, casinos, and old hotels of Reno and its environs.
- As far as I'm concerned, the voices of Washington, black Washington, it's poetry, man. There's beauty in it.
- I even dream about writing. I'm talking seeing words across the page, whole paragraphs.
- Guys who feel like it makes you a man to make babies, they're completely misguided. It makes you a man to be a father. And I'm not moralising about marriage or anything. I understand that people split up, and marriages don't work out, and people do the best they can. But if you're going to not be there from the very beginning, then don't do it.
- Where I live, there are a lot of businesses owned by Ethiopians and Eritreans. They're the new immigrants, the new Greeks - what my people did. The next generation of these people will probably be college graduates. That's how it works, right there in front of your eyes.
- Can't get my head around sci-fi or fantasy. I'm not putting those genres down; it's just that I'm not built for them.
- I never went to a writing school, so 'The Wire' was my writing school.
- I go to church for the cultural element. It's where you go to see Greek people once a week. It's real important to me, and I hope my children see they're part of something bigger than just this family.
- Kids need a father around to make them whole. They need their mom.
- 'The Turnaround' isn't even really a crime novel. But you need conflict to make a novel, any kind of novel, and I don't know any other way to do it than crime.
- It's relatively easy to adopt kids if you're not trying to get kids that look exactly like you.
- I always overtip. When I go to England, people think I'm stupid.
- It would probably surprise people how prevalent reading is in institutions - and the degree to which some states discourage reading by instituting draconian rules and laws that try to limit and outright roadblock books in prisons.
- I never went to school for writing, never took a writing class, but when you're in a room with David Simon and Ed Burns and Dennis Lehane and Richard Price, and they're going over something you've written, you learn what works and what doesn't.
- When I was a teenager, I thought if any of my friends or people at school see me reading a book, they're gonna think I'm weak. So I didn't even do it in private. Then I grew up, got into college, and the teachers turned me on to books, and I got hooked.
- I am on my bike daily, and most of the locations, warehouses and specific residences from 'The Cut' were found while I was riding.
- I've just been very interested in the living side of Washington, rather than the federal side, since I was a kid.
- I was heavily into John D. MacDonald.
- The cliche is that Washington is a transient town of people who blow in and out every four years with the new administrations. But the reality is that people have lived in Washington for generations, and their lives are worth examining, I think.
- At 11 years old, in 1968, my job was to deliver food on foot, so I spent my day walking around the city. I had an active imagination, jacked up by movies. I passed the time making up stories and serializing them.

- I've been working in adult prisons and juvenile prisons for some time.

- There's nothing funny about violence. Death is a real thing.
- When I was 19, my dad got sick, and I quit college to take over his business, a coffee shop on 19th Street, below Dupont Circle in D.C. I had been working there since I was 11 years old, so it was not a stretch to think that I could do it, but my record as a teenager, in many respects, was less than stellar.
- I shoot occasionally, but I'm no gun expert.
- Reading opens your mind and helps you understand and empathize with people who are unlike you and outside your breadth of experience.
- I read 'The Washington Post' every day from a very young age. Reading the newspaper taught me how to organize my thoughts on the page. Meaning, it taught me how to write.
- I'm a fast driver.
- There's a room in my house where my stereo, records, CDs, and books are housed. I spend a lot of time in that room, sitting in my chair beside the fireplace, reading and listening to music. Sometimes I just stand before the shelves and look at my books, because every single one of them means something to me.
- Movies were the biggest influence on me when I was a kid.
- My books are not for everybody.
- My goal is to get better with each book, and I feel like I am.
- I've seen firsthand how books can change people's lives. It happened to me.
- What we were all always saying with 'The Wire' was that there's a whole group of people that America just sort of wants to throw away. They want to forget about them, and if they could, they'd get rid of them. They are Americans - they're worth saving; they're worth helping.
- 'Random Rules' kicks off 'American Water,' and from its opening line - 'In 1984 I was hospitalized for approaching perfection' - you know you're in for something strange and special.
- I live in a bigger house, but I still live in the neighbourhood I grew up in.
- Sometimes I think 'The Wire' said it all, and I might as well not write any more crime novels.
- I do feel like that's what a writer does, is he goes into other people's heads.
- 'The Deuce' takes a look at the remarkable paradigm of capitalism and labor: where money goes and how it's routed; who has power and who doesn't; who is exploited and who's not.
- I want to be read. When you write a TV show like 'The Wire,' you've got three to four million readers watching your work. Even Grisham doesn't sell that many books.

- People like to talk to me. I don't know why.

- Many fathers and sons never get to reconcile their differences or come to an understanding that fills the gap between love and expectations.
- I used to sit in my pickup truck at 7 o'clock in the morning outside my office and listen to the Replacements or something full blast, thinking, 'What am I doing here?'
- Until a book starts forming in your head, you always wonder, 'Am I going to be able to do this again?'
- I love writing books, but it's a solitary experience. When I'm on a film set, I'm with a bunch of other artists working together to make one thing.
- My take on gentrification and change is it's usually always a better thing, because when you see all these businesses open and flourishing, that means there are more jobs.
- I was a movie freak before I was a book lover.
- 'The Big Sky' is an American classic.
- I'm a strong believer in second chances.
- I'm proudly a crime writer, but it would be really inaccurate to call me a mystery writer.
- I collect and read as many books about music and film as I do fiction.
- There is nothing like the rumble of a dual-piped American car with something under the hood.
- I was really rudderless at one point my life. And once I started reading books, then I got the idea that maybe I could become a writer. I had a goal. And every day when I got up, there was a reason.
- I get chills when I think that there's a statue of Phil Lynott on a street in Dublin, that people leave flowers by the statue. I love stuff like that.
- For many years, I did ride-alongs with patrol cops, which is any citizen's right.
- I don't judge anyone of any stripe by what they read. Reading is always good for you. It's a positive act.
- Incarcerated individuals want what most people want in a novel: good, honest writing and a story well told.
- I make a good spaghetti sauce and can mix a nice drink.
- I'd get off the set of 'The Wire' at 3 A.M. or even 4 A.M. and drive home to Washington to see my kids sleep and give them a kiss. I'd get up at 7 A.M., while the kids were still in bed, and drive back to Baltimore.
- My sons are black, and my daughter is Latina.
- I was 15 years old in 1972, and yeah, when the 1970s broke, I was out there. Everything was kinda swirling around me - the music, women, cars, the culture.
- My father was a Marine who fought in the Pacific in WW II. He was a very tough guy, but after the war, he lived his life in a quiet and reserved manner because he had nothing to prove. I know now that he internalized his war experience.
- If I had my druthers, I wouldn't have anyone's words in my script but my own, but if you want complete autonomy, just stick to novels.
- I can't relax. I don't have any hobbies.
- I never took a writing class.
- I'm more apt to shed a tear than my wife about family matters.
- I was a child in the '60s and a teenager in the '70s, which was the golden age of film as far as I'm concerned, between American film and the Italian reinvention of genre film.
- I'm a very sentimental, emotional person.
- There's a science to brain development. The brains of teenage boys are crowded with impulse and adrenaline. By the time they hit their 20s, their brains are dominated by conscience and reason.
- In its rather clinical view of death, 'True Grit' rivals the hardboiled world of 'Red Harvest'-era Dashiell Hammett and prefigures Cormac McCarthy by 20 years.
- My father's diner, the Jefferson Coffee Shop, was a simple, 27-seat affair in Washington D.C., open for breakfast and lunch - coffee and eggs in the morning, cold cuts and burgers in the afternoon.
- My senior year at College Park, University of Maryland, I took an elective class in crime fiction taught by Charles C. Mish. He turned me on in a big way to reading and books. I was lucky to have a teacher who changed the course of my life.
- My favorite movies are from the '70s.
- Every young man's best purchase is his first car, which spells freedom. My first one was a '70 Camaro, springtime gold-over-saddle, a 307 with Hi-jackers and chrome reverse mags.
- There are a lot of bars and shoe stores in my early books.
- I'm forever grateful to have had the opportunity to prove myself to my dad. After I took over the diner, the look in my father's eyes went from disappointment to respect.
- Is there a more violent book than the Bible?
- It's a tradition that a writer will try to plant his flag in a certain city and protect that. The way to get your rep is to find the essence of the city and get it down on paper.
- 'Treme' begins after Hurricane Katrina, and it's a year-by-year account of how everyday people there put their lives back together. It's sort of a testament to, or an argument for why, a great American city like New Orleans needs to be saved and preserved.
- I didn't want to write the same book over and over.
- I'm intrigued by people who make their modest living doing good things for others. Teachers, nonprofit workers, librarians... those are the heroes in our society.
- 'True Grit' is one of the few books my sons let me read to them - and paid attention to - when they were younger.
- I like writing about people who spend their time trying to help others for the greater good. That's what Americans are supposed to be about, right?
- I find 'True Grit' to be one of the very best American novels: It is a rousing adventure story and deeply perceptive about the makeup of the American character.
