The existence of the worst evils is unimaginable unless God willed them.''' ,'''Each of us is incomplete compared to someone else - an animal's incomplete compared to a person... and a person compared to God, who is complete only to be imaginary.''' ,'''Eroticism is assenting to life even in death.''' ,'''Sacrifice is nothing other than the production of sacred things.''' ,'''The sovereign being is burdened with a servitude that crushes him, and the condition of free men is deliberate servility.''' ,]
