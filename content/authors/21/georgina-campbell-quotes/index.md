- It happens a lot that women have to play the girlfriend role, which isn't as three-dimensional as the male role.
- Within the media, the way that women are portrayed - especially young women - sometimes there is a lot of sexual objectification and, I would say, 'lad culture.' These are all things that connect with domestic abuse.
- A childhood favourite that has stayed with me over the years is Kate Winslet. She's an amazing British actress who always delivers no matter what role she's in. Another actress I've found incredibly inspiring is Olivia Colman.
- I do think that being a BAME actor does make it difficult to avoid stereotypes.
- I think there's always a way to bring something, even if it is just the girlfriend role, as long as you're playing it with an idea of who that person is on their own, away from the male character.
- I would love to say something really cool, because I did film studies. So, like, a Jean-Luc Goddard film - something like that. But I genuinely would love to be in 'Titanic.' I'm such a loser. That's, like, my childhood film. Like, I love it.
- I'm definitely not that fashion forward.
- Awards do get you 'that profile,' but then you have to do the rest of the work - it's not just a case of 'now you don't have to do anything.'
- The narrative of, 'You won an award, so you're going to skyrocket' - it's very emotive language but not necessarily true. I've definitely got auditions I wouldn't have got before, but it's not like jobs get rained down on you.
- I was 16 and standing on Tottenham Court Road when this woman came over and asked me if I was an actress. She wanted me to audition for an online drama she was directing. I had time to kill, so I thought, 'Why not?'
- I have used dating apps a couple of times in the past and met people, but it is a difficult thing because you're meeting someone who you really don't know and you have no link to. I have friends who have had great relationships after meeting on Tinder or Bumble, so I'd never say never, but it hasn't worked for me.
- I think people in the U.K. should be concerned about the under-representation of BAME actors in TV and Film, because it is an incorrect reflection of our society.
- People who are in abusive relationships often don't realise it, but it slowly seems to build until you're trapped.
- I wanted to be an air hostess because I thought it was the most glamorous thing - and I'd never been on a plane.
- I've always really liked murder mysteries and thrillers, and great to be able to be actually part of one.
- Really good leading roles are few and far between, and there is so much competition because there are so many fantastic actresses in this country.
- I'm not really into destiny, but it's funny - I bumped into a woman who told me about an audition, and now I have a BAFTA.
- When you're an actor, people just take it for granted that you're really confident and can get up in front a stage full of people and just speak to them.
- I certainly didn't have an exciting or a crazy childhood.
- I'm ambivalent about tech.
- I watch everything with Olivia Colman in.
- My mum records everything I'm in on VHS. Like, who still has VHS? I told her it's all online now, but she still tapes it.
- It's a shame that ethnic minorities aren't getting a crack at different types of roles. There needs to be a bit of a change.
- You just never see people of different ethnicities in period dramas.
- I've not been discriminated against, but I can see it happen. And not just race but gender and sexuality, too. It's stereotyping, lazy casting, which is an issue: that people can't see outside the box.
- America seems much more diverse and has more exciting casting - they really take risks.
- Anything in which you're playing someone real does make you feel responsible for making the story as true as it can be.
- It's so hard to get into this industry. There are so many people who are so talented, and they never get those opportunities.
- I'd like to work at the Royal Court Theatre, please.
- If you read the script, and the character's got something in it that you relate to, then I am keen. But I really think, a lot of the time, my successful auditions are those where I really care about the characters.
- Sometimes, with portrayals of domestic violence, the women involved are just victims with no personality, just completely trodden-down. But people continue to live their normal lives: they go out; they continue to have arguments with their partners, even if there is always the fear of where that might end up.
- We've always had a sadistic obsession with technology.
- So many fantastic male characters are brooding, angry, and not nice; that doesn't happen as much with women.
- I don't know if I ever really think about being a role model. But I guess if you're in the public eye and people are looking at what you do, you do want to be a good role model, and you want to kind of be seen in a good light.
- I've always wanted to do a horror film. I don't know if my agent will be happy I said that when I get sent some crap horror films, but I'd like to do a good one, like 'It Follows,' or 'The Babadook.'
