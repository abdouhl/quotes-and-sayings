- Every time I fly first class, I'm like, 'Damn dude, this is sick!'
- When I was eight, I would watch 'Friends' religiously. I had the entire DVD set. That was my whole view of America. That really inspired me to do comedy and acting.
- When I was growing up in Newcastle, there was one other Indian girl, and we got confused for each other constantly.
- I have to say that New York is so different than the New York in 'Friends.'
- I was never a nipper; I was so uncool. I was way too unfit to be a nipper.

- I'm a huge comedy nerd. I have been forever.
- All the excuses that people in power used to make for not telling diverse stories or including diverse people, they've proven to be false.
