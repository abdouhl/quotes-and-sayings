- The three European finals I won, I remember very well.
- If I'm thinking about work, it's easier to block the irrational thoughts out of my mind.
- In Italy, you lose a game, you can't walk out of the stadium without having a police escort. You lose a game in England and you get out and, as long as you've done your best, you are asked to sign autographs and you see the kids and you see everybody and nothing happens.
- A sore ankle, a swollen knee or a bruise makes you feel alive.
- I wasn't particularly good at showing my emotions and I kept things inside. It's not good. Now I realize that whenever I want to cry, I cry.

- To wear the Juventus shirt is an honor, but it's also very heavy.
- Clubs have sponsors. They are just there for commercial reasons but the club calls them partners. Then you have the fans.

- Celebrations have now become too selfish and I don't like it. When I used to score I was happy to celebrate with my team-mates. Now when players score it is all about them.

- They say the Premier League is best league in the world. Or Roy Keane says we are brainwashed into believing it. He might be right. But I can definitely say it's the most entertaining league.
