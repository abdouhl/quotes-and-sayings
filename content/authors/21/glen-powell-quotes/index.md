- The Ryan Murphy universe is a very strange place to occupy, and I would never tell anyone who loves Chad Radwell to ever give up complete hope.
- Everybody talks about how 'Everybody Wants Some!!' is the spiritual sequel to 'Dazed and Confused,' but there's a real trap in trying to recreate 'Dazed and Confused' - that magic is it's own thing.
- I feel like that's the nature of being a young guy - competition brings people closer. That's how I bond with people.
- When I was 16, I'd been cast in 'Fast Food Nation.' And while I was playing in a charity baseball game, I ended up breaking my arm about a week before filming was starting.
- Ryan Murphy is one of the best at creating universes.
- 'Scream Queens' is its own reality.
- It's a tough journey as an actor in Los Angeles.
- You have to learn to be a healthy competitor, winning or losing. Because there can be a lot more losses than there are wins.

- The peacocking nature of baseball players and athletes in general - you're all kinda competing for who's got the most swagger.
- Ryan Murphy is a genius. In terms of television, very few have been as prolific.
- When I read 'Scream Queens' for the first time, I felt the voice of the show was fresh, unapologetic, and non-stop fun.
- When you go to college, and you talk about your college experience, there's a lot of revisionist history that goes along with it. You tend to think of yourself as, 'Oh, I got all of the girls. I was the best athlete on the team. I was a straight-A student.' And that's probably not the case.
- I just love the fact that Sylvester Stallone is a multi-hyphenate. He acts, he writes, he produces, he directs. I always respected that guy, especially with 'The Expendables' franchise, which is very much the type of movie that my dad and I loved when I was a kid.
- My style comes from a very masculine point, and Valentino has a very masculine fit. It's built for corn-fed guys like me.
- If I could make every movie with Richard Linklater, I would.
- There's an energy and intimacy around a foosball table that nothing else compares to.
- My family loves movies. My dad and I used to eat a huge breakfast, and then we'd just go hang out at the theater all day together. We loved movies like 'Indiana Jones' and 'James Bond.' We were both big action-adventure movie fans. So I kind of grew up with an appreciation for film.

- What guy didn't want to be an astronaut growing up?
- There's only so many great movies that come about every year.
- Small screen or big screen my job on set doesn't really change. The only difference with TV is I get to be surprised with new information just like the audience every time I get a script.
- I'm not really a line type of guy. I mean, pick-up lines work for some guys. You gotta really sell that thing hard. I did try one pick-up line, and it failed miserably. I thought it was really funny, but the girl didn't find it very funny.
- When I first moved out to L.A. to be an actor, this family knew that I was a pretty big athlete back in Texas, and they said, 'You can live in our house for free if you coach our kid in football, basketball, and lacrosse.' So I was coaching all these sports teams, and I got to live at this house in Bel Air - this nine-acre estate - for free.
- It's hard because there's a little bit of PTSD from when you're a struggling actor, working at a restaurant or living in a garage. There's a little bit of an inherent knee-jerk reaction to say, 'Yes, yes, yes, please just give me a job.'
- Male bonding is the idea of having the confidence to say, 'I'm going to take you down.'
- The Dicky Dollar Scholars are a little bit of a cartoon bromance. 'Everybody Wants Some!' is probably a little more realistic. I didn't realize that my brand was bromance!
- I've done the day jobs and slung towels at the Beverly Hills Hotel.

- Anybody who knows me knows that I'm a goofy and fun-loving guy.

- Guys all want something beyond what they're being given - in every facet of life.
- Life doesn't come in plot points or setups and payoffs. Life washes over you and passes.
- The basic premise of math is about efficiency. And when you've got racism, sexism, and bigotry, that's just standing in the way of efficiency in our own progress.
