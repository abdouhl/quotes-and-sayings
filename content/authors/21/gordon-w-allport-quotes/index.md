- Scarcely anyone ever wants to be anybody else. However handicapped or unhappy he feels himself, he would not change places with other more fortunate mortals.
- No corner of the world is free from group scorn.
- Mature striving is linked to long-range goals. Thus, the process of becoming is largely a matter of organizing transitory impulses into a pattern of striving and interest in which the element of self-awareness plays a large part.
- What is familiar tends to become a value.
- The primary problem in the psychology of becoming is to account for the transformation by which the unsocialized infant becomes an adult with structured loves, hates, loyalties, and interests, capable of taking his place in a complexly ordered society.
- Self-love, it is obvious, remains always positive and active in our natures.

- A prejudice, unlike a simple misconception, is actively resistant to all evidence that would unseat it.
- Open-mindedness is considered to be a virtue. But, strictly speaking, it cannot occur. A new experience must be redacted into old categories. We cannot handle each event freshly in its own right. If we did so, of what use would past experience be?
- Personality is less a finished product than a transitive process. While it has some stable features, it is at the same time continually undergoing change.
- It takes a major unhappiness, a prolonged and bitter experience, to drive us away from loyalties once formed. And sometimes no amount of punishment can make us repudiate our loyalty.
- Each person is an idiom unto himself, an apparent violation of the syntax of the species.
- To a considerable degree, all minority groups suffer from the same state of marginality with its haunting consequences of insecurity, conflict, and irritation.
- Dogmatism makes for scientific anemia.
