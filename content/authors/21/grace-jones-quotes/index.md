- I love women, but I've never had a relationship with a woman.
- My father would have been made a bishop much earlier than he was had it not been for me and my image.
- Listen to my advice; I have some experience. In a way, it is me being a teacher, which is what I wanted to be. I still feel I could go into teaching. What is teaching but passing on your knowledge to those who are at the beginning? Some people are born with that gift.

- I never thought I was going to be a singer. That was an accident.

- This is what I would say to my pupil: 'You have become only your fame and left behind most of who you were. How are you going to deal with that? Will you lose that person forever? Have you become someone else without really knowing it? Do you always have to stay in character for people to like you? Do you know that you are in character?'.
- Women and men grow up with both sexes. Our mothers and fathers mean a lot to us, so it's just a question of finding a balance between their influences. I've found mine. And it tends to be more on the male side. I mean male side the way we understand it in the West.
- I see myself as no color. I can play the role of a man. I can paint my face white if I want to and play the role of white. I can play a green, I can be a purple. I think I have that kind of frame and that kind of attitude where I can play an animal.
- Shock always sells. You know? But you could shock in good taste.
- Mum was a high-jumper and qualified to go to the Olympics, but it got into the newspapers that she was married to my father, and the church put pressure on her to pull out of the Olympic team, saying, 'You can't be exposing all your legs.' That's how strong the influence of the church was on us all.
- I was the only black girl at my junior high school. I had an afro, a Jamaican accent, I looked really old.

- I was born into a very religious family where everything was about setting the right example for the community and having to obey orders blindly. I felt that everyone was growing up in the world, except me. This is probably one of the reasons why I had such a rebellious attitude towards any form of authority.
- Sometimes we'd have to climb a tree and pick our own whips to be disciplined with. When you had to pick your own whip, you knew you were in for it.
- I like to think of myself as a positive person. Otherwise I wouldn't have had a child.
- You can't expect your children to be perfect.
- I didn't think I had a voice at all, and I still think of myself as an interpreter of songs more than a singer. I thought it was too deep; people thought I was a man. I had a very strong Jamaican accent, too; the accent really messed me up for auditions.
- I like to isolate myself when I work because I end up losing my voice by doing interviews all day.

- I loved all those classic figures from the '30s and '40s... Bette Davis, Joan Crawford, Humphrey Bogart, Rita Hayworth. They had such glamour and style. I loved the movies of those times too - so much attention paid to details, lights, clothing, the way the studios would develop talent.
- Rock n' roll can get quite overwhelming. You can get caught up in the cycle.

- I've turned down millions of dollars to go on reality TV. It's an absolute no-go.
- There will always be a replacement coming along very soon - a newer version, a crazier version, a louder version. So if you haven't got a long-term plan, then you are merely a passing phase, the latest trend, yesterday's event.
- My dad's family were political and he was always a theatrical creature, whereas my mum is really musical and her father was the touring pianist with Nat King Cole. My family was an explosive mixture of politics, religion and music - no wonder I turned out how I did.

- To be honest, my life is not really as way-out and myth-loaded as people like to portray it.

- You had to wear a hat to go to church. We weren't allowed to straighten our hair. We couldn't wear jewellery, nail polish, open backed shoes, skirts above the knee... trousers were forbidden because male apparel on a female was not godly.
- Most performers take themselves too seriously. They forget there is a difference between the characters they play on the screen or stage and themselves, but the public doesn't forget there is a difference. They see how silly it is if you try to be the same person all the time.
- Be like Sasha Fierce. Be like Miley Cyrus. Be like Rihanna. Be like Lady Gaga. Be like Rita Ora and Sia. Be like Madonna. I cannot be like them, except to the extent that they are already being like me.

- It's important that the sexes understand each other.
- I just go with the flow, I follow the yellow brick road. I don't know where it's going to lead me, but I follow it.
- I always had to mask my emotions. I could never show that I missed my mom or my dad, especially when they moved to America. My grandparents were tough. I was not allowed to receive letters that had not been read before. Everything was controlled - everything!
- We're not perfect; we all have things that people might not like to see, and I like to show my faults.
- Models are there to look like mannequins, not like real people. Art and illusion are supposed to be fantasy.

- I was a go-go dancer, too. I called myself 'Grace Mendoza' to fool my parents.
- I only move forwards, never backwards, darling.
- I've had more misrepresentations than I can handle, and people have told the wickedest lies about me. A lot of them have taken their frustrations out on me, and I don't like that because it can wound. Not necessarily me, but those around me. Journalists can be so bad.

- I don't like people who hide things. We're not perfect, we all have things that people might not like to see, and I like to show my faults.

- I'm not a rock star; I'm a soft person.
- They used to call me Firefly when I was a little girl, and I always tried to figure out why I was being called a firefly. I was really black, black, black from the sun. After being in Jamaica for 13 years, my eyes were really beady and white, and my skin was really black. I must have really looked like a fly. My eyes looked like lights, like stars.
- One creates oneself.
- I always thought that feminine, softer side was just too vulnerable to put out there, because then it's like you're opening up a door for everybody to come in, and you don't know who's going to come in that door.
- Now when I enter a carriage, it almost empties. But there's always one brave enough to stay.
- I like conflicts. I love competition. I like discovering things for myself. It's a childlike characteristic, actually. But that gives you a certain amount of power, and people are intimidated by that.
- My mum was very glamorous, an incredible seamstress. She made up those Vogue, Givenchy and Yves St. Laurent patterns they used to sell. It was church couture, darling! Because my dad was a pastor, she could get away with more than other women. Her skirts were that bit tighter.
- Music has its own depths, and I let it take me where it takes me, even if it means stripping all my clothes off.
- I don't collaborate. You're born alone, you die alone, you get on stage alone.
- The problem with the Dorises and the Nicki Minajes and Mileys is that they reach their goal very quickly. There is no long-term vision, and they forget that once you get into that whirlpool, then you have to fight the system that solidifies around you in order to keep being the outsider you claim you represent.
- If you want me to work with you, then come with an idea. Come with music.
- I feel feminine when I feel feminine. I feel masculine when I feel masculine. I am a role switcher.
- Human beings should stick together. Honestly, if I see a red-haired person with blue eyes now, I say, 'Is your granny black?'
- I go feminine, I go masculine. I am both, actually. I think the male side is a bit stronger in me, and I have to tone it down sometimes. I'm not like a normal woman, that's for sure.

- It was very painful combing my hair. My grand-uncle was a Pentecostal bishop, and he was very strict: our hair couldn't be permed or straightened. So I just cut it all off.
- Normally, I stay away from politics - unless I'm going to run for president.
- There is some Eighties music that is just timeless. The melodies, the lyrics... I called it church. Church in club. You can shout and dance. The best of the Eighties was club church.
- I've changed. I'm not worried about what people think, because I think people think what they want to think anyway.
- It's the nature of man to give and receive - to be man and woman, all in one.

- Fear is fear of fear, I think.
- My husband used to shout at my mother, 'What is wrong with your daughter? I'm married to a man.'
- Gaga came to me, and I just could not find a soul. I come from church; maybe that has something to do with it. I like to get to the soul of a person. I just didn't feel a soul.
