- Chicago's always been known as this meat and potatoes place, and a lot of restaurants play that up. They try to outdo each other by adding another 10 ounces, so their 80 ounce steak becomes a 90 ounce steak with 10 pounds of mashed potatoes on the side.
- Kosher salt, eggs and flour. These are the building blocks of everything. Kosher salt, above and beyond everything.

- Barbecue is the good old technique of people making a fire and putting some stuff over the top - I mean, look at the S'more: it's just got a stick.

- I think what somebody orders and how they eat and cook really shows who they are.
- I'm inspired by artists who use a limited palette, like painter Piet Mondrian, and the White Stripes, two musicians who create an incredible sound. Our food is starting to go back to a 'less is more' style.
- I have two bookcases that used to be filled with cookbooks, but now it's mostly books about politics and government. I might just give this all up and run for office.
- I think the big things for me are trying to keep running and staying active, but not forcing to do one hour or five miles but really going out and doing it until you feel good.
- Any time you can involve fake mustaches, things are just better.
- I'd love to open a restaurant that changes every month. One month it would be a mom and bar spaghetti-and-meatball, Red Sox place, and the next it would be a British pub, and everyone gets in a fight.
- I'm in love with 'pure' flavors, things that are natural and delicious, minimally fussed with, that showcase the season.
- I think that people are getting really excited about different ethnic food, and almost even micro-ethnic food. So it's not just, 'I love Asian,' it's Szechuan or Hunan, this one style from China.
- I've traveled all over. I've been to all 50 states. With my dad in the Navy, I lived in the Philippines from nine to 12, and I had dog, monkey, lizard, everything. Then I was in Hawaii, and I'm spear-fishing, catching octopus with my hands.
- You are defined by your ingredients, by the way you touch them, by the flavors you draw from them.

- Even though I live in and love Chicago, I can't stand deep-dish pizza. I'm a New York-style pizza person.
- Food to me, in one word, is 'creativity' or 'expression.' It's simply, 'This is who I am at this point in time, and this is what I want to cook for you.'

- I'm a traditionalist, so for me, black coffee is cool.
- Gray means being open-minded. I always look at the world that way; I'm able to hear both sides of an argument. I don't listen to opera, but I don't think it's good or bad; it's just its own thing. I can completely appreciate it.
- I can't just sit all day on the couch and expect the weight to come off. My goals are my new focus instead of food.
- I think that for me, growing up, my dad was in the Navy; we went all over the world. I love things the weirder the better. The idea I could eat things like snails or frogs legs or things like that was mind-blowingly cool.
- I tried to start my own religion in high school. I was very eccentric. I've always loved attention.
- Dining should be something that isn't always taken extremely seriously.
