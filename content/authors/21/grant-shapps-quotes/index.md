quotes = ['''We believe that a civilised society can be measured by the way in which it treats its most vulnerable members and that being impatient about poverty is therefore simply the default position for modern progressive Conservatives.''' ,'''The reality is that it would be wiser and even kinder for politicians to be responsible about what they claim the NHS will do, because the pain of having raised expectations for parents who are desperate to start a family, only to see those hopes crushed, is more cruel than having said nothing at all.''' ,'''Incentives and infrastructure should encourage development and that development needs to contain the right types of housing in the right places.''' ,'''If there is a moment when it is possible to intervene in the chaotic life of a homeless person, it is when they turn up as an NHS patient.''' ,'''We must formulate policies to allow everyone to have the same opportunities in life and fix our broken society too.''' ,'''I've always thought that the level of homelessness in society is likely to be a truer measure of how civilised we are then almost any other factor.''' ,'''When eco-towns were first announced we said that we would support environmentally-friendly development where local communities supported the home-building; where infrastructure was in place and where the growth was genuinely green.''' ,'''My wife and I set up the business, we were always very open about it and had a business author's name as many authors do.''' ,'''People pay their licence fee in this country because people believe that we should have public service broadcast programming. Of course, there are lots of different ways you could do that.''' ,'''I don't see any reason why society can't function well when people come together in the common interest under our system. In fact that's what the Big Society is all about!''' ,'''We'll always focus on creating a society where people who work hard and want to get on in life are rewarded.''' ,'''What matters to every family in the country is that the cost of living is controlled.''' ,'''Labour voted to increase welfare spending again and again, without considering the effect that the spending was having, either on the people it was designed to help or those working to support the system.''' ,'''It is ludicrous to suggest that we would ever do things that would end with people living on our streets.''' ,'''Things don't always go according to plan. That's life and that's government.''' ,'''As the people at the sharp end of delivering the government's commitment to tackle climate change we know attaining zero carbon status has always involved a flexible approach.''' ,'''Newspapers in this country are famously independent of politics.''' ,'''No government can maintain the public's confidence if it is outwardly split.''' ,'''There's no reason why the public shouldn't be able to see how billions of pounds are being spent on their behalf.''' ,'''Political shenanigans come and go, yet often what feels like a big deal in Westminster fails to get a mention on the news. As a result, the public wisely let most of the hurly-burly of politics wash over their heads.''' ,'''I want to reignite the idea of community with a positive conservatism in which the word 'development' has a new connotation, kind of like a social revolution.''' ,'''Taxi drivers up and down the country are at the vanguard of the electric vehicle revolution.''' ,'''It's vital that communities actually get something back in return for seeing their area developed.''' ,'''Fighting poverty is nothing new for the Conservative Party, but during the 1980s the emphasis placed on individualism and prosperity was sometimes seen to crowd out social issues like helping the most vulnerable in society.''' ,'''When I was setting up my own business in my early 20s I'd get up early and work every hour I could stay awake.''' ,'''The more the government has centralised, the less houses we have built.''' ,'''There should be a way of saying to people 'thank you very much, it has not worked out but here is a good decent package for you to move on from this role and we will support you to move on into other jobs, so it is not a hire and fire thing'; and those are the sorts of changes that Conservatives would like to see.''' ,'''I think it's absolutely extraordinary that any Conservative MP considered even for one minute installing Jeremy Corbyn in Downing Street.''' ,'''Incredibly, a typical town hall official spends 85% of their time satisfying ministers in Whitehall and a puny 15% of the day for local residents. We believe that this relationship is upside down.''' ,'''Having served in the Forces a positive when it comes to applying for jobs. But we know some former service personnel can find the transition difficult.''' ,'''A tax is something people pay out of income.''' ,'''All too often affordable housing can be a block on mobility and aspiration, so instead Conservatives will ensure that living in social accommodation means that you'll get a 'freedom pass' to get on and do more with your life.''' ,'''I believe that investing in welfare is crucial - but I also believe that it only works if you're getting help to those who need it. If you're doing it with no results, it's disastrous.''' ,'''One of my priorities is getting the trains to run on time, and as a commuter myself I understand all too well the frustration caused by endless delays and cancellations.''' ,'''I've always been tenacious. I don't let go of things until I think it's fixed. On the other hand I'm a fairly jovial, smiley person.''' ,'''The arts and crafts architecture of Letchworth and Welwyn Garden City is now hugely admired. Remember much of it was stimulated through open competition.''' ,'''We want councillors and MPs to be more closely involved in housing issues because this will help to strengthen local democracy and accountability.''' ,'''Broken Britain isn't just about our indebted economy, it's also about our broken society and broken politics too.''' ,'''Every part of society should honour the debt we owe those who've served our country.''' ,'''Look, ideally I'd like to have free money to give to everybody. The reality is in government you have to choose and make decisions.''' ,'''I've always been quite driven so it wasn't like the cancer was my wake-up call.''' ,'''I see the Conservative party becoming more and more attractive to people from all different backgrounds, particularly because so many of the immigrant communities are people who work hard and get on in life... so I think they are naturally Conservative.''' ,'''Our brave servicemen and women sacrifice so much for us all - whether they're spending months away from their families and friends or putting their lives on the line for our country.''' ,'''It's impossible to know precisely what constitutes the right house price but I do know that house prices doubling or even tripling over a 10 year period caused a lot of people to find that getting a foot on the housing ladder is near on impossible.''' ,'''For anyone who has found it easy to conceive, it is perhaps hard to imagine how IVF can become all-encompassing in someone's life. The endless check-ups, scans, tests, periods of waiting and finally the day when you learn the result. It's a physically punishing process for the women and an emotionally exhausting process for both partners.''' ,'''I think he would care if you were a good person, if indeed there is a god.''' ,'''I was so glad when geek went from being a bad word to a good word.''' ,'''To reduce repossessions caused by unemployment, Gordon Brown needs to look at cutting the rate of corporation tax for small companies to 20 per cent and the main rate to 25 per cent, while reducing the rate of employers' national insurance by 1% for the smallest companies.''' ,'''Labour have long since forgotten that people work hard to pay their taxes and support our welfare system.''' ,'''Welfare's just one of the problems Labour failed to tackle when they were in government.''' ,'''Look at the growing middle class in India. Small businesses are not just a source of jobs and prosperity: they are the driving force of social justice too.''' ,'''I believe that overall if you want a growing economy what you have got to have is sufficient flexibility to allow that to happen.''' ,'''Our reasons for criminalising squatting are crystal clear - we want to protect the rights of regular hard-working homeowners against the damage squatters can inflict on their homes, and the distress this causes in their lives.''' ,'''My personal interest in IVF led me to author two reports into the availability of treatment on the NHS.''' ,'''I think politicians just need to get out in the real world.''' ,'''By scrapping the government's centrally dictated density targets we'll ensure that the right type of new homes are built where they're needed, ending the glut of one- and two-bedroom flats.''' ,'''It is often said there is a great deal of talent in the Conservative Parliamentary Party. This is true, but too many of the brightest and best remain on the backbenches.''' ,'''I think it is absolutely inevitable that Palestinians will, and have to, have their own state.''' ,'''None of us want to live in a society where people are forced to sleep in shop doorways, on park benches or in dangerous, run-down buildings.''' ,'''IVF became the only way for us to have children after I was treated for Hodgkin's lymphoma 10 years ago with fertility-destroying chemotherapy. And while the cancer treatment was predictably punishing for me, I was struck by the anguish of the IVF process and in particularly the failed cycle.''' ,'''When Welwyn Garden City was planned, the workers homes were placed in the east, downwind from the factories in the middle, whilst the bosses got the larger westside homes in Handside. This sort of social engineering, including the absence of a pub, would not be acceptable today.''' ,'''I suspect I have a relationship with my religion which will seem slightly weird to people who don't understand me.''' ,'''Conservatives don't love business for some abstract reason. We love it because of what it offers our children. Hope.''' ,'''Chemo is properly punishing, and it's hard to do things at the usual level.''' ,'''I did not have a second job while being an MP.''' ,'''The idea that squatting in some way offers a reasonable solution to the issue of homelessness is both false and cruel.''' ,'''MPs are only elected thanks to the help of ordinary members - activists on the ground who traipse the streets, post leaflets and engage in millions of doorstep conversations, come rain or shine and without pay.''' ,'''Before I went into parliament I used to write business publications, and like many authors wrote under a business name.''' ,'''We need a system where some politicians - who quite rightly respond to the public mood - are prepared to stand up in favour of housebuilding, so I came up with a system that gives local people something they really want in return for building more homes. In our case in Hatfield, it's a new town centre.''' ,'''Gordon Brown doesn't often spring surprises. He's usually far too cautious to deliver the unexpected.''' ,'''Business can be hard. But we need more of it.''' ,'''There is a dangerous chasm between what those seeking election claim they could do in office and the stark reality that once in power the real decision-making has long since been sub-contracted elsewhere.''' ,'''It's almost impossible to get the outside world to take any notice of homelessness at all.''' ,'''Extra homes require additional services and councils have to pick up the tab.''' ,'''Like all parents, I want to give my kids the best start in life.''' ,'''We are the workers' party. We are the party of the hard working individual.''' ,'''I believe that enabling former service personnel to travel more easily is the least we can do.''' ,'''I always think there's some value in saying no with a smile.''' ,'''My great hope for my speck of time on this planet would be that I live and die, and that what I leave behind has made some kind of impression and has been for the better in terms of my family and friends and, in my case, public service.''' ,'''When I was starting a small printing shop in Wembley, I vividly remember coming out of the cinema, realising I had spent the two hours worrying about that month's payroll, rather than focusing on the film.''' ,'''Businesses, not benefits, are the true ladder of social mobility.''' ,'''Most people don't get the chance to do whatever their dream in life was. I have ended up doing exactly what I wanted to do and it has been more enjoyable, challenging, stretching and fulfilling than I would have dared to imagine.''' ,'''Of course homelessness has many causes and the solutions are often frustratingly complex.''' ,'''People like me - who set up a homelessness foundation, worked with all the homeless charities, authored probably six of seven homelessness papers - don't make changes without thinking through the impact of them on the homeless.''' ,'''I like being Jewish and I married a Jewish girl. It's like a way of life and it's good to be able to instil some of that sense of being in your kids. All of that makes me seem as though I am quite observant but actually the flipside of this is I don't know if there is a God or not.''' ,'''I have probably become a lot more Zionist than I used to be. Jews have a history of being persecuted over a long, long period of time so I think it is absolutely right to have a country that is a Jewish state.''' ,'''I have always been an aviation nerd. I read the magazines.''' ,'''Struggling to start a small business is all-encompassing. It is a 24-hour job that places strain on those involved. As well as worrying about your own mortgage and kids, you worry about those of your staff.''' ,'''We need to make sure that people are progressively better off in work than they would be on welfare.''' ,'''I absolutely believe that we're the workers' party. We are the party that has always been at the forefront of the big social changes that have promoted women and working people.''' ,'''I went to Manchester poly for two years.''' ,'''Representing the people of Welwyn Garden City makes me intensely proud.''' ,'''An astonishing disengagement from reality is necessary to actually believe there is something sinister about protecting people's homes from invasion through squatting.''' ,'''We know that solving homelessness has to be about more than simply introducing a new raft of government initiatives, task forces and top-down solutions.''' ,'''Businesses create every penny of the wealth we need to pay for our nation's schools, our NHS and our pensions. They are our only path to prosperity.''' ,'''One of the cruellest things of all is to have a huge deficit in this country, meaning that everyone's children will be expected to pay back for our debt today. That is unfair as well.''' ,'''We may forget it, among the glitz of the Christmas lights, but capitalism can be a profoundly moral force.''' ,'''Throughout the ages it has always been possible to point to good and bad architecture.''' ,'''While we recognise the challenges councils are facing, we do expect to see them match our commitment to the most vulnerable.''' ,'''If you believe in staying at home and looking after your kids, and bringing your kids up, we think it is a fantastic thing to do.''' ,]
