- I had done student films for the School Of Visual Arts and for NYU and all these schools in New York, so those were my first film experiences, but they were student films, so I guess they don't really count.
- Bruce Willis is Bruce Willis in every single movie I've seen him in, except 'Death Becomes Her' and 'Mortal Thoughts,' which is another movie he was in that was very different from what he normally does.
- Madonna's always going to be number one, but I'm definitely a Britney fan.
- I went to school in the Bronx. I learned to constantly try to cover up the fact that I was gay. That facade of being somebody I'm really not just to protect myself definitely helped with acting.
- I'm a loner. I like to be alone. I'm socially awkward.
- I love Rob Zombie - I'd love to work with Rob Zombie or John Cameron Mitchell.
- I did a show back when I was in high school - so I was about 17 - and it was the first time I was on stage. I never even thought about being an actor before that, but after that experience, I knew it was what I wanted to do.
- It's important to work really hard to get what you want.
- I connect to humor really deeply, so I feel really comfortable just being in funny projects.
- I love 'The Walking Dead.'
- I got to a point where I was completely typecast, and I knew I was paying my dues, and I was happy to do so because I knew that's what had to happen, and I loved acting. But I would never go back.
- I'm just a big old nerd. I'm not that cool guy at all.
- I was named Class Clown in the high school yearbook, so I was always turning to comedy and laughter to heal and to get me through things.
- I learned to really pursue things I really wanted. If it is just for the money, that's not going to work out. You have to like it.
- I have phone sessions with my therapist, who is in New York, constantly, just to talk and get it out.
- I'm obsessed with 'Girls.'
- It was great working with Kevin Smith - just a dream.
- I'm a huge horror film and sci-fi fan.
- I would totally do a Madonna or Lady Gaga video.
- When I was growing up, we didn't have 'Will & Grace.' The one gay character was Monroe from 'Too Close For Comfort' - and he wasn't even gay! At least they didn't say he was. Same with Mr. Furley from 'Three's Company.' You know, these were the characters that people would always make fun of.
- I'm really into horror art, so I feel, like, a dark side in that way.
- I remember my parents taking me to see 'The Exorcist' in theaters when I was really young. They're Cuban and didn't really speak English, so I don't think they got that it was a movie about a girl possessed by the devil.
- It's always nice to do the flashbacks. That's what's so great about 'Scandal' is that we get to do flashbacks and then keep figuring out and discovering more things about our characters that make them fuller.
- I would love to do more horror films.
- I want to be the bad guy.
- It's TV: you just have to jump in and just do it. You don't have time to think about it. You don't have time to write a history, which makes it even better. I go with first instincts.
- When the attention is on me, off-camera, I get uncomfortable - sort of shy and at a loss for words, as you can probably tell?
- It's weird: when I first got on Twitter, I had a couple hundred, then thousand, followers. Now I have over 53,000.
- 'Fresh' was maybe the third audition that I had after I got an agent, so I was crazy excited when I booked it.
- I'm drawn to the not-so-perfect character.
- When I was in high school, I wasn't really popular. I was picked on a lot. And then I did a talent show, and kids started to tell me that I did a good job. It was the first time that my peers told me that they liked what I was doing. Something clicked, and I knew that this is what I wanted to do.
- I'm Cuban. My parents are immigrants.
- I hit Instagram and Twitter as soon as I wake up. And then I check my texts and emails. It's funny that I check social media before I check my email.
- I get off on pushing people's buttons sometimes.
