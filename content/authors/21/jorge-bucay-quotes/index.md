quotes = ['''When you don't manage your life well, you become angry and frustrated as things don't go as intended, and our bad mood is a sign showing we were not able to resolve the conflict.''' ,'''If someone has children, the first thing they want is for them to be happy, and then become someone in life and all that. But the educational system, I mean always, not just now, creates competitive, successful people, and does not educate them to be happy. The problem is that success gives money, not happiness. The eternal problem.''' ,]
