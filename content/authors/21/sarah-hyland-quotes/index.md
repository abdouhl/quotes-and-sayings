- I'm a sarcastic person, and people don't get my humor sometimes.
- I love living in L.A. It's quieter. It's much more relaxing. I'm living in a house for the first time ever. I have a backyard for the first time ever; a dog for the first time ever. So it's a lot of firsts, and I love it so much. It's just so different. It's a nice change of pace.
- You know that family is going to be there for you no matter what. My dad gave me a freakin' kidney!
- I would say at times I am a 'Glamoholic.' But I am definitely more laid back than glamorous. I think it takes a lot of effort and sometimes I just want to be in jeans.
- 'Modern Family' has definitely opened up a lot of doors and I will always be grateful.
- I think success right now is not about how famous you are or how much you're getting paid, but it's more about if you're steadily working and you're happy with what you're doing.
- You're in everyone's homes every week as this character, and they feel like they know you, and then they start to really define you as this character that you portray.
- I gave myself two months to book a job. One month later I was cast on 'Modern Family.'
- You know that family is going to be there for you no matter what. My dad gave me a freakin' kidney! But it's also the families that you create outside of your family.
- What I decide to wear literally depends on how I'm feeling that day.
- I love Neutrogena's Makeup Remover Cleansing Wipes. They get all my makeup off and are really moisturizing.
- Friends are hard to come by in L.A., especially in the entertainment industry. I've known a lot of people who hang out with someone because they're working on a show, and as soon as that show gets canceled, they find someone new.
- A lot of people don't know I can sing because I don't, like, post it everywhere.
- Lately, I've been playing very fashion-forward, popular girls, which is great because it's led me to things like this Nintendo 3DS 'Style Savvy' campaign. It'd be fun to do something a bit dorkier - or quirkier!
- I've always been a fan of Nintendo. My first memories of playing games are on my Nintendo 64 with 'Mario Kart,' so when I found out that Nintendo 3DS made a fashion game, I was drawn to it. 'Style Savvy Trendsetters' is great because anyone can play it.
- I just filmed a movie with my boyfriend, an indie film called 'Conception.' And it's kind of like an R-rated version of 'Valentine's Day.' So it's like all about eight couples, and me and my boyfriend play one of them together. And that was a lot of fun.
- I always went to school, and when I was working, I had tutoring every day. I still had a childhood.
- Twitter is awesome to share news with fans, but I would never choose to only have social media and put everything in my life on display.
- I have really big alien eyes, so the more mascara the better.
- I'm more of a homebody type. I don't want to look like I want to be in the public eye. I didn't become an actress to be famous.
- My eyes are so big that, weirdly, I feel like an alien if my eyelashes don't match their intensity. I like to curl my lashes to the point where they're sticking straight up and then put on a ton of mascara!
- I just love the color purple on me, because it goes really well with my eye color.
- I wish I was taller or curvier, but I'm happy with the way I look.
- When I was a child, I was unable to go to any type of sleepaway summer camp because of health issues. Once I learned about the Lopez Foundation, I knew I wanted to get involved, send kids with kidney disease away to camp so they can still experience overnight camp with medical needs at hand.
- I'm very competitive. When I was, like, four, I would see a Shake 'N Bake commercial and see a little girl on that and think, 'I can do that. I might be better.'
- I grew up in the East Village with a lot of old people in my building, and I'm not sure if they lost their sense of smell over the years, but they always seemed to smell like they poured a bottle of perfume on themselves. I never want to become that person.
- I never went to college, so I've never actually met a frat guy.
- I'm friends with Taylor Swift, and I am tired of people asking me questions about our friendship. When I post a picture of us on Instagram, I'm posting a picture of me and my friend.
