- The reason why I have lost weight is that I looked at the international schedule and thought that I wanted to play for another two years. It is a very hectic schedule and if I want to get through that then I have to be in the best shape that I can.
- People make mistakes and I've probably made a few more than others, but unfortunately mine are also a bit more public. That's the way it is. You've just got to get on with life. After all, it's not a rehearsal.
- I've slept with a couple of people and made some poor choices and put things in jeopardy with... what I was happy with, and that's my own fault. I've got no one else to blame about that stuff.
- The first thing is to be patient, which is probably the hardest thing to do. Don't worry if blokes are whacking you out of the park because you still have the opportunity to get him out next ball, even if it's not the same ball.
- I suppose my look, the way I play - you combine all that sort of stuff and that makes people interested in what I actually do. So then, when off-the-field stuff happens... I suppose it's one of those cocktail mixes.
- Four hundred wickets is 400 more than I thought I'd get.
- If you ask anyone around the cricket grounds, they will say I always sign loads of autographs and thank the ladies for lunch and try to behave in the right way.
- I can 100 percent tell you that I have not gone under the surgeon's knife or had a facelift.
- The IPL is just pure, intense. You don't need all the other stuff. I don't believe in coaches in international cricket.
- I'm fitter than I've ever been, I'm actually very, very healthy and I'm happy.
- I have a responsibility to my children to be fit and healthy.
- We played well in Kenya. We didn't lose a game and we bowled Pakistan out for 100 twice. We don't need to change much from that for this tournament.
- I also think there's too many players who say the same boring answers, they don't even have to turn up to interviews because journalists answer their own questions the way they ask them. Unfortunately the way it is now players are so afraid to say anything, but I'd like them to be honest.
- To me, cricket is a simple game. Keep it simple and just go out and play.
- I am no dummy, mate, that's for sure.
- We've just got to be careful - with all sports, let alone cricket - I think there's so much emphasis on doing the right thing all the time, but I think the public want to be entertained when they come to watch sport.
- I think we have got the wood on South Africa, but that does not mean they are not a good team. They intimidate a lot of teams but we intimidate them. There is no disrespect for South Africa; they are a very good team.
- You can't afford to live your life with regrets.
- All my coaches tell me that I have been under achieving.
- My life was falling apart and then to come out and play and have my best ever - 40 wickets, 250 runs... But the only reason I could do that was because of the way I thought and I think I'm pretty strong mentally. I think I am anyway, pretty strong to get over whatever it is.
- My only problem is the fear that opposition bowlers might go for my fingers and that's why I was scared of the short ball. Now I am struggling with the ball pitching up and swinging away. I just keep nicking that one.
- I'm proud of what I've achieved in cricket, as once I didn't think I was good enough.
- With Australians we're saying we're going to win before we start playing and pretty much keep on saying that.
- It was bloody difficult getting followed around all the time.
- The public want to see people play an exciting brand of cricket.
- There are a lot more tabloids in England that like to report other things in your life, some of which are true and some of which are exaggerated and untrue. There have been stories where people claim to have seen me in one place and I wasn't even in that city then. The Aussie press is more judgmental and moralistic.
- I still eat pizzas, I still like pies, I still have spaghetti hoops for breakfast... but it's in moderation now.
- I think when two people get together, their past is their past. Their reputations are reputations. You can only take someone the way you find them... on face value. I think that was how we were both, the way we were.
- I have always tried to move on from disappointments as fast as I can.
- The wickets I have played on for my whole career, most of them have been to suit fast bowlers in Australia.
- I have been trying to lose weight for the last two-three months and it has gone really well. In the last 6-12 months I have been in the best form in quite a while.
- The problem is there's still a big kid inside me who likes to have fun. I am passionate about my cricket and I love my family, but I'm also a kid and maybe I need to grow up... And maybe I don't.
- Being in love with somebody is a wonderful feeling.
- With just about every player in Australia, his whole goal and ambition is to play for Australia. That's why they're playing first class cricket. It's just a different attitude.
- I just play because I love playing and I try and take as many wickets as I can.
- I think when two people get together, their past is their past. Their reputations are reputations. You can only take someone the way you find them... on face value.
