- I've always loved film, and since I knew I probably couldn't be a cowboy or a spy in real life, I thought I'd play one in a movie! I started doing theater in middle school and tested for 'Victorious' before being in an episode of 'iCarly.'
- Disney has been such a big part of my early career. I've done two pilots for Disney, and I've been working with them since I was 16, and I just turned 21.
- When I was younger, I always was like, 'I want to be a serious actor.' I wasn't interested in doing a Disney show or a Nick show. But here I am, and it's great.
- There are a lot of girls I've found attractive, but we could never date. If a girl can make me laugh, that's really attractive to me. I have a soft spot for southern girls who are sweet, like Taylor Swift!
- I can be a goofball sometimes. I love having a good time and being carefree.
- I love to read. I was in AP English in high school, and we were assigned books every few months. 'Moby Dick' and 'The Great Gatsby' are two of my favorite ones.
- I love film; I'd love to do as many films as possible.
- When I did '21 Jump Street,' I felt like I was a part of something great, but on a very large scale. Working with people that genuinely want to make good art or good work or a good film, that's what keeps me going.
- I was trained as a dramatic actor. I'm really excited to do some more dramatic stuff.
- When I was ten, I loved movies like 'Cool Hand Luke' and 'Roman Holiday.' When I watched those things, I felt like it was such a good escape. It wasn't even that I needed an escape, but I wanted to be an actor so I could give that feeling to someone else.
- Disney acting is a little more difficult than many people think it is. People feel like the characters aren't deep, but as an actor, you try to do everything you can do the best of your ability.
- I've actually done three pilots for Disney. I met with the network when I was 16 years old and had just started acting. I would fly to Los Angeles to film pilots, then fly back to Dallas, where I grew up.
- I like doing something romantic with a girl on Valentine's Day, like making her dinner and keeping it simple. The more quality time, the better.
- Everyone has those times when you feel like you don't fit in. Everyone struggles to a certain extent with being cool and popular, but I never really let it affect me. I played sports and did theater, and school was really important to me. I had fun in high school.
- I love everything from country to alternative to Blink-182 and '90s music to Dave Matthews.
