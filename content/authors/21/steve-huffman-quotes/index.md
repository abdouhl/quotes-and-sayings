- I use the traditional phone noise that's built into iOS. I like an actual ringing sound.
- I use the default iOS calendar app. I've tried others, but it's my favorite, and I can't live without it. If it's not on my calendar, I'm not aware of it, whatever it is.
- The day I woke up and Reddit was working on its own was just the most incredible feeling.
- I'm rarely in a position where I can actually answer my phone without being rude to someone else. Sometimes I look back and realize it's been weeks since I've actually been alone. With texting, I can at least get a sense of what's going on without interrupting what I'm doing.
- I could go on a long rant about how much I despise e-mail. I wish it was more socially acceptable to ignore people.
