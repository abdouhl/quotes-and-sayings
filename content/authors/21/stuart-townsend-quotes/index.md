- With directing, you always have three or four things constantly on the go. It's a tough industry and a tough time, particularly if you're doing things a little outside the box or independent features.
- Actors want to be told what to do - they really do. But they also want to have an input and be recognized for that.
- I'd worked with directors who wouldn't collaborate. Then I've also worked with directors who didn't really know what they wanted. I knew I didn't want to be either one of those guys - or girls.
- I was really educating myself on the environment, but I didn't realize it was so connected to politics, connected to globalization.
- In real life I can play guitar, sure, but badly.
- Home is a relative concept for me. I've been in Los Angeles 10 years, and I definitely feel at home here, but I also feel at home in a lot of places. I'm not too attached to anywhere, really. Home is where the people you love are at the time.
- I do love comedy, I have to say. That's one of the greatest things about being an actor: You get to try new things and play around in different genres.
- Acting is great. You spend your whole life trying to get it right.
- I don't really go around feeling very Irish at all. I don't go to Irish pubs. I've lived so many places, and I'm still so curious about the bigger world. It's grand to be alive in a time when mobility is so accessible.
