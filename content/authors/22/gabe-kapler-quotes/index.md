It's the sum of his parts that makes the Los Angeles Dodgers ace baseball's most successful pitcher.''' ,'''I am immensely proud of our people. The way we have been persecuted, and our drive and our survival, is mind-boggling. I think that is part of the reason I continue to be so connected to the Holocaust, and why that has such a moving effect on me.''' ,'''Chad Curtis told me I was going to hell if I didn't believe that Jesus Christ was my lord and savior.''' ,'''I won't step foot inside a new eatery without some strong recommendations or after consulting a site like Yelp or Urban Spoon.''' ,'''On MLB team flights, adult beverages are often enjoyed.

Pitch selection must be on point. Defensive genius must occur. And everyone must adhere to the time tested baseball tradition of superstition.''' ,'''A pitcher's windup and throw is an explosive, coordinated full-body movement. They perform the move once, then rest, then perform it again. There is nothing aerobic about it.''' ,'''I've always made the case that a baseball locker room is simply an extension of society. Every type of person you have in your large office environment is also represented in an MLB clubhouse.''' ,'''Hip flexibility is genetic to a degree, and the most gifted hitters have won both the genetic and mechanical lottery.''' ,'''I loved having a fan appreciate my style of play, but nothing in the world is more gratifying than having 24 guys gaze at you adoringly for quite assertively scoring a run at the expense of a member of the other team.''' ,'''For MLB players, sitting around aimlessly waiting to heal is never a good idea.''' ,'''As a base runner myself, the moment I reached second base I began to fantasize about the potential contact at the plate. Every time I met a catcher in front of the plate throughout my career, the response I received from my teammates when returning to the dugout was a true hero's welcome.''' ,'''The stress of not allowing yourself life's guilty pleasures from time to time is as unhealthy as the act of indulging.''' ,'''Lower stress equals a calmer approach at the plate. Calm equals a still head, allowing us to see the ball better. Confidence and relaxation; the hitter's Holy Grail.''' ,'''Green base ballers don't want to be viewed as unhealthy. Young players are constantly judged and evaluated on every layer of their being.''' ,'''You can grow old without growing up.''' ,'''When a ball is struck with more velocity and at the right angle to create the most distance, you end up with a bomb.''' ,'''If Coors Field is the flashy youngster, Wrigley is a wise and weathered, tattered, beat up old man, but rich in charisma and character.''' ,'''So for me, my vice and big challenge is coffee intake. I drink black, organic coffee, but I drink way too much.''' ,'''Despite my strict, healthy diet when mired within my regular routine, when I venture in a explorative fashion for a meal, it's all out, no-holds barred, dessert, and drinks, the whole nine.''' ,'''I never experienced the joy of being on the good guy's side of the perfect game or no-hitter. Karma.''' ,'''Teammates in all sports love to be acknowledged.''' ,'''Narcissism is a trait universally unappreciated by human beings, and NFL players fall into this human bucket.''' ,'''I had my share of failures at the plate as a MLB player, but I was always pretty confident against left-handed pitching.''' ,'''When do you get into your best conversations? Probably when you're relaxed.''' ,'''I'd had a concept that I strongly believe in, which is that when people are comfortable and they're confident, they are also better at life and better at their job.''' ,'''Throwing on a hoodie and headphones and getting lost in a long run is pure freedom for me. I embrace the trance, the intense sweat and, of course, the endorphin release.''' ,'''Confidence, it turns out, is as vital to a players success as is talent.''' ,'''I can remember being in right field in Yankee Stadium and fans armed with media guides called out my family by their names and said absolutely unrepeatable things.

That doesn't leave a whole lot of time to train, and it certainly doesn't leave a lot of time for a social life. Which I have none.''' ,'''In 2005, when I felt my Achilles snap, I knew instantly that it wasn't just my anatomy that had changed, but my life as well.''' ,'''After an injury left me unable to perform my usual routine, I focused on the best upper body workouts to keep myself fit and strong.''' ,'''I'm just a person that is trying his best along the way.''' ,'''This is why sports will always be the greatest of dramas; the most exciting entertainment known to man.

In the most trivial way, this makes sense. This measurement, however, doesn't tell us much about baseball speed.''' ,'''Part of the beauty of playing with seven teams across MLB is that I got to know hundreds of men intimately.''' ,'''As an average hitter myself, I lacked that true back knee drive.''' ,'''There is nowhere on Earth like Boston for a player.''' ,'''Game 7 of a Championship Series sucks the emotion out of a player, particularly if you have to stroll home a loser when it's over.''' ,'''Pete Rose inspired my style of play, but should not be in the Hall of Fame.''' ,'''If you've been apartment or home shopping and left disgusted because a realtor brought you into a space that hadn't been updated since 1977, you've experienced the visitors clubhouse at Wrigley.

They're laser focused on the flight of the ball, its trajectory and the speed with which it leaves the bat.''' ,'''In 2006, I woke up every morning and dreaded the ballpark. I knew how difficult it was to even prepare my body to go out and play.''' ,'''Brimming with fortitude, Wrigley wears its ability to brave the elements like a badge of honor. More so than any other ballpark in America, it has witnessed blizzards and subzero temperatures. More importantly, it stands as testament to decades of suffering fans, their pain littered throughout the seats and corridors.''' ,'''Tall pitchers create leverage and angle, often inducing more groundballs and sometimes swings and misses.''' ,'''I've been privy to many athletic environments, both amateur and professional.''' ,'''If I'm going to hand over my classic Italian sports car, and you're going to be driving it down Pacific Coast Highway with the top down, while I watch, I want to be certain that I'm adequately compensated for the pain of that vision.''' ,'''If you ask me what my hobby is, I don't have a traditional hobby.''' ,'''Culturally Jewish, I was - and am - proud of my heritage, but don't practice religion.''' ,'''I believe in my heart that the name of the game in baseball - from an offensive perspective - is getting on base and not making outs.''' ,'''I'm not a golfer. I don't fish. I don't even watch TV.''' ,'''When I was 8 years old, I was struck by a car and broke a few ribs.''' ,'''Not only do squats build muscle in the quadriceps, hamstrings and calves, they also allow for the release of testosterone and growth hormone providing a highly anabolic environment for all other areas to grow when trained.''' ,'''Elite baseball mechanics feel different in the bodies of MLB players than they appear on film.''' ,'''Wrigley, beyond its status as a baseball icon, has an undeniable positive energy all its own, which penetrates all who enter its gates.''' ,'''When an injury robs a player of his ability to train the way he's accustomed to, there is nearly always an alternative.''' ,'''No sir, I don't have a crystal ball, but I do have common sense.''' ,'''Sports psychology suggests - and we as players have been taught - that negative self-talk can diminish our chances for success and that the opposite is also true. Given the talent, we can also think and speak our way to success.''' ,'''The squat is ideal for building strength in the glutes, perhaps the most powerful collection of muscles in our bodies.''' ,'''Independent of the strength implications, baseball, like most athletic events, is a game of feeling capable of handling the current challenge.''' ,'''Attempting to predict shoulder and elbow issues due to extensive innings early in a pitchers career is an inexact science.''' ,'''My dad ran a few marathons; I fight the urge to do the same because I know that it's not the most efficient way to train unless you're preparing for an event similar in nature, which baseball players are not.''' ,'''Short pitchers often have compact, repeatable mechanics that can lead to good control and command.''' ,'''David Price gives the best high-fives in all of baseball.

It's a survival of the fittest thing.''' ,'''I was stronger than Robinson Cano is, but he consistently strikes the baseball with substantially more force than I did.''' ,'''Letting the ball travel is an important mental cue.
