The people I've known, the changes of season, the call of the blue jay - when I'm away, all of them haunt me.''' ,'''The 'M*A*S*H' cast loves each other with unconditional love; our domestic animals love us with unconditional love.''' ,'''The richest people are those who have life arranged so they have food for the family and the rent or mortgage paid.
