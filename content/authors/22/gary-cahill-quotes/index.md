But if it gets to eight or nine games, then you have to explain the situation. What's going on?''' ,'''Leaving Chelsea was sad, but naturally everything has to come to an end.''' ,'''Not every single minute of your career will go well, individually and collectively, and not every season will go how you want it to, but it's how you react to that.''' ,'''That's the buzz you want as a footballer - to perform well in the big high-profile games.''' ,'''It is difficult to click your fingers and say, 'Right, go and play that formation now.'''' ,'''I was told 'you can't play for England, you're at Bolton.'

It's difficult to do that.''' ,'''I don't want to be stale.''' ,'''Sometimes when you're at a club like Chelsea you feel sorry when you see a player move on, because naturally some progress and some don't. You don't hear about the ones that don't.''' ,'''Players at the highest level have got high football intelligence, so they can adapt, but at the same time you need a structure and an idea of how you've got to play that system.''' ,'''You want to achieve the most you can in the short period you have in your career as a professional footballer.''' ,'''You can go anywhere in the Premier League and it's going to be tough. Every single game is so tough. So I think if you make it, and you're lucky enough to play in the Premier League, I don't think there's a need to go anywhere.''' ,'''For me, it's about consistently churning out performances and looking to improve at the same time.''' ,]
