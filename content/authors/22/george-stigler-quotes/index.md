I spent the next year at Northwestern University.''' ,'''That subject has lost its one time appeal to economists as our science has become more abstract, but my interest has even grown more intense as the questions raised by the sociology of science became more prominent.''' ,'''After the war, I returned to Minnesota, from which I soon moved to Brown University, and a year later, to Columbia University where I remained from 1947 until 1958.''' ,'''I met my wife, Margaret L. Mack, at the University of Chicago. We were married in 1936. She died in 1970.''' ,]
