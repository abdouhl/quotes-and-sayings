Fiction is a wonderful way of exploring that.''' ,'''Non-fiction books have helped me enormously with lots of my books.''' ,'''The older I get, the more my curiosity grows, and every book I write is a new exploration.''' ,'''Refugees come from many different backgrounds and live in many different circumstances, so I wouldn't like to generalise. But I think refugees from the U.K. would probably be healthier and better fed than those from many other countries.''' ,'''I'm incurably nosey - so naturally I'm a great reader.''' ,'''If fiction changes things, it's usually because it's a powerful way of exploring social issues. And it helps us to understand people who are different from us.''' ,'''Fiction is often most powerful when the author is exploring an issue - and not writing like a know-it-all who has the perfect answer.''' ,]
