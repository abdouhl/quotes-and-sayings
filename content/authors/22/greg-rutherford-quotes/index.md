quotes = ['''For a long time, I thought I'd be a physio if I wasn't a sportsman. At one point, I wanted to be an inventor, and I'd come up with little schemes.''' ,'''I do a lot of things like running hills and larger amounts of reps in the gym.''' ,'''Although 8.25 isn't very big, it's good to be the best of Europe again.''' ,'''Athletics set the right sentiment for a clean and believable sport.''' ,'''There's definitely football in the blood, but my body made my decision for me that I was going to be an Olympic athlete instead.''' ,'''The type of IBS I am prone to is the constipation type, where I get trapped wind and can get sharp painful spasms in my intestines as well as having sluggish bowels.''' ,'''My favourite series of all time has been 'Band of Brothers.' That was amazing; I've watched that so many times.''' ,'''I've got two chocolate labradors, Murphy and Dexter. They're like my children.''' ,'''There are not many people around the world who can say, 'I get paid to jump into a sandpit.'''' ,'''Adrenaline is an incredible thing.''' ,'''I think it was just me who thought I could be Olympic champion.

My parents were fantastic at taking me to training sessions and letting me try lots of different sports, so I want to do the same.''' ,'''If the room falls silent for a moment, all I hear is white noise.''' ,'''I do weights three or four times a week, and it has had an incredible impact on my confidence.''' ,'''The DNA showed I have a level of endurance in me which I never really realised, which makes sense.''' ,'''I come into these competitions to win, not to get silver or bronze, so it is frustrating.''' ,'''My parents were great at making sure I got out of bed when I needed to play football on a Sunday morning and that I was ready after school to go to training on a Tuesday and Thursday. But it was never forced upon me or rammed down my throat. If it had been, I could have ended up hating sport.''' ,'''I knew I was going to be a sportsman.''' ,'''Ultimately the clothing company is a large investment on my part, and I'm taking a huge gamble. But having a focus away from the track is good for you.''' ,'''If other people have problems with my competitions, then there's nothing I can do.''' ,'''I haven't actually checked my family tree, but Rutherford is a very old Scottish name, so I've probably got Scottish genes a few generations back.''' ,'''Since the Olympics in London, people say, 'Greg's won again.

I'm also into ice hockey.''' ,'''I don't think there are many long jumpers who can say they have jumped so hard that have lost their hearing.''' ,'''Jumping isn't as important to my training as you might think; I'm only in the sandpit once a week. There's a high risk factor of injury doing it, so instead, I rely on my progress in the gym to judge how far I'll jump on the big day.''' ,'''Hopefully, I can get multiple distances out there and re-establish myself as one of the best jumpers in the world.''' ,'''Me and my brother just used to fight all the time; then my sister came along, and it was all about the little girl in the house.

That's what I've always wanted, that level of recognition.''' ,'''As a jumper, I try to defy gravity as long as I can. But no matter how far I jump, I'll always hit the earth eventually.''' ,'''It was when my American coach Dan Pfaff came over from the States in 2009 and started working with me that we really began to look at my diet. He decided I was eating too many carbohydrates, so I cut back on bread. Over the next year I lost weight and became leaner.''' ,'''I think the first time baby recognises me and smiles is going to be one of the most amazing times of my life, to be honest.''' ,'''To put up with me, you have to be patient.''' ,'''Being in a scenario where you're thinking, 'I can't do what I want to do due to the financial burden that comes with some of it,' makes you think, 'Well, I could go and do an after-dinner speech every night.' I'd probably earn more than I could in track-and-field. But that's a dangerous scenario to get yourself into.''' ,'''Over the years, I've had torrid luck with things going wrong.''' ,'''Fruit is carb-based, and I limit carbs when training hard.''' ,'''I'm excited by going 85 mph, head-first, down an ice track.''' ,'''If you put me against most sprinters in the world, I reckon over a start I could get very close, if not take them.''' ,'''I was quite lucky: although my dad worked a lot, whenever he was free, he would play sports with me and my brother, and I can't wait to do that with my child.''' ,'''I take magnesium to prevent cramps. A few years back, I suffered from hamstring tears, and part of that can be to do with muscle cramping, and then pushing the muscle at that point. I also take a fish oil supplement.''' ,'''I've had 30 hamstring tears.''' ,'''I wasn't jumping like Carl Lewis, but I still won an Olympic title.''' ,'''Lolo Jones came up to me and said, 'Well done, Greg,' and I don't think I've ever spoken to her in my life.''' ,'''I'm a very keen baker; I pride myself on my cakes.

But I always had belief.''' ,'''Ultimately, I'm enjoying what I'm doing.''' ,'''My dad is a builder, and my mum's a nurse. They're just very normal people.''' ,'''I am pleased I went from fourth back into a medal position, but bronze is not good enough for me.''' ,'''I eat a lot of vegetables and salad. I put strawberries, pomegranate seeds, blackberries, and blueberries into shakes and add Greek yoghurt for a snack. I have this when I'm not training.''' ,'''If I win the Olympics in Rio, then I'll have each title in double.''' ,'''When at home in Buckinghamshire, I tend to work out for two to three hours on the track or in the woods close by and then do weights.''' ,'''Even though arguably I could have done much better at school, I'd decided at a young age that I was going to be a professional sportsman at some sport. And at that stage, there was a bit of luck: I was fortunate to meet the right people at the right time to get me to where I am now.''' ,'''I thought I was going to jump further than that, but I don't care - I'm Olympic champion.''' ,'''My grandfather died before I was born, so I never had the chance to speak with him about his father. But I learned about him from books.''' ,'''I've not received any major sponsorship deals or anything else.''' ,'''I want to become double Olympic champion, triple Olympic champion, five-time world medallist.''' ,'''I'm very driven, and there are lots of things I can't do.''' ,'''It's all about proving it on the track and proving to people that have different views wrong.''' ,'''People assume that you need to run fast to get to optimum fitness, but the truth is endurance lifting makes you stronger and leaner.''' ,'''People forget that track and field is one of the hardest sports because we compete against all the world. There are many sports when you are up against only 15 or 20 countries.''' ,'''I dabbled in football myself until the age of 14, but I didn't have as much love for the sport as I did track and field. I would never have been good enough to take it to the highest level.''' ,'''I seem to be the 'luckiest' athlete around - and that's one of the most frustrating things. You compete against a vast array of people and train your whole life for those moments.''' ,'''I always start the day with a protein shake: protein powder mixed with water, peanut butter, and yoghurt to thicken it up.''' ,'''I have been in discussions with the BBC regarding my involvement with SPOTY after hearing what I believe to be very outdated and derogatory comments from a fellow SPOTY nominee.''' ,'''I would love to be an historian. I'm a bit of a history geek and love books and programmes on the subject.''' ,'''I was always the slightly fat kid, which used to bother me quite a bit.''' ,'''It would be pretty special if I could win two Olympic gold medals, one at the Summer Games and one from the Winters, so I'm going to give it a real go.''' ,'''It's quite funny because I always talk to baby through Susie's belly, and every time I start speaking, I just get kicked in the face.''' ,'''I'm never happy to settle.''' ,'''I was persuaded to see 'The Muppets' by a friend, and I regretted it. A very boring hour and a half.''' ,'''I take my three dogs for long walks every day, and I use that time to talk myself through winning every major competition.''' ,]
