quotes = ['''I feel like I was always singing. Since I could speak, I could sing. It came very naturally. In school, I was always singing in choruses and choirs. I always loved to sing; it was something to fun to do.''' ,'''For me, the best way to be as an artist is to be completely yourself, letting that vulnerability come through.''' ,'''As an artist, what you do represents who you are. Coming from a genuine, honest place - that's what I'm trying to do.''' ,'''The meditative, calm sound is a reflection of my personality. I've got a silly and a crazy side, but it makes sense the music would come across that way. I do yoga every day and try to keep a sense of peace and calm in my life. I don't have a lot of frantic energy.''' ,'''I don't sing very loud, which some people have given me trouble about, but we all have to figure out what our voices are, embrace that.''' ,'''You want to have a feeling when you sing that you just love singing; you love the feeling of singing, and you love this feeling of this voice coming out of your body into this world. It's about really getting that most beautiful, pure, centered tone, thinking about the story of each song and the lyrics, and connecting your own life to that story.''' ,'''I might sound like the weird artist hippy girl or whatever, but I don't have a complaint about what jazz is or what I'm doing with music. And that's more of a philosophy on my life. I could find things that maybe could shift or change, but ultimately, it's like that's not a good way to live our lives and think about what we do.''' ,'''You always have to be ready. When I'm washing dishes, I have to have a towel ready so I can dry my hands and push the record button on my phone.''' ,'''It's like, whenever I do any kind of cover, if it's a jazz piece or pop cover, I want to honor the original and make sure that the bulk and the juice of what makes that so great is there, but take it to a different place.''' ,'''I always used to say I'm definitely not a straight-ahead jazz singer, because then there's people who would hear what I do and say, 'Is it jazz? I don't know...' Whatever it is, it really comes down to creating music that makes people feel something.''' ,'''Having artist parents, they knew the importance of exposing me and my sister to all types of music and art and making art part of our every day. it was just always there.''' ,'''It's really fun to get into that process of creating an album and telling a story. I really love it.''' ,'''It's fun to use all of my range; there are so many different colors and textures that come out, revealing different parts of my voice. I know what my voice is capable of, and I try to fit it to each song, evoke a mood.''' ,'''I've always surrounded myself with other artists. My close friends, people I've been in relationships with - I went to an arts high school - even my elementary school was arts based.''' ,'''If I could sing like a Chaka Khan, an Aretha, a Kim Burrell, if I could do all these amazing runs and belt it out, I would. I've attempted that, and it's not something anyone would want to hear.''' ,'''Ultimately, I think there's this umbrella term of jazz, and what's cool about not just what's happening with my music but this general sense of what's happening with this generation of musicians, is it's a very broad term, and we can incorporate all types of music, and we can be influenced and inspired by all kinds of sounds.''' ,]
