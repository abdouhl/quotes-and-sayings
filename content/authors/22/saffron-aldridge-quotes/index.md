- At 24, I took time off to have a baby, and ever since, I have been juggling modelling with motherhood.
- I've never drunk coffee. I'm convinced it has something to do with why my skin is good. I have either mint, green or black tea.
- Basically, my parents messed up because it was the Sixties, and they both had affairs, but they had a great love for each other. I saw that when my father flew over from Los Angeles when he knew my mother was going to die.
- I love going to the cinema, listening to music, yoga and long walks along Holkham beach in Norfolk.
- In the morning, I use a Philosophy cleanser and Olay Regenerist Daily 3 Point Treatment Cream, which sinks in well and feels firming. I rarely wear foundation, so cotton wool soaked in warm water is often enough to cleanse at night, but I take off eye make-up with Klorane's cornflower-infused remover.
- I was working in Camden Lock market from the age of 13 to 16, and people often suggested that I should be a model. I knew a girl working on a stall who was with Take Two model agency, so I decided to go along, and they took me on.
- I don't have a huge breakfast, and I sometimes forget to have lunch, so I focus on dinner. I love Thai and Japanese food.
- My view is that life is too short. I'm not being melodramatic or anything, but when your mother dies in your arms - just you and her, and it's one o'clock in the morning, and you're waiting for her to exhale - you just think, life's too bloody short to argue about the little things.
- I live to eat - when someone else cooks for me.
- I like smudgy black eyes and pale lips for evening. Red lipstick looks great on other girls, but it's too much on me.
