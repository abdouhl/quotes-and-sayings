- Everything is real. It is one of our golden rules for the show. We won't do it otherwise because the show is built around real reaction, ours included.
- The people I respect the most are my peers, my fellow comedians. I want their respect. It's my whole life.
- Usually people are pretty cool when they find out it's a TV show.
- We let the show breathe more. We focused on the comedy from a broadcast point. It became more stylized and interactive.
- In comedy you have to be prepared and be specific and have a vision so your comedy feels organic and relatable and it's a lot of work to get to that point.
- We saw someone dressed as Batman, in a white Batman outfit... it was Jaden Smith.
- We're not trying to make a reality show at all. The show gets described sometimes as a reality show, sometimes as a prank show. I think it's neither. It's just about us, and it's just about us having a platform to be funny and do comedy, really.
- Putting any situation through our comedy lens always goes on in our heads.
- There was an improv class in our high school, and we all ended up taking it and loving it. Then we just started our own thing.
- We're like a middle-aged boy band on tour.
- The show is just basically a mirror of our lives, and the goal was to stay true to that.
- I had a tattoo of Jaden Smith. A very accurate portrait of a 15-year-old Jaden Smith.
- We don't really consider it a prank show because we're not pranking other people - we're throwing each other under the bus.
- We got really creative. No longer are we just going up to people on the streets or parks or supermarkets. Instead, we would rent a whole location and then film there over an entire week.
- The comedy community has embraced us, wholeheartedly. People that are more in the public and celebrity, but even stand-ups, sketch people on 'SNL,' those people - and it's been wonderful to have them embrace it.
- We started off in improv and sketch comedy, and with improv the most important thing is to listen and make sure you're not stepping over someone, so we've been trained for such a long time doing that.
- There have been prank shows that have been really elaborate, setting up fake car accidents and burglars. For us, we wanted to strip it down completely, didn't want to do anything that someone else couldn't do - a lot like the Jerky Boys.
- When we used to do improv, you'd have to learn how to listen and contribute and not talk over each other and learn timing, and you fall into roles where that permeates in your regular life as well.
- I was thinking about getting a dog myself, but just one!
- When someone else is getting punished you show up, you eat some lunch, you sit back because you're not going to do anything. But when you're the one that has to go, that whole day is a very miserable experience.
- We have a conversation before every season now and we just take inventory. Are we having fun? Can we do things? Can we push the envelope still? Can we evolve the show still? Are people still watching?
- For most people, my suffering is enjoyable. I suffer in a funny way.
- I grew up around women.
- 'Upright Citizens Brigade' was a huge influence on us. And growing up we never missed 'Saturday Night Live.'
- Every time we have a chance to mention it, we say we're from Staten Island. Because of some of the stereotypes, sometimes Staten Island gets a bad rap, and we're in a position to at least try to maybe change that perception.
- I never mind when I have to put my phone away at a concert. At all. I find I enjoy it much more, so I like the idea.
- We're not MTV, we're not teenagers. We kind of have a little bit more of an idea of who we are and what our comedy is because we've been doing it for so long.
- 'The Sopranos,' 'Lost,' 'Breaking Bad' and 'The Wire' - those are my all-times.
- Some of the best ugly sweaters, people really can't put their finger on the concept of the sweater itself.
- We're like this weird band, like a comedy band.
- We met in high school, all in the same grade, and started doing improv and sketch together. That was almost 20 years ago at this point, and that's our identity outside of 'Impractical Jokers.'
- I have three sisters, no brothers.
- People enjoy our misery so much, but honestly on those days, the days that you know that you're the one getting it, it's actually not a fun day for the person that's there. Everybody else is cool, the other three guys.
- Our fans are so rabid, the live shows, they actually feel like concerts.
- In this day and age, when no one can agree on anything, I think it's important that people can come home and turn on the TV and have some good old-fashioned laughs.
- The general feedback we get is I'm the best loser.
- We always try to evolve the show, and to break new ground within the universe of our show.
- We create real situations. Anything's fair game.
- I'm all about dissecting everything.
- What we get the most is, our fans want to hang out with us.
- 'Taste Buds' is a food debate show and 'Hey Babe!' is just kind of anything and everything.
- I am super respectful.
- There's just something about telling another giant in the New York baseball scene that you thought he was Derek Jeter.
- Not a lot of people in comedy grew up together and have been friends for 25 years.
- Movies aren't normally, necessarily viewed by a community of fans, and we thought if we could take the energy we see at our live performance and inject that into theaters, it might be a special thing.
- We're with each other 24/7 and that's not an exaggeration. But I think after 25 years it's like you are with your family basically. You're gonna have your dust-ups and fights and stuff, but we're all really hyper-aware of the good fortune we're having and how long it took us to get here.
- We've just seen so much love from our fans over the years, and we tour live nationally and internationally, and we see what the energy is like when all these people come together.
- Everything is real but we write the jokes too and improvise them.
- We did a lot of stuff just in theaters and we started putting it on the Internet.
- I like that by inherently having to make a group decision, you're really thorough. And I have a lot more confidence with a decision going forward if I know it's been thorough.
- We're with each other 24 hours a day. We film all week long. On weekends, we go on these tours. If we didn't have fun, it would be a problem.
