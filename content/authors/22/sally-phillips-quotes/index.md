- TV feels quite constipated, and the thing I find particularly difficult is the branding of the channels where it's not 'Is it a good script?' but 'Is it a BBC2 script?'
- One year you go in for auditions, and everybody thinks you're the queen of comedy, and the next year, you're so 'yesterday,' and it's not because you've done anything, or your ability has changed; you haven't been in work because you've been putting on weight and then trying to lose it.

- I have three boys, so I live in a household full of testosterone.
- It's quite confusing being one of the less wealthy people at a posh place.
- I have a lot of funny friends, though not everyone's funny all the time. Doon Mackichan's my funniest friend in the pub; Nina Conti's the funniest with a monkey.
- As a writer myself, my job has very often been to also write on the job. So you get the script and a vague idea of how the scene might work, and you then add funny words or change the script. I'm not the world's best writer or the world's best actor, but I can do that thing where I can fix - or ruin - fix-slash-ruin, add quirk, add value.
- I've got a great relationship with my dad, but I can imagine how annoying it would be if I had to move back into his house.
- Bad impulse buys make you feel grim, don't they? It's like having consumer Tourette's. I gravitate towards austere foreign-language film DVDs when insecure.
- I've got spider veins all over my legs, so I wear opaque tights all winter. All sorts of colours.
- I can make a virtue of slapdash. Slapdash can give you courage.
- I don't leave London, really, and I don't do theatre, because I want to put the kids to bed.
- The children break all my jewelry, so everything I wear is cheap - from Topshop or Dorothy Perkins.
- A lot of things in 'Parents' I find very truthful.
- I'm feeling incredibly Botox-tempted as my face collapses around my shoulders.

- I don't have the self-discipline for diets; I break rules I set for myself, so I try and eat more healthily, juice more, and avoid sugar.
- My mum's from Yorkshire and my parents aren't snotty or posh - they're very hard workers, both of them.
- My blood runs cold when I hear the 'great news' that we have found a marker for the Down's syndrome gene, which means we can identify it more easily. Why is that good news? It's only good news if you're going to terminate.
- I once had a friend who did the hair for sci-fi movies, and after a particularly bad break-up I stupidly went to her salon and told her she could do anything she liked. She dyed the bottom cherry red and the top peroxide blonde.
- What having a Down's syndrome child isn't - and I feel very strongly about this - is a tragedy. All those pregnancy books you read when you are expecting refer to Down's syndrome as if it were the worst possible outcome, and it's not.
- I definitely used to write a lot at school. Comic poetry and drawings about people.
- A Local Government Stationery Store is something to behold. It's like walking through the back of a cupboard into a really dull Narnia.

- I wasn't hugely popular at school. In fact, I was bullied at school.
- When I'm a brunette, it's four times harder to hail a taxi. Then I go blonde again, and suddenly there are taxis everywhere.

- I would love to have been around in the Keystone Studios days.
- If you get 10,000 guys to put their ideal woman into a computer, it still comes out looking like Angelina Jolie.
- Middle-aged women on telly is a bit of a hot topic - before, we were 27 to 37, and now we're 40 to 50. You do notice as you get older... you go past 35, and suddenly you're playing baddies.
- When I write, I create really absurd situations which become false because I am after the joke.
