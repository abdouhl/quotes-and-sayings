quotes = ['''When I came home, I was no longer the pariah who had dropped out of law school. I had been on TV. And everybody wanted to know, not only what being on TV was like, but what I thought about world events. Suddenly, there was some value to what I was saying. That's bizarre.''' ,'''You know, I'm glad that what I want doesn't necessarily always come true.''' ,'''My theory about L.A. is that it's almost like you have an allergy that's dormant and just need to be put in the right context for that allergy to come out. And L.A.'s like that in my mind. People who have any of that dormant blind ambition, it can easily come out in that context.''' ,'''I mean, the conservative movement in this country has been selling a pack of lies for a long time.''' ,'''I don't have any insight to Donald Trump that anyone else doesn't.''' ,'''I'm not of the ilk that there's something immoral about doing an unfunny sitcom - it just gets boring and unchallenging.''' ,'''There's been this sort of attitude in media in the past in this country that it's not our job to fall on one side or the other. But what I'm suggesting is that in this day and age, there is no deciding not to fall on one side of the other. You're going to be on a side, so you've got to lean in and choose the right one.''' ,'''But I started out as a comedian doing sketch work where you get to write, produce and direct your own stuff.''' ,'''Donald Trump's own intelligence is publicly saying that Russia is actively trying to help him and hurt Joe Biden.''' ,'''I believe there should be enforcement and redevelopment of anti-trust laws that fully regulate the media.''' ,'''Cable news is nothing more than entertainment, except for the International version of CNN and perhaps the BBC.''' ,'''We tune in to news companies for them to give us some sense of grounded assessment of what the truth is.''' ,'''Mike Cernovich is not everything that's wrong with society, but he is definitely the low hanging fruit of what's wrong with society.''' ,'''I think what should happen is companies should calculate how much money they're getting from people who are celebrating Christmas and provide exactly that much amount of Merry Christmas, because that is exactly how I would want any type of religious holiday to be celebrated.''' ,'''But I will say this, look, I don't think that there's anyone in the country who thinks that impeachment's going to lead to Donald Trump leaving office. The point is, you need to put down a marker as to who is accountable, what the President can get away with.''' ,'''There are a lot of things about the TV industry that make you try to change who you are to fit into a certain mold.''' ,'''Bin Laden is living in the United States, and he has blonde hair. He's probably got some type of eating disorder. And he drinks too much, and then occasionally writes an op-ed under the name Ann Coulter.''' ,'''With comedic actors, you can write one joke or two jokes, sample dialogue, and they have the capacity to extrapolate.''' ,'''Because, listen, I'm terrified at the idea that Donald Trump could be the president of the United States.''' ,'''You cannot avoid controversy in this day and age - you really only can pick sides.''' ,'''This is the thing Donald Trump is doing. He may be an embarrassment, but what he's actually doing is reflecting back on Republicans exactly what their positions are.''' ,'''I mean, what was really interesting is that, you know, Ted Cruz put out this ad with little kids saying that Donald Trump essentially is pretending to be a Republican, which is a little bit odd because Ted Cruz is not been the biggest Republican Party booster, right.''' ,'''I quit law school in 1990 and started doing stand up in Boston.''' ,'''The mainstream is not the mainstream anymore. We're a lot more niched in our media.''' ,'''Donald Trump got impeached for his Ukraine Plan A and the economy went down the tubes, thanks to his failure to deal with the Coronavirus.''' ,'''The days where you could just step back and not pick a side are over.''' ,'''I look like a very nice, benign Jewish man-boy.''' ,'''I mean, Donald Trump has been able, because of Mitch McConnell, to seat more circuit court judges almost than Barack Obama did in eight years.''' ,'''There has been an attempt to pull in a more cable mentality to the big networks - from NBC hiring Scott Sassa from TNT, to FOX hiring Herzog from Comedy Central.''' ,'''I wanted to do something I could show my grandkids and say that this is my comedic vision.''' ,'''I think what happens normally in a narrative film is that the camera constructs the reality.''' ,'''Listen, as far as the war on Christmas goes, I feel like we should be waging a war on Christmas.''' ,'''Now, a big part of Donald Trump's campaign strategy has been to try and undermine the legitimacy of the election. Then, if he loses, he can just dismiss the whole thing as corrupt and claim victory anyway.''' ,'''The success that I have in sitcoms comes from the fact that 60 percent of the writers are Jewish guys in their early to late 40s.''' ,'''Either you're a political comedian or you're a stand-up. Just talking about politics isn't enough. People who talk about airplane food, you don't call them airplane comedians.''' ,'''There's an argument that private debt, in some way, is creating indentured servants in our country. But public debt does not do that. In fact, public debt does the exact opposite - it relieves private debt.''' ,'''My influences as a comedian and filmmaker are Albert Brooks, Lenny Bruce, Woody Allen, Andy Kaufman and John Cassevettes.''' ,'''I don't have great thoughts about a lot of Republican candidates.''' ,'''You know, actors say, 'There are no bad roles, there are only bad actors.' Well, comedians, because they're also writers, believe that there are in fact bad roles.''' ,'''I think there's a real hunger out there for new voices who will speak more truth to power and who are less ensconced in the establishment machine.''' ,'''Remember, Donald Trump's Plan A for reelection was to get Ukraine to dig up dirt on Joe Biden, and then to use that to go after him.''' ,'''I feel like I don't mind acting in a sitcom because it pays well and is good exposure, but I don't feel like, comedically, what I have to say I can say on a show that needs to draw 14 million each week.''' ,'''Because there is something psychologically wrong with you on some level if you want to be on TV, if the only way you can fulfill yourself is by literally going from three dimensions to two dimensions.''' ,]
