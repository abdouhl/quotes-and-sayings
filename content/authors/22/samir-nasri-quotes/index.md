- Sometimes it is a good thing to hear what kids have to tell you. Kids just tell the truth.

When you've been out for a year, and you think it's over, you think completely differently after that. I was just looking on TV, and I wasn't able to train, and in the meantime, I had a son.

- If you win the Carling Cup, it can give you confidence, and sometimes, when you haven't won a trophy, you become scared of winning.

- Remember that before joining Arsenal, I was at Marseille where it was easy for me because I was with my family; I was born there and had played for them since I was nine. I came here on my own, and you grow up more quickly that way. It made a difference, because now I have become a man.
