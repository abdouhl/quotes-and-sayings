- The wise are above books.
- The stars that have most glory have no rest.
- Striving to tell his woes, words would not come; For light cares speak, when mighty griefs are dumb.
- Custom, that is before all law; Nature, that is above all art.
- And for the few that only lend their ear, That few is all the world.
- We come to know best what men are, in their worse jeopardizes.
- By adversity are wrought the greatest works of admiration, and all the fair examples of renown, out of distress and misery are grown.
- Beauty, sweet love, is like the morning dew, Whose short refresh upon tender green, Cheers for a time, but till the sun doth show And straight is gone, as it had never been.
- Love is a sickness full of woes, All remedies refusing; A plant that with most cutting grows, Most barren with best using.
