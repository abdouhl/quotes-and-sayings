- There is no comparison to English fans.
- Chelsea is a fantastic club.
- Money is not the most important to me.
- I just want to see more understanding and less racism in sports.
- Jose Mourinho is one of the best managers with whom I have worked. I had a chance not only to have him as a coach but as a colleague, a friend, a big brother. I had a chance to learn from him, and he was open to receiving advice from me as well, even though I think he knew it all.
- Why don't you think we should dream of an African team winning the World Cup for the first time? People never allow this thought to cross their minds, and it is shameful. When you try to even say it, people look at you as if you're joking, but they forget that dreaming is the first step to success.
- It's not all about the figures. It's about how you play for the team, how you help your colleagues, how you work defensively.
- My job is to score goals.
- Football is beautiful. Football is beautiful because whether you win, draw, or lose, you can go and shake your opponent's hand, whether they're white or black or red or blue.
- Of course it's normal for people to say, 'Yeah, this player changed teams because of the money.' That could be the case sometimes, but after a certain level of success? No.

- You can't promise to win a game, but you can want to win a game.

- Guardiola has never been a great player; he was just a good player.
- I was 15 when I made my debut for the national team.
- I experienced great sadness with our elimination from the 1990 World Cup, with many penalties. I still have that feeling of injustice in me.
- If one of my own makes a mistake, they judge us all. Tomorrow, if a white man in Africa makes a mistake, we should judge all white people? No!

- It's good to dream, and I was born a dreamer.
- I left Cameroon when I was 13 years old, and I've lived more in Europe than Africa.
- A child comes to see his father play, have fun, make people happy, and what does he see? He sees people booing his father for being black. They make monkey noises. They throw bananas at his teammates and all that.
- Chelsea were looking at me, and one day I would love to play in The Premiership - for the fans, not the money. They can be losing 4-0 and still be cheering. That, more than anything, would attract me to The Premiership.
- In all things, you need a good organization. You can have the best player in the world; if you do not have the best team, you will not win.
- Nobody wins or loses a match; it's the team that wins or loses. You have to be looking to contribute towards the team goal.

- At Barca, we always have an obligation to win and to do it in style for our fans in the stadiums and around the world.
- It would be great to win the Ballon d'Or, but first, I'm thinking about the team's interest and not my personal ones.
- I had to deal with it so often, I found ways of making a point against racism. When I played against Real Zaragoza, they chanted like monkeys and threw peanuts on the pitch.

- I might live in Europe, but I sleep in Africa.
- I come from one of the poorest countries in the world, and Cameroon is also one of the most beautiful countries in the world.
- I can only say what I have lived and experienced. And the majority of people who have been to Makhachkala have come back with different opinions. It's a relaxed city but very lively, like many of the capitals in the world. At first sight, you would never say that there are political problems.
- I work hard at my job.
- People can attack me personally, say what they want - I don't give a damn.

- I wanted to prove that a young boy coming from Africa was able to succeed and achieve a lot.
- Everything God gives me, I take, and he's given enormously during my career.
