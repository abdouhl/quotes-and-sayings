- I became a minister of the Eucharist when I was 17. My parents aren't very strict Catholics, but for some reason I decided this is what I want to do, and I have kept it up.
- I have blessed hands. I got my hands blessed by the priest, and I am able to give out Holy Communion at Mass. It is lovely to be part of it.
- I love the dog. She comes for drives with me in the back of my car. Darby is not aggressive or judgmental. She just is. That's what I love about her. She sits there and watches 'The Fugitive' with me.
- When I have to switch back and forth, it's not hard to go from the American accent to speaking Spanish, but then speaking Spanish and going back into the American accent is hard. I practice it so much. I talk to myself in the mirror all the time. It's like speaking multiple languages.
- I think a handful of the roles that I've gotten to play are characters whom I've lived that are like younger versions of me but who are maybe more naive and a little bit wilder than when I was. And I've gotten to play 16 and 17 when I was a little bit older, so I got to pull from experience.
- You know what it is, when I'm playing a role sometimes, I just tend to stay in that role. It's easier to maintain. We just shot a pilot in a very thick American accent. I feel like the character lives in me. Of course, my family tease me about it.
- I played a doctor on 'Counterpart', so that was about studying and watching documentaries and reading and trying to learn.
- You have to give every portion of yourself to it. As an artist, that is just what you do - because we love it - we were born to do it.
- I think you are taken more seriously as a young adult when you are on a film set and you are doing a job and people expect something from you. Is that losing my youth? Not at all. I had a fantastic childhood.
- I started acting when I was really young. I came to the States and didn't know anyone, and I spoke with a weird Irish accent.
- I couldn't imagine falling in love with someone on set. But then, maybe that is one of the messages of 'Halal Daddy.' You never know when and with whom you'll find love.
- My grandmother was a huge influence on me. She allowed me to be my flamboyant self as a kid. She babysat me; auditions came later - by later, I mean six years old. She sang and played piano, and I'd sit beside her. I don't know how confident I am, but I think you need it to survive in this industry.
- What's wonderful about acting is that you get to play different roles. For instance, in 'Amelie,' I played a young mother. Some of the photoshoots, you're playing a role. I like to be able to look at a photo and say, 'Wow - that isn't even me.' I enjoy being able to project.
- Ireland's always going to be my home, but so much is filmed in L.A., so you have to spend time out here.
