- My audience is going to die before I do.
- I was a big Nancy Drew reader. Nancy figures it out. Case closed.
- Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves, Robert Lincoln bought a nice ski lodge.
- One night last summer, all the killers in my head assembled on a stage in Massachusetts to sing show tunes.
- I discovered that Robert Todd Lincoln was there for each of the first three assassinations. I wanted to write about the Lincoln Memorial, so when I found out he had attended its dedication, that helped focus it further.
- I didn't come from any kind of academic background, but I lived in a college town and I knew people who weren't without pretense. There was this idea in the town that if something was European it would be good.
- The Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Civil War - when I really think about them, they all seem about as likely as the parting of the Red Sea.
- Not that I want the current president killed. I will, for the record and for the FBI agent assigned to read this and make sure I mean no harm, clearly state that while I am obsessed with death, I am against it.

- The one time I was an actor, it happened to be in a globally dominant juggernaut. That was lucky.
- I loved that these two guys argued with each other as if movies actually mattered. Nobody I knew talked about movies that way, but Siskel and Ebert took each movie as it came and talked about whether it was a success on its own terms.
- I get younger people who watch Conan or The Daily Show, but before that it was mostly people who knew me from public radio. Those people are kind of old.
- I hated the lost colony; in second grade, we were doing American History, and they said, We don't know what happened to them. That drove me nuts. That lost colony drove me crazy.
- I seem to have no problem revealing my crush on the man who murdered Lincoln.
- In death, you get upgraded into a saint no matter how much people hated you in life.
- Part of the success of This American Life, I think, is due to the fact that none of us sound like we should be on the radio. We don't sound professional; we sound like people you would know.
- Jesus and Lincoln, Moses and Jefferson can seem so long gone, so unbelievable, so dead.
- While I gave up God a long time ago, I never shook the habit of wanting to believe in something. So I replaced my creed of everlasting life with life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
- History is full of really good stories. That's the main reason I got into this racket: I want to make the argument that history is interesting.
