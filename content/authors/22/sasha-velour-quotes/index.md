quotes = ['''Just in my experience as a drag queen, I've been able to connect with queer people around the world - and to see them connecting with each other over a shared love of drag!''' ,'''The audience of 'Drag Race' and the fans of drag queens are often very surprising.''' ,'''I think sometimes you have to imagine a fantasy world in which we are represented and visible the way we should be.''' ,'''I want to see some queer politicians, some drag queens and drag kings running for office and shifting the way that policy is made as well.''' ,'''Even though I present myself at the height of glamour and beauty, part of my truth is being desperate and emotional and unafraid of being unattractive.''' ,'''The loss of my mom really inspired me to go to a place with my performances that were emotionally honest, and I found that audiences really responded to that. People need to see heartbreak transformed into beauty.''' ,'''For a while, my favorite movie was 'Vertigo.' Everything in that movie was captivating to me.''' ,'''The truth is I do take drag really seriously, and I think that there's kind of a place for that - to see it as this political and historical art form, and to want to continue pushing it in new directions. And also honor the old directions as well. So I'm sort of like a drag intellectual/drag queen.''' ,'''There's so many more themes of drag than just fierceness.''' ,'''It's important in drag to challenge things and present your own vision.''' ,'''I hope we see more avenues for representation. More TV shows and films starring queer people, especially QPOC and nonbinary folks, more mainstream press coverage of our artwork and fashion, and more representation of our interests within politics.''' ,'''Right when I was starting to experiment with drag, my mom was diagnosed with cancer, and during her chemo treatment, she lost all of her hair. And for her, the idea of being a fem with no hair was really difficult.''' ,'''I want to do something that is not just a pastiche of drag that's come before but is really authentically me. I try to tune out all the drag that's out there and tap into the drag that I was doing when I was a little kid - when I didn't even know the word 'queer' or that gay people were out there.''' ,'''Drag should push the limits of what is considered fashionable or beautiful.''' ,'''I hope that people look at Brooklyn as kind of a drag utopia, because that's what it's been in my experience - all genders and bodies and ages doing drag.''' ,'''My favorite thing about drag is taking one idea and flipping it on its head entirely.''' ,'''I love being kind of reserved and serious and then having these explosions of passion when it comes time to perform.''' ,'''The cities that I go to where I can tell that they have a lot of different types of drag, I tell them that they remind me of Brooklyn, and I mean that as the highest compliment in the entire world.''' ,'''We still live in a country where there's disproportionate violence faced by our community, especially trans people and trans people of color. I think activism within the queer community continues to need to focus on those issues first.''' ,'''I find inspiration in the movies I've loved, especially all films ever made about Dracula.''' ,'''Drag resists conservatism in the most basic way possible, and also in the most effective way possible, because it's improper when it comes to looks, which is everything in conservative systems.''' ,'''I've found that embracing the things that make me a little strange and different from other people, and learning to love that, makes me feel beautiful and fashionable every day.''' ,'''That's what I wanted 'Pirate Jenny' to be: a queer, revolutionary fairy tale for the people that I love.''' ,'''I grew up in this house of intellectuals, and for me, it wasn't, like, a negative thing. And what I've discovered is, for a lot of people, it is. But I think knowing history, liking to talk about ideas - like, I just genuinely like to geek out and go on these intellectual thought journeys.''' ,'''Identity for Jews like us was shaped by cultural practices and family traditions rather than allegiances of place or language or class, because those things continued to be redefined for us. Drag operates along similar lines.''' ,'''I'd say my fashion or beauty tip is to take the thing about you that makes you most distinctive and then exaggerate it. So if you have a little bushy unibrow, make it a dramatic unibrow. If you're balding, go completely bald.''' ,'''I love 'Threepenny Opera'; I was exposed to it as a little kid because my parents, my mom and my dad, had bonded, when they were dating, over 'Threepenny Opera' and introduced it to me, a child, who could barely understand it. But I immediately gravitated even from that early age.''' ,'''People are so serious about ourselves, and drag suggests that maybe it's all just a bunch of ideas, and we can be a little bit more flexible with them.''' ,'''Taking care of your mental health is important, and being able to model that for queer people who are out there every day dealing with their own struggles is very significant.''' ,'''I'm an only child; I'm a very private person.''' ,'''When it comes to drag, my favorite thing we can do is kind of push against the beauty standards of magazines. We don't need to look like supermodels. That what really makes drag special and makes it unique and makes it queer.''' ,'''It is important to me to keep fighting for the rights of those who cannot.''' ,'''The way I've always looked at drag has been a little bit different maybe than other people because the drag community that I started doing drag in is full of trans people and women and people of various educational backgrounds, of different ages.''' ,'''I've always been committed to tuning out the trends of drag and doing styles and fashions and performances that are really true to what I love, to the movie references I've always loved, fashion that speaks to me for whatever reason - no matter what people say.''' ,'''Queer art is as much about starting conversations as it is about making dramatic statements.''' ,'''Drag, at its core, is about honoring yourself and your own unique way of being a gendered, queer person. Your own unique way of using fashion to express yourself.''' ,'''From the second there was drag, trans people were doing it. And when cis women started being allowed in theaters, then cis women doing drag was part of theater.''' ,'''Uniformity is not very interesting or sustainable - it's boring.''' ,'''We need to talk about representation for queer people in the media and also in law.

Everyone is important and valuable.''' ,'''People started bringing their own personal work to 'Nightgowns,' and that's really when it started to become a really distinctive show.''' ,'''I'm certainly not inventing anything new with drag.''' ,'''There are some amazing people around who can tell stories about drag from the '60s and in New York, like the amazing club kid drag. About drag from around the world. So people should be asking questions and listening to stories.''' ,'''I like a little Barbra Streisand!''' ,'''There are so many voices that tell people, especially queer people, that they don't have importance and regality.''' ,'''What I love so much about drag is that it has politics at its very core; drag performers aren't afraid to talk about politics in our community and the changes we need to see systemically in society.''' ,'''Drag is literally so ancient that it predates modern understanding of gender, of transness, of queerness. Drag predates modern ideas of gender, of theater at all. Drag predates the word 'drag' itself.''' ,'''My favorite diva is Dame Shirley Bassey from the U.K. I just love that every song she sings becomes crazy and intense with feeling. That's how I feel in my daily life.''' ,'''I have an art magazine about drag called 'Velour,' named after myself, and I have a monthly show called 'Nightgowns' that curates and presents some of the most creative and high-quality drag in a professional theater setting.''' ,'''Even if I hadn't won 'Drag Race,' even if I'd never been on, I'd still be working my tail off, creating live shows, magazines, videos, anything I possibly could!''' ,'''It's so beautiful that drag is able to speak to so many different types of people.''' ,'''I've learned that I am a complete workaholic and that no amount of sleeplessness or exhaustion will keep me from taking on new or ambitious projects. That is both a good quality and a terrible one, I think.''' ,'''Siouxsie Sioux was such an inspiration when I was a teenager because I connected with these goth college students who listened to this genre of music. She showed me that femininity didn't necessarily have to look the way that I was familiar with. It could be more exciting and much more identifiable.''' ,'''I want to be an ambassador of Brooklyn.''' ,'''I've always wanted to play a role as a producer and a curator and to help make drag really have an epic scale and a large audience and a lot of interest.''' ,'''Racism is a problem everywhere, especially in this country, but all over the world, and especially within queer space.''' ,'''I discovered that my drag really does speak to people on an emotional level. I also discovered that people are sometimes put off by an intellectual approach to drag.''' ,'''When I was in high school, I used to beg my teachers to let me create films and plays instead of writing essays. I think they were at least happy I was excited about school.''' ,'''I've always tried to twist the ideas of beauty that are maybe considered to be ugly by the mainstream. I was already kind of toying with that when it comes to baldness, which came from a discussion with my mother about how to be considered a beautiful woman if you're bald.''' ,'''A superstar doesn't just use the spotlight for themselves.''' ,'''I love biting off way more than I can chew, and that's a great motivator because it forces me to rise to the occasion.''' ,'''People are really seeing that drag is an art form, that it's so much more than self-expression.''' ,'''When I started doing drag, I always put together multimedia elements for live performance.''' ,'''I try to write an essay every time I speak.''' ,'''It was definitely my grandmother who introduced me to fashion.''' ,'''I'm a drag queen who is thoughtful and serious about drag in addition to being funny, ambitious, and glamourous.''' ,'''The political nature of 'Threepenny Opera' is immediately visible. I just think that that's not always a part of acceptable and fun entertainment that we're exposed to - that political side.''' ,'''For me, my greatest weakness is also my greatest strength: I'm a complete overthinker about everything.''' ,'''I want to show people it's not elitist to be a deep thinker.''' ,'''Everyone who passes through 'Drag Race,' and especially the people who are able to have really big careers after the show, has a responsibility to the queer community to do a good job of representing queer people across the board to be kind and loving.''' ,'''A lot of people still have the idea that drag goes from one end of the gender spectrum to the other end of the gender spectrum, and they expect drag queens to be masculine out of drag and hyper-feminine in drag. I think that portrays a lot of binary thinking and, ultimately, a lot of misogyny.''' ,'''No matter what you're doing, whether it's a makeup tutorial or an interview or a lip sync, performance is the essence of drag. It is gender performance. Being able to produce a performance is what a superstar has to do.''' ,'''Some people play it safe in the world of drag - I'm guilty of it myself, sometimes - but I hope to always be a voice that encourages people to buck trends, follow their instincts, and do good in the world.''' ,'''I want to do performance that inspires people to be true to themselves and has tangible impact on the community. Not just because I want to be a role model - I just think it's the best way to honor the tradition of drag.''' ,'''I think Bianca Del Rio should be in politics.''' ,'''I want to follow in RuPaul's footsteps, which is that combination of not just personal stardom but to really transform myself into a producer of drag. That's the way to make a lasting impact on the world of drag and... to make actual differences in the queer community. I think there's no better model for that than RuPaul.''' ,'''The truth is, a lot of people go to drag shows, really, for very light entertainment, and I think sometimes maybe we don't even give the audiences enough credit as to what they'd be down for.''' ,'''My own experience of gender has been about a lot of fluidity. In drag, I like to combine aspects of masculinity and femininity and rewrite the rules for those.''' ,'''Absolutely anyone can and must do drag.''' ,'''I went to Vassar College for undergraduate and studied literature and queer theory, and all of the above. And then I took a Fulbright scholarship in Russia.''' ,'''Unfortunately, this world is not an easy place.''' ,'''At the end of the day, I just love drag so much that it's not enough for me to be a successful drag queen. I want to do right by my drag community as a whole... creating opportunities for other performers, documenting and uplifting amazing drag, and generally just contributing a lot of love and respect to our fabulous little world!''' ,'''I'd like to see drag really cultivate its political roots.''' ,'''Trans women, trans men, AFAB - which is assigned female at birth - and non-binary performers, but especially trans women of color, have been doing drag for literal centuries and deserve to be equally represented and celebrated alongside cis men.''' ,'''The inspiration of my drag is the history of drag, the long tradition of drag queens being at the forefront of queer activism. That informs my drag style, and in a sense, that is the direction we need to go in the future.''' ,'''Pride, to me, is a celebration of the past because we have come such a long way from the very first Pride parade marking the anniversary of the Stonewall riots, so it's a celebration of all that we've accomplished.''' ,'''Drag has always inspired people to come together to be joyous and fight for what matters. If we can do it through beauty and positivity and lip-syncing our favorite pop songs, then let's do it.''' ,'''I love that drag is political. For me, one of the reasons I started doing drag was reading about how in the past, drag performers were able to organize the queer community and move us forward.''' ,'''I love hearing the same songs over and over again - as long as queens challenge themselves to come up with new ways of performing them.''' ,'''To costume yourself in the way that you fantasize, to make that a reality, and then to go right into the universe looking like an exceptional being takes a lot of courage.''' ,''''Drag Race' has made a lot more people into fans of drag, and that's allowed local communities to grow and flourish, but it's up to individual queens to share the spotlight with their communities. I definitely want to be one of the people who does that.''' ,'''Drag performance is really emotional.''' ,'''Purple has always been my favorite color... but purple, when I was a little kid, was a color that boys weren't really allowed to wear. That's what all the kids at school told me. I filled my wardrobe with as much purple as I could possibly find, because who cares? Life's too short to dress by other people's rules.''' ,'''I really believe in the power of playing by your own rules.''' ,'''As a drag performer, my identity exists in music, art, and fashion, not in any one 'language' of gender or 'appearance.'''' ,'''I've loved the RuPaul model of drag, where you're an amazing drag queen, you're a smart and savvy business person, and you use those together to keep drag at the forefront of what people are talking about.''' ,''''Drag Race' really offered me a platform to have a lot of people listen to what I have to show them, and I want to showcase the whole community I know.''' ,]
