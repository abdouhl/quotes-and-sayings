- I'm always under the impression that directors should act at some point or another.
- I get very picky. There's sort of a line you have to walk between working and doing something you actually want to be a part of, as opposed to just working for the work. That often puts you in a place where you have to choose whether or not you want to wait for good material to come along.
- Just to get the basic fundamentals and empathy - I think that's the most important thing to bring to it if you've acted in the past and are now a director: the empathy.
- It can be a detriment to yourself to not be working, but at the same time, you want to hold true to what you're wanting to be working on.
