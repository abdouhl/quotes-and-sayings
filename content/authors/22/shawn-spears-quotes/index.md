- AEW is history-making. When the chance presented itself to be a part of something so groundbreaking, I wasn't going to wait around any longer.
- I'll say it loud and proud: AEW has raised the bar. Everyone is doing better, because they have come along.
- Bobby Roode is the kind of guy who will stab anyone in the back to get what he wants.
- I did things right, I never got into any trouble. I was professional and I carried myself well and always did what I was asked to do.
- I believe in professionalism and I believe in putting on the best possible match regardless of the scenario for our audience.
- In order to stay ahead of the young talent, you have to pay attention. You have to see what young talents are doing, and I see what a lot of young talents are doing.
- But, a lot of people thought that I came into AEW to go right into the main event and right to the top of the mountain and get all the titles thrown on you and push, push, push, push. Not the case, exactly.
- All talent needs is credibility and the freedom to create. That is all. That's what will make the talent happy, that's what makes me happy to this day.
- A great deal of WWE Superstars, like Dolph Ziggler, Bray Wyatt, Baron Corbin, Sheamus, Braun Strowman, The Miz, etc., came from WWE's developmental system, and I've had the privilege of working with them over the years.

- The reality is if you tell people something long enough, good or bad, they're going to believe it. And for a while the picture painted was that I wasn't exactly a favorable character.
- My motivation level here in NXT has always been high. I believe it's one of my stronger attributes.
- I believe in giving back to the industry of professional wrestling that has given me a great deal in my life.
- In terms of my wife, she obviously is a Monday nighter and doing very well. I watch her, I watch when she's on, and kinda give her feedback when she asks for it and she'll watch when I am on and she'll kinda give me feedback of what she thought was good and bad.
- Talent needs credibility.
- If you piled in a car and you go to an AEW show with all your buddies there, you had a beer or two, and you get to yell at whoever you want, you get to cheer for whoever you want, you get to chant, like those moments are friend making moments.
- I got goosebumps kind of thinking about it now because this is Tully Blanchard. This is a Hall of Famer. This is one of the greatest of all time, and he still has it.
- I don't quit and can't be broken. I have been through every up and down you can imagine in the world of sports-entertainment and I am still here running strong.
- Tyler Breeze is an incredible talent. I worked with him a little bit in NXT, but not to the level where I had hoped.
- I work a little bit of slower, methodical pace. I'm able to implement certain different styles depending on who my opponent is.
- In terms of the coaching aspect and things like that, I've always been someone that prides themselves in helping young talent.
- In terms of being able to adapt to any situation on any given night, in any given moment and that just comes with nearly twenty years of experience and paying attention to the guys that I've tried to emulate throughout my career.
- I've always said that if I can make 20 years in-ring, anything beyond that is just a cherry on top, so 2020 I'm looking to challenging and healthy so hopefully if I can do two of those things, I'm pretty sure it's going to be a good year for me.
- I believe that if you stay positive and you keep your nose to the ground and you keep working hard for every inch that eventually will pay off and something will roll your way.

- A lot of people will say they strive and drive to be the best in the industry and I get that, but for me, I think I'm just pushing to be the best version of myself that I can be.
- I love being out there. as an audience member. It gives the audience a little bit of something different. Like, why are these wrestlers sitting in the audience? And why are they heckling at this guy and that guy?
- I have a lot of history with Eric Young, he actually trained me in the very beginning of my career. We go back a very long way.
- Regardless of what happens, when I'm seventy years old, I can look back and say that I did this the way I wanted to, on my terms, and I gave it everything I got.
- When the bell rings in between the ropes, I'm in charge. No one can touch me. That's my time, no one can touch me.
- The day leading up to the Royal Rumble was pretty routine. I got up early, went to the gym, got a good meal in and then packed my bags to head to the Alamodome.

- But this is sports entertainment, so things can change on a daily basis. For that reason you have to be ready to go at any time.
- My first time around in WWE, there wasn't the WWE Network. We weren't as big. It was much harder to crack through and get to the audience.
- I'm not just a pretty face.
- If you are watching television and two guys come out and you are already able to tell what the finish of that match is based on entrances alone, that's a problem.

- I did commentary with Excalibur. It is an extremely, extremely difficult job. It gave me a whole new appreciation to how on point you need to be and how careful you need to because I was a almost like a color aspect of it.
- Behind the scenes, I'm not a politicker. I have a very hard time telling somebody they're right when I feel they're wrong, and I have a very hard time telling somebody they're good when I feel they're not. That's just me.
- AJ Styles and Randy Orton, I've never worked with them before. I don't need to give you any of their accolades, the world knows them already.
- Now, I don't even consider NXT a developmental system. It's its own brand. So many guys were able to develop a following while in NXT.
- I'm coming to AEW because I believe in what they are doing.
