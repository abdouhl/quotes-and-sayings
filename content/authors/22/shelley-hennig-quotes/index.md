- I was the happiest in English class, and algebra was where I cried.
- My favorite movie is 'Closer' and 'Love Story.'
- People ask me, 'How's 'Teen Wolf?' and I tell them it's literally the best job I've ever had. It's hard. Everybody wants to be a series regular. It's something that a lot of actors would kill to have. That being said, it's very demanding of you, in so many different ways.
- I was the fastest typist in my school, and I had an obsession with spelling and memorizing.
- I worked at a local country club that I never belonged to. I did random tasks in the pro shop and supposed to be in charge of the register, but that didn't go so well. They quickly realized I was better with people, not computers.
- My favorite song is Whitney Houston's 'I Will Always Love You' because my brother used to sing it to me as loud as he could. Annoying then, favorite memory now.
- Personally, in real life, I'm a little more down-and-dirty than I am glamorous.
- I replaced someone on 'Days of our Lives' once, and the fans hated me. She was a redhead, I was a brunette: they went nuts. Even at fan events, they were rude to me.
- I grew up in Louisiana - a little suburb right outside of New Orleans - and I wouldn't have it any other way!
- I had no idea what I wanted to be when I was 17. I just knew I wanted to be something larger than myself.
- People called me 'Slim' and 'Daddy Long Legs.' My best friend Martine named me Daddy Long Legs after she saw me running track. She was making fun of me!
- I was a good student, but I was the biggest procrastinator.
- My brothers were my idols. I've always looked up to them and was proud to be their baby sister. I felt like they gave me some cool points, too.
- I'm personally more of a low-maintenance type of person. I want things to be easy and quick, especially when it comes to getting dressed.
- I love to eat. I'm from New Orleans. I eat like nobody's business. So to find a workout that I actually look forward to is a lifesaver.
- I'm actually loving the soundtrack to 'The Secret Circle' that our music supervisor Liza Richardson puts together, like Washed Out and Cults, but my favorite band is Bootstraps.
