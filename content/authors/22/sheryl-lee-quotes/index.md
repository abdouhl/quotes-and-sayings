- The more we deny that we have a dark side, the more power it has over us.
- Well, there's two things that happen when people experience something, whether it's a song, a television show, a film, a book or any piece of art. It connects them to a certain part of their life and whatever was going on at that time in their life.
- I remembered their songs but I had never owned a Beatles album.

- But I'm attracted to roles where I get to really go in and explore a character.
