quotes = ['''I don't think American family sitcoms are mean. I guess I really love 'Arrested Development.' I guess they are quite mean in that, but that is also a very silly, surreal, absurd show as well, and it has got a heart as well.''' ,'''I don't really view myself as an actor.''' ,'''I like to dress up and look nice. I'm not quite at the stage yet financially to do that too often, but it's nice to push the boat out a little bit for award ceremonies and stuff.''' ,''''The Inbetweeners' would have been a success with a totally different cast because the scripts are good - so while we were fortunate enough to be cast in it, we feel we still have a lot to prove.''' ,'''People assume that because you are on TV you must be a millionaire, but unfortunately it doesn't work like that.''' ,'''If people are asking me for clubbing tips, then they're in real trouble. My clubbing tip is never go to a club, because they're horrible and I hate them. I'm more of a dinner party guy.''' ,'''If anything, 'Friday Night Dinner' is quite mean. All these pranks that we play on each other, there's a lot of hitting and slapping and jumping at each other trying to scare each other. But underneath it all it is a family, so we all love each other.''' ,'''I think everyone thinks their dad is a little bit odd or crazy. As they get older, they develop their own little habits. They have a certain way that they like to live their life, and nothing is going to interrupt that.''' ,'''I get paid very well and am happy with what I make, but I'm not in the super-rich bracket. I shop in a supermarket like everyone else.''' ,'''When it comes to female fan attention, I'm married, so obviously I avoid the places where you might get unwanted female attention - clubs and social environments, bars and public spaces.''' ,'''The thing with TV and filming is the timing is all faked anyway. You do it so many times, from so many different angles. You never really do it all in one go anyway, so they just fix it all in the edit.''' ,'''I always felt that my way into comedy would be through my writing rather than my acting.''' ,'''Fans of the 'Inbetweeners' like the show because it is about four normal people, average guys or lower than average losers.''' ,'''It's a very strange and quite terrifying experience to watch yourself on TV. I never like to do it with other people.''' ,'''I enjoy watching sitcoms where the team behind it have successfully created a whole alternate reality that you can enter into for half an hour every week.''' ,]
