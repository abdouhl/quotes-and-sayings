- I am a big movie buff. So, I make sure I watch two-three movies a week, not many because I don't want to get addicted.

- You never know what your best is. I can't limit myself to a 60 and say it is my best. If I can chase any total and if I win matches for India, then only it would be my best.
- It's funny, because earlier, I used to have questions about how you coped with the seniors in the team, and now I get questions about how you're guiding these juniors.
- The loss in the final of the 2017 World Cup really inspired me to do a lot better. I worked a lot on my batting as I didn't want to go back to that phase again.
- My batting mentality is to see the ball and hit it. I don't know what bowlers see while batting.
- I used to feel like not scoring runs is the worst thing in life but I started thinking: 'No, at least I'm getting to go out on the field wearing the Indian jersey.' Not many get to do that. I am lucky. Now, if I get runs or don't get runs, I'm just going out there trying to enjoy my cricket.
- When I am in my India jersey, I don't want to be looking glamorous.
- On the ground, I am a professional cricketer - I don't need to wear lipstick. If I want to look good, I know when to wear make-up. I do not accept it being put on my face when I am wearing the India kit.
- When the team is doing well, individual performances don't count.
- I don't think that I've scored these many runs or I've achieved these things, because I believe it is something that doesn't help me. Whenever I go out to bat, it's a fresh start.
- I'm mostly a quiet person by nature and don't like letting my emotions come out on the field.

- If you look at our domestic scores in T20s, it is generally around 110-120. I think we all need to go back, step up our domestic circuit, take those scores to 140-150. If that is happening then all the batters will come with the same mindset of playing a fearless brand of cricket.
- If you get out back-to-back in T20s, it proves costly.
- The other thing I like is spending time with my family. I keep helping mom with cooking. I guess washing utensils has become part of my daily routine and I love troubling my brother as well. It's my favourite pastime.
- Whenever I go out to bat, my only responsibility is to look at the scoreboard and think what India needs from me at this moment.
- It gets frustrating when my male counterparts are questioned about their game or performance, whereas I am fielding questions on gender stereotypes and my ability to stay committed to the game on account of my gender.
- First I wanted number seven since my roll number in school was seven. But, someone was already wearing jersey number seven. Then a BCCI manager said I should take 18 since my birthday is on 18 July. At that time, I didn't know that Virat Kohli also wears number 18.
- In the last two World Cups, I realised that when you put a lot of pressure on yourself, it does not work.
- Whenever we have some time to ourselves I prefer to go back to my room and hit the bed. Even while travelling on a bus, I put on my sleeping hood and take a nap.

- I was not keen on fitness before injury and now I am very keen on fitness.
