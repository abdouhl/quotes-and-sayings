- I have not grown up on movies. I didn't watch much films in my childhood, but I was fond of animation films.
- I don't pick my roles based on what clothes I have to wear. I pick roles because of the character I have to portray, and the public have enjoyed seeing me in those roles.

- My parents have had a love marriage, so I have made it pretty clear to them that I, too, will have a love marriage.
- The audience for 'Lootera' is far less than for my other kind of films. Just because I pulled it off doesn't mean I will change my tastes. I love to watch masala films, and I love to sing, dance and say those larger-than-life dialogues. But whenever I get a chance, and I really feel the connect, I will do a performance-oriented film.
- I don't know what I am doing tomorrow. But I know one thing for sure: the day I stop enjoying my work, I will pack up and leave.
- If you enjoy working with someone, you must work with them. Again and again and again. If you enjoy the atmosphere and your work, why should you stop yourself?
- Luckily, I've had a very good working rapport will all my co-stars. Nobody has complained about me. No one's ever said they don't want to work with me.
- There's really not much that people can pick on me for my work, so obviously they find other reasons to write something bad about me. I mean, people enjoy reading bad stuff about people.
- Coming from a filmy background, I have seen everything growing up, but even at that point of time, it never really fascinated me. I did not like going to my dad's shoots. We were taught not to get carried away with it from a very young age.
- When I watch a film, I watch it as an audience instead of thinking as an actor or an intellectual. I see whether it made me laugh, get involved or shocked me at certain points. Something has to stir inside me.
- I'm eternally grateful for the fact that I'm doing what I like best. I thank my stars for it. I wonder why I wasted all that time being fat. I should have lost weight and started acting earlier. But as they say, things happen when they are meant to.
- Why shouldn't I be confident? I'm well educated, I can deliver a line, and I have more than three expressions. That's good right?
- I will take a back seat when I know my fame is dipping. I'm not delusional.
- Few people know that I am also an artist; I truly enjoy sketching and drawing.
- In this perfect world, there are certain imperfections that catch your eye. That's what works for me. I don't concentrate on being perfect, but instead put that effort behind my craft and being true to myself. I don't conform to pressures outside of me. I am confident about myself.
- Be comfortable; be you. What's most important is to understand what suits your body type and personality. Stick to that, and you can't go wrong!
- I have a pretty active presence on social networking sites, and every day there are messages from so many young girls telling me that they are happy B-Town has curvy women like me. I feel you should be happy the way you are. Of course, fitness is important, but not to the extent of obsession!
- I believe in doing my work quietly and not make a big hullabaloo about it. That is how I operate. I don't see any other reason to be visible for; I like it when people talk about my work - that is what I am here for.
- I like to unwind by doing nothing. If I do get a day, I just like to vegetate and laze around.
- My opinion is that you cannot really blame cinema for the result of what is somebody's mindset. I think it's just entertainment. For me, I've always believed in doing things that I can sit and watch with my family. So far I think I've stuck to that, and I will also in the future.
- Even if my film does well, you will not see me blowing my own trumpet. There is no time to sit and dwell on whether it's done well or not done well.
- I love my job. But I like to have fun at work. So I don't get finicky if one strand of hair is standing out in a shot. I don't get finicky about broken nails. I don't let small things affect me. I'm not perfect. Nobody is. There's no fun in being perfect. I enjoy my work; there's no pressure on me.
- I am aloof by nature. I mind my own business. I'm good with everyone, and I get along fine with people. But work is work, and friendship is friendship. I never mix the two.
- I am the kind of person who hates the gym. I am allergic to the gym. I want to run away from it.
- I didn't intend to even become an actor. I was studying fashion, and I think acting just happened by chance. It really felt more like I was watching a movie from outside, like it was happening to someone else. It's been a great journey so far.
- To be very honest, I cannot drape a saree myself. I have never draped one on my own, ever. But it has been done on me so many times, that now I have memorised all the steps, and if someone challenges me, I will surely be able to do it.
- I've done two remakes, 'Rowdy Rathore' and 'Son of Sardaar,' and I see nothing wrong with it. The originals were in a language that not everyone understands, so when you're making it in another language, you can reach a much wider audience. That's how I look at it.
- So far, yes, I have been doing only commercial films because those are the kind of films that came my way. Those are the kind of films that I liked, but definitely I'm open to doing other kinds of cinema as well, and if something comes along - if I like a character - then I would definitely do something off-beat or edgy.
- I do my work to the best of my capacity. I don't pick a role looking at its length. I take up a film because I would like to see it.
- If a girl is not covered from head to toe, it does not mean she is inviting you to ogle at her. If we are interpreting it that way, it is not the girl, but our upbringing that is to be blamed. It is the thought process that needs to be changed.
- You feel stressed when you think that you are working. When I am doing movies, I don't feel that way at all. When I wake up in the morning and then get dressed up for the job, I feel good because this is what I want. I am the happiest that way and honestly, if at all I get a day or two off, I get restless.
- I believe one doesn't have to shed clothes to look sexy!
- From the time I entered the industry, I have always been clear about certain things - no short clothes, no kissing, no bikinis. Nobody comes to me with such roles. And I have no dearth of work.
- I've never had to fight for a role. Call it my ego or my self-respect, but I won't pick up the phone and call a producer and fight or ask for a role. That's not me. I've always got the best, and my work speaks for itself.
- One thing which I know about this world of glamour is that it is better to have people talking about you than not being talked about at all.
- I never did films for the money or because I needed to buy a house or car. I do it because I love my job.
- I was over-confident while growing up. I think when you look a certain way, you try and compensate by something else. I was always a strong child, was always confident, but looks never mattered to me.
- There are actually no political aspirations. I think you need to have the right attitude and aptitude for it. I don't think I have the right aptitude for it. I think it is unfair to push somebody in that direction just because my father happens to be a politician.
- I am not a very social person and have a few friends who have been with me since school and college. I hate going to parties and events and would rather sit at home and watch TV. Parties are the place where controversies happen.
- Hits and flops will come and go. But what stays with you is the experience you had while shooting a film. I am happy learning something new each time.
- I think I have broken the mould that actresses have to be extremely thin on screen. All those who are making my weight an issue just prove that people are jealous. These are people who have nothing to do in life except to stare at their computer screens and make comments on us.
- My brothers always like to believe that my father pampered me and I am spoilt. While it is not true, they felt that way. As for my dad, I could not do anything wrong. So, if I did something wrong, I would put the blame on them, and he would shout at them.
- My mother gave up her career bringing us up, and she has played a very important role in keeping us grounded. Even now I don't take my work home, my stardom home. It ends where it is supposed to end. There is a life beyond stardom, and it's a very normal life which I cherish. I anyway don't handle attention very well.
- I am not comfortable kissing or exposing, and I believe in laying open my cards well in advance so that no one is inconvenienced. Till date, I have been very specific about certain things, and my directors have always understood my concerns and played along. I don't think this should pose a problem in the future as well.
- I want to be talked about for the films I am doing rather than a party I attended, the dress I wore, and the men I may have met and dated. In any case, by and large I think I have spoken about more for the profession I am in than my personal life. That's the way I like it because frankly, I don't really have a personal life to begin with.
- I want to be a simple bride when I get married. I want a beach wedding where I am running around on the sand in a white dress.
