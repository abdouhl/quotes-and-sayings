- As it is, 'Size Zero' is not for me. I feel a woman should have a feminine figure.
- I think you should allow your kid to know and watch what is dangerous instead of keeping them away from it. Otherwise, how will she or he know that it is unsafe?
- My routine is very simple because I realised that the more complicated the exercise sessions are, the less likely I am to make it for them. They have to be simple and doable in my daily routine.

- I tell women who have gone through cancer that healing from it requires receiving care, receiving support, letting friends and family rally around us. It is time to receive.
- My whole life turned upside down once I became a mother.
- I have fond memories of consuming a handful of almonds that were soaked the previous night and peeled the next morning. All through my school life, my mother would ensure she kept some almonds in my tiffin box so that I would always have my daily dose of nutrition handy.

- If someone would ask me to choose between TV and films, I would go for TV. I am content with it. Also, I have a family and a son to look after. A mother needs to be there with the child.
- Television takes you to an altogether different audience and directly to people's living room. On television, I'm being myself, and that's why people relate to me more.
- I have immense amount of respect for women who leave their kids and go to work because they have to. They don't have a choice. I couldn't have done that.
- I read anything and everything. Comfort food for my brain is fantasy fiction or science fiction.
- I have two full-time jobs: one of a mother and the other of an actor. Both are equally important, and that's why I'm busy 24x7.
- My mother has done a great job with her kids. The daily struggle of raising three daughters with a very limited income yet seeing to it that they get a good upbringing, giving her daughters wings even after not being so educated - that person is my hero.
- There's a hidden Goth in me: I have a dark sense of humour; I have a dark sense of fashion.
- I have endorsed every hair product in my career. Looks have been my bread, butter, jam. Looks are important in our society.
- My parents are naive in their morality of things, and so, without realising it, I landed up being ethical and having strong opinions.
- There are certain images attached to an Indian woman - a mother, daughter, homemaker... there are certain parts of it that I really like, and I love having that identity also, but I feel women shouldn't be limited to that.
- As an actor, there are a lot of personas and personalities that you carry. Whatever you wear, you adapt to it, and people feel that's your style. But that's not necessarily an actor's style. There are some things that are very 'you,' and some are only to suit your persona.

- If I return to films, the feeling to do it must come from the heart.
- Unless you are aggressive, you will never become number one.

- Incorporating small changes/additions in one's daily routine can have a big impact. For example, eating a healthy diet, including a handful of almonds every day and a regular exercise regime, not only helps me maintain a healthy life but also balance both my family's health as well as my own.
- Initially, I was like, 'I can handle anything. What's the big deal about being a mother?' I was not prepared for the changes which are so subtle that they creep up on you.
- When I shaved my hair, my friends asked me to keep it, maybe make my own wig out of it, but I wanted the old hair to go; it was not mine. I wanted to let go.
- I love French cuisine. From crepes to the variety of cheese and seafood preparations, this cuisine is so innovative and fresh. It offers something for every kind of foodie.
- My son can be as open as he wants with me, but he cannot forget I am his mother and that all will not be forgiven.
- I've discovered that being behind the camera is more fascinating. If I had to choose a profession today, it would have been something behind the camera.
- Until Ranveer was born in August 2005, three years into our marriage, I was working in Hindi or South Indian films. After marriage, I began learning how to run a house. My mother wanted to teach me the basics, but I was never home. So when my mother-in-law taught me chores, it was hard to adjust.
- As a writer, penning down personal stuff was not easy for me, as it was way too close to my heart.
- I believe, as human beings, we sometimes indulge in self pity more than it's necessary. Over my life's journey, I have realised that overthinking about your problems and indulging in self-pity is not the answer to get through tough times.
- There is no reason to compare Bollywood and Marathi films. Both have their own charm.
- I feel I should get better at my fitness regimen, but I think it's about doing it more regularly rather than expecting miracles. There are no shortcuts.

- People often confuse self-respect with arrogance. I believe that there is a very thin line between the two. Balance between the two is often what leads to happiness.
- For a formal look, I wear saris, and certain occasions require a dressed up look. But wherever I can, I like being in something easy and casual.
- My mother-in-law thinks I'm more beautiful than all the other faces around. She keeps encouraging me to take up more work.
- I think I've been pretty private as a person. Nobody really knows me.
- As a contemporary Indian woman who has been handling so many things, I think she can be a very strong woman, a very strong working woman. We need more and more working women in our country.
- I would be happy to do 'Sarfarosh 2'. The script should be as good as the first one. I don't want to destroy the goodwill of the first one.
- Comfort is always a priority, but that doesn't mean, just for the sake of comfort, I will wear some silly stuff and make myself look tacky.
- As I started parenting, I realised there is no formula to it.
- My memories of the whirlwind '90s are a blur of work schedules. I was completing my B. Com. degree in 1991 when I took to modelling and acting in TV serials. A year later, I found my foothold in movies.
- For working mothers, creating a work-life balance is critical, as we must ensure we do not neglect any significant part of our lives - our children, our family's health, our own health and fitness, our marriage, and, of course, our careers.
- Marriage is not synonymous to change but a new dimension to life.
- I am a completely self-made person. It's been a tough journey - I learnt on the job, worked 48 hours without sleeping.
- Once you are a parent, everything takes a back seat. It ceases to be a role. It is a reality. Once I had Ranveer, I realised that I was cracking under the pressure and that I cannot be a superwoman. I had to open myself to learning.

- Travelling makes my work more stressful and tiring and leaves me with little spirit for exercise.
- Ranveer was almost three when I began my second stint. I took up TV assignments so that I could have enough time at home. While being 24/7 with my child was amazing and his company stimulating, I missed adult conversations.
- I came from a very middle class Maharashtrian family. It was a big step to get into movies. My family was shocked.
- Why should I limit myself or drive myself towards a woman-centric film. Sometimes, the most interesting role is not that of the protagonist.
- Every cancer is different. The symptoms and treatments are different, and every human body deals with it differently. There are no formulas to it. That, I think, was the biggest takeaway for me.
- I'm so glad that my profession helps me find a balance. I have the luxury to choose between my work and my family. Many women don't. I thank my stars for whatever I have.
- I know people have always seen me in very fitted clothes because that is required and so is done, but personally, I like the deconstructed look.
- Television is on a small screen, inside someone's living room, so you have to grab their attention while they are having dinner or cooking or doing something else.
- Every time I feel fearful of something now, I do it.
- I am a Maharashtrian but was not brought up in Maharashtra, as my father worked in CPWD and was transferred every two years. So I have always been a gypsy. I, therefore, could not make good friends, and it still takes me a long time to form attachments.

- I come from a background where there would be one mirror above the basin that was used by everyone in the house. If you spent more than five minutes in front of the mirror, you would probably get a whack. My mother was so strict that if anyone complimented me for being pretty, she would not encourage that discussion.
- My writing did turn out to be quite intact, as it has all my experiences gathered at one place.

- Getting married and having children is an evolution process, a live social experiment no one is documenting.
- The upbringing my parents gave me has got me through the ups and downs in my life. My parents always believed that children need to be compassionate and caring human beings above anything. I wish and hope the same for my son Ranveer.
- I don't want people to crowd around me and give advice on what I should and shouldn't wear. Style comes naturally to me.
- I land in New York, and next day, we go to the doctor. He looks at everything, and we had sent all our tests, and he says, 'You know, it is fourth stage, and you have 30% chance of survival.'
- I have realised that to ensure my family stays healthy, it is important I stay fit and healthy myself.
