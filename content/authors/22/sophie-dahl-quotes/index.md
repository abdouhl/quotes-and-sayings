- I should be allowed to be voluptuous or scrawny of my own volition, without people going on about it.
- I still don't know what the 'ideal' woman is. Waifs will always be in demand because it's a lot easier to design for straight up and down rather than round curves. This is the reality, unfortunately.
- It was a really lucky childhood and while, yeah, there were bits of darkness, which is known about because my mother has made no bones about her struggle with depression, the overriding memory of it is a very happy, good one.
- When I was a child, I named my rabbit Pancake and my guinea pig Maple Syrup.

- When I began modelling I was completely unprepared for the onslaught of curiosity it carried with it.
- I have always been tall. When I was five, I towered above all the boys in my class, so it is something I have grown up with.

- Because I cook a lot, I wanted to write a recipe book, really incorporating the message that you don't have to starve yourself to be reasonably skinny.

- I've spent a great deal of my life one way or another talking about food or eating food.
- To my detriment I'm quite rosy-visioned about the idea of love. It's slightly embarrassing but it's part of who I am.

- I've got to confess... I do feel slightly like I've been born in the wrong time.
- It is hard finding clothes that fit. At the German Vogue shoot most of the clothes were undone at the back.
- I love sushi.

- Find me a first novel that doesn't have parallels with the author's life.
- I've started to read more factual books, partly because I didn't go to university.
- My relationship with food has always been uncomplicated.

- I know part of nostalgia is romanticising the past, but I love doing things in a slower way, and the glamour of bygone eras.
- It's so easy to fetishise the dead. We rose-tint or villainise them, and so often in the retelling they are saints or sinners, rather than flawed humans muddling along like the rest of us.

- I lived on an ashram in India at 12 and later I was a heroine in a Bollywood movie - I'm not telling you the name because I was terrible.
- When I write about things, it's a lot to do with sense memory. How things smell and taste can bring incredible memories flooding back and transport you in an instant to another time and place.
- I was lucky because my upbringing was so eccentric. It has helped me cope with unreal situations.
- I eat very simple food, really. A lot of it tending towards nursery food.
- Some people get fat when they're miserable; certainly this was true of my teenage self, but as an adult, deliver me a week of extreme stress and misery and watch me disappear.
