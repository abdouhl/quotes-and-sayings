- I definitely don't Google myself, because I get paparazzi'd every day. You're bound to have something happen and someone mean writes something. There's no power. You don't know who they are, and they're behind the computer. Just don't read it.
- I'd actually rather have a talk show in Australia than even America; I hope I do end up with a talk show.
- It's so rewarding being on radio, especially because it's not about what you look like at all. And I love comedy, so it's very exciting.
- My legs are long but my body is too short.
- Let's be honest, I don't think anyone ever wants to settle down in Hollywood - it's a place you go to work. And once you've hit it, you get out of there as soon as you can. It's definitely not a place you want to get married and have kids.
- If I wear bright colors or something, I'll tie all my hair back. I don't want to look too like 'Girls Next Door.'
- I've made some stupid decisions, so I have to be careful. I once said 'no' to a film that was a number-one hit. And 'Date Movie' had the smallest budget of any movie I'd been in, and it went to the top of the box office.
- I don't want to be a reality TV star - that's not for me.
- After two and a half engagements, of course I want to get married and have babies, so I am going to freeze my eggs.
- I am definitely one of those girls who want to get married. I have two sisters and they are both married with kids, and I'm like, 'Oh, I want that.'
- All my success seems to come straight away, and it's not until later that I get to appreciate it. Like with 'Popstars,' I won the competition, and now I look back and go, 'God, I was lucky to have number-one singles and albums.'
- People see me as a person who can make them some money, which makes it hard to make real friends. I'm asked to do a lot of stuff for free - to wear certain clothes, turn up to events - people use you to make money. I think that's why I tend to jump into relationships.
- When I was younger, I was like, 'I want to be on Playboy.' My mum was a Playmate.
- You know all those models who say, 'I was so tall and lanky and everyone picked on me at school' - I was not that girl. I hear that and I'm like, 'Oh, you poor thing!'
- I don't understand anyone thinking I'm sexy at all. I don't get it because, growing up as a kid, I wasn't. I was like a dork, fat, so for me it's really weird. I became famous in Australia when I was 18, and I was still a little bit chubby.
- My family do not think I'm special - not one, one bit.
- I realise having work done makes you look older - and everyone's starting to look the same, which is a problem. I've admitted that I had a cyst removed from my lip and had it filled - I had to; the lip was half gone. And I've tried Botox, but I don't do it any more. I'd tell anyone who's going to have it done not to do it.
