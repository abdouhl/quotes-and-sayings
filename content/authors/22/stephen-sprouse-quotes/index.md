- The photograph, the clothes, the sets - this was about 1974, and I started hanging out with my friend Richard Sold, who was playing in a band with Patti Smith.
- I got to the point where I was sick of fashion again, like I was at the end of high school.
- Then I moved down to the Bowery to this building where Debbie Harry lived. It was there that I started combining some clothes for her and continued doing the art and photography.
- That's how I taught myself how to draw - tracing the ads and petting new clothes on the models.
- I would just sketch everything that was being made for the collections.
- I grew up in Columbus, Indiana, a kind of industrial and farmland place.
- I just really wanted to do art, except when I was taking those photographs of people I would make the clothes that I would photograph them in so I could control the whole thing.
- I guess you just fall into things when to you're supposed to.
- When I went to college, I wasn't interested in fashion anymore - I was interested in art.
- Maybe if they all could he combined - art, rock and fashion. Those were always my favorite things.
- I lived in town until I was eight and then I moved nearer the farmland, so I had a mixture.
- But after the time there I'd had it with fashion again, so I left to go to architecture school in a summer course at Harvard, which didn't last very long.
- I finished high school there and then I went to Rhode Island School of Design.
- I don't know if it's a movement, but the only thing new that's happening is that I think music and art and video and fashion are all kind of thrown into one big ball that's on television, and people see that all the time - you see a fusion of all those things.
- I watched television a little, but I mostly just drew and read magazines.
