- I've got a fetish about motors on sail boats. Sailboats were meant to sail.
- I have no respect for acting where I'm concerned.
- I realize now that it is a serious business requiring honest, hard work. The first time Hollywood was served up to me on a silver platter. I've finally gotten rid of the platter.
- There's nothing wrong with being an actor, if that's what a man wants. But there's everything wrong with achieving an exalted status, simply because one photographs well and is able to handle dialogue put in one's mouth by others.
- I work in pictures when I have to. In 1979 that was one day's work.
- I was navigator on the Gloucester schooner 'Gertrude L. Thebaud' in the International Fisherman's race. That's a big thing in New England - the race, I mean. A Boston newspaper man covered it, and saw me on board. For a long time I wished he hadn't! He wrote a piece saying I ought to be in motion pictures.
- I got stardom too easily. I didn't appreciate the breaks. But that's all behind me now.
- I am an expert in loneliness and have wandered around a great deal.
- You become trapped doing bad movies. And, the thing that makes it difficult to stop making them is that you get good money.
- When I was a kid and getting paid to stand in front of a camera. I used to spend a lot of my time just laughing inside about the whole thing. It wasn't real to me.

- I don't remember even having spoken a piece in Sunday school.
- I don't call myself a writer, much as I'd love to be. An author, maybe - the novel 'Voyage' made $870,000. Writer, no. Nor am I an actor. I was never on the stage.
- Tahiti has always been like a girl. She should be approached with caution, taking plenty of time and be enjoyed. Instead tourists with plenty of money are flinging themselves on the island and destroying the place.
- For us to support the liquidation of a simple life in a large part of the world is not a particularly attractive prospect.

- Tahiti is now completely occupied by materialistic ideas and I think it is wrong.
- I think my opinion of Hollywood must stem from my own, philosophy as a man.
- Audiences may not realize it, but heroes and leading men always depend on their muscles to get out of jams. They don't have to slug a guy in the mouth to solve a problem, but it's always hinted that he can fight like the heavyweight champ if he has to.
- Only when a film comes along that I really believe in like this one will I turn to acting.
- I feel sometimes as though I've never grown up. And that's great, because it means there are still possibilities. Nothing's free. You pay for whatever you get. But that's OK, because you can't be cheated.

- I live and work for the pure enjoyment of being alive.
- All I need is a place to put my things, somewhere to lay a mattress.
- Actually, I wish I did nothing but write. Acting takes a lot of heat off of me monetarily but it puts a lot of beat on me emotionally.
- I've been offered the role of Franklin Roosevelt, and I wouldn't presume to undertake it.
- When they saddle the leading man with violence it makes the characters look weak. If a man is a heroic type he doesn't have to resort to violence. How many successful men in the world have to settle problems with their fists?

- I started at the top and worked my way down.

- The number of fights in movies is haywire.
- If you stop to think, the only films that don't include at least one punch in -the jaw are musical comedies. And even then some of those villains get brained in the middle of an aria.
- It's a presumptuous thing to write one's autobiography, but this is really an effort in the deepest sense to explore the struggle of a tortured individual to be himself in a hostile society.
- As a child I was told if I was ever given ruled paper I should write across the lines. And that's what I've done, traveling the roads with the least traffic.
- I was surprised when they sent me to Hollywood, Then I thought as soon as they discovered my 14 fathom greenness, I'd be out on my ear. But everything kept going.
