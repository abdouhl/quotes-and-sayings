- I don't usually get star struck, but I met Sir Paul McCartney randomly on Sunset Boulevard a few years ago, and I lost it! I couldn't breathe, I couldn't think, and I didn't know how to speak. It was crazy. He was nice enough to talk to my family and me for 10 minutes, but I remember babbling away about nonsense.
- I've always had fun with music, but I prefer to listen to it rather than sing.
- I watch way too many VH1 reality shows like 'I Love Money' and 'Tough Love.'
- I'm definitely a romantic comedy dude because I'm a big romantic at heart. I'm a softy, so it's always nice to watch movies that make you think that love at first sight is actually possible.
- I think I'd be pretty star struck over John Mayer. I'm a big fan of his music, and I think he's great.
- There's this whole new grammar Twitter skill set that I do not possess. I'm not a very good person to follow. I never tweet, and when I do, it's about some sort of sporting event that I'm watching.
