- It should be the pinnacle of any players' career to get to a World Cup Finals with their country.
- What I want is players who are 100 per cent committed.
- I think I worked out in my head it's something like 75 training sessions before you've got them pretty well drilled. You're not going to get that in international football so you're relying on their intelligence and the ability of the players to slot in.
- At Kilmarnock we are all inclusive, there are no divides.
- When I bump into Scotland supporters they are pretty positive. They just want a little bit of success. I don't think that's too much for them to ask.
- The thing is, if nobody points out what's wrong, then nothing will ever be done about it.
- If people are coming in in dribs and drabs, it doesn't look good. You have to have standards and have rules to adhere to. If you have that then it carries on into the training.
- I feel I did a good job at West Brom. It was cut short abruptly, which is something historically that West Brom have done - as you've recently seen with Darren Moore.
- In my time at Kilmarnock, I'm sorry I didn't win you a trophy but I stand here in front of three stands of Kilmarnock supporters - that is my trophy.
- I was happy working on my golf and doing a bit of fishing.
- It is my job to work with the players we have and try to improve them as a team and move the country forward.
- I won't be chasing down players who have retired. I only want players who are 100% committed to Scotland.
- I can assure you I'll be working very hard with the Tartan Army.
- We had a black and white telly in the corner of the room that had three channels. There was nothing to keep you around the house. It was a different time.
- Everyone talks about VAR, which is great. It will help the referees no end. But if you've got VAR in place and VAR becomes the ref, I'm not sure that's good for the game.
- I will miss the day to day stuff because I love coaching. I love being out on the pitch.
- With a club team you do get to work with them day in, day out, for weeks.
- When I was a player back in the 80s, Rangers didn't sign Catholic players. There was an enquiry when Graeme Souness took over about me going to Rangers. At the time I was told I couldn't do that.
- At the end of the day, you want a straightforward, simple system which everyone understands. If you can get clarity and simplicity in any process, it's better for everybody.
- My dad has even less emotion than me!
- I feel unfulfilled in England. I think I'm a decent manager and a very good coach. I've still got a lot to offer some club who will maybe take a chance on me.
- I want to make the Tartan Army happy and qualify for a major tournament. That's the goal.
- Scottish football has always been about Celtic and Rangers, but we've rattled some cages and that's been good. The more competition they have, the better for Scotland as a whole.
- It's lovely being back in the west of Scotland, really nice.
- It remains an ambiton of mine to get to a major finals with Scotland.
- My father was my No.1 influence, long before him actually being involved with my youth team.
- At times, you have to maybe speak out of turn or say a little bit too much which upsets a few people.
- I was no different to any other kid of my generation. I played with my mates in the park every day, every spare minute I could.
- It's important not to get hung up on the notion that everyone who has an injury is trying to dodge it.
- In football you tend to drift away and on to the next job; you bump into someone after two or three years and it's the same as seeing them yesterday.
- I don't shout from the rooftops or blow my own trumpet. But I take a lot of satisfaction from the players and staff at clubs who recognise what I've done.
- If you are playing at home to Cyprus you have to be on the front foot. You have to get the crowd onside, get at them, create chances and keep the back door closed so you don't lose any silly goals when you are on top in a game.
- I have to get used to international management. The players will go back to their clubs, they will all be playing at the weekend, they will all be thinking about other things.
- A burning ambition of mine is to take Scotland to a major tournament. It should be the pinnacle of any players' career to get to a World Cup finals with their country.
- When I was little I got to dribble the ball around while my older brother Paul, who played for a long time for Kilmarnock, my dad and my uncle Jimmy - who was at Celtic as a kid and played with Morton and Cambridge City - kicked it hard and I got punted out the way. But gradually I got allowed into the game.
- You know when you take a manager's job it could be terminal. I was making sure there was enough in the bank to cover that, making sure myself and my family would be all right when I took the plunge.
