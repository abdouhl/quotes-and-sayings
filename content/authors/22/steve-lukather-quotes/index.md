- I worked with George Harrison - who was the reason I started playing guitar.

- When you're young, you can burn the candle at both ends, and you're fine.
- There's no such thing as a lead singer in our band.
- I did grow up with Michael Landau, my brother since we were 12 years old. That was competition but in the best way. He is such a monster, always was, and we had a blast growing up playing in bands and early recording and are still the best of pals.

- I worked with Paul McCartney, and he was lovely.

- I've had a lot of self-esteem issues.
- I can hear the youthfulness of my playing on, say, 'Hold The Line.'
- A great solo does not make a great piece. Rather, a great solo in a great song - that's what makes a 10 out of 10. It's the combination of emotional feel and inventive ideas.
- Especially early on, I had no idea what I was going to be asked to do when I walked into a studio. I was doing 26 sessions a week - all day, all night.

- I'm a weird guy with a weird sense of humor.
- I have been using small teardrop jazz picks since I was, like, 14.
- We have always been like The Eagles and Fleetwood Mac in that we have numerous lead singers.
- As a session player for so many years, I have found myself in rooms looking around going, 'Is this for real?'
- Being out of tune sucks.
- In sports, stats count. Music? Not so much.
- I play keyboards and have played on many a Toto record.
- Gear not working on a live show - that is rough.
- In sixth grade I had a band called The Blueberry Waterfall. I had borrowed a guy's Fender Jaguar and Boss Tone Fuzz, which you plugged straight into a Blackface Twin. It was a little power trio - we were actually pretty good for our age.
- Fans are always in for a treat when they see us in person.
- That's all that matters in music: fun.
- To me, our signature song was 'Rosanna.' That was the ultimate Toto track, where everybody had a chance to shine.
- When the Beatles were on 'Ed Sullivan,' life went from black and white to color like in 'The Wizard of Oz' - and the irony I'm in the band Toto is not lost on me.

- My band did the Teenage Fair battle of the bands - problem was we were 11 years old! They gave us a prize for youngest band ever.
- I can't sight-read classical etudes - I would have to see it and learn it. But yeah, I can read. It is a wonderful tool. It's like speaking another language. Anyone that says reading music can hurt your playing is either stupid, lazy, or ignorant.
- I listen to Miles Davis and Slipknot.
- When a new record came out, the world would stop that day, and we would sit in somebody's house - whoever had the best stereo system - and sit in the middle of the two speakers and listen and discuss and listen again and go over the album notes and get out the guitar and start playing it and discuss and play some more.
- Vocally and stylistically, we'd have different kinds of songs come on the radio, and people didn't realize it was the same band. A lot of the time, a casual fan would come see us and go, 'I didn't know that you guys did that song. I didn't know that was you!' That was us!
- 'Rosanna' was the hit, but 'Africa' resonated with everyone who heard it.
- I ain't the greatest thing since sliced bread, but I've dedicated my life to music since I was 7 and my dad bought me a guitar and the 'Meet the Beatles' album.
- I just think that there is something that keeps us together, to keep doing what we're doing. I can't really put my finger on it other than each record is like a little snapshot of my life at that particular moment, the way I play, the way I sound, the way I wrote, the way I sing, I can hear it.
- We were never the trendiest band, but we've always been here.
- We always felt it helped during live shows to have multiple lead singers to give our voices a break.
- We've had to develop a super-thick skin. We've been beaten up more than any band in history.

- There are so many myths about us.
- If someone sees me with what looks like a beer, it's always zero per cent.
- I love to create and play, I can't stop, hahaha!
- Y'know, it's funny: I didn't think I'd be playing 'Hold The Line' at 60 years old. I was 19 when I first played that.
- I'm always writing music.
- When I was starting my journey as a young guitar player, I was listening to The Beatles, the Stones, and all the British invasion bands, Top 40, Motown, and all the great music of the '60s. Then the alien ship landed, and life changed again forever... Jimi Hendrix.
- I think, as you get older, you reflect at the silliness of your youth and the stupidity of some of the decisions that were made, and the ego and whatnot, or whatever played into it.
- In the '60s, people had diverse tastes, which made the musical climate that much better and more interesting.
- I read a lot of biographies, and so much is just so boring or so, like, 'Why did you say that?'
- I was doing our first album when I was 19. It came out as a hit, and I blinked - then 37 years went by. There's a lot of stuff that happened in there, but once the snowball started going down the hill, I took the ride.
- I thought that you had to work, work, work and try to be the best musician you could, and that's the only way you could make it. Then it turns out, halfway through the scene, they change the rules on you!
- A lot of festivals on a worldwide basis that I am seeing, they're trying to multi-genre it. Like, they put a wild card band on, like, us old guys that happen to have a record that has stayed in pop culture for as long as it has.
- Our music is harder to play than it sounds. It's the small details you don't realize are there until you try and re-do it.
- I've got the coolest job in the world.
- We were just a high school band that loved music, you know?
- I wish I had perfect pitch, but I don't, and thanks to the miracle of YouTube, a bad night lives forever!
- There's nobody like us in rock history. I'm not saying we're the greatest band in the world - that would be ridiculous.
- Playing live is one thing. Playing under a microscope is another.
- God bless classic rock. It's been very good to me; I'll tell you that.
- That's the thing, though: It doesn't matter how much you've done or who you've played with. Do you have the passion?
- I played all the guitar parts except the guitar solo on 'Beat It.'
- I got caught up in 35 years of Saturday nights. Every night was like party night to me. As a young man, you can do that; it's OK to be an idiot. But I woke up one day, and I realized that 35 years had gone by.
- The Beatles are the 'on switch' to my life.
- There's not an anti-Toto spray that will keep us down.
- I don't believe that heavy strings make it all that much bigger-sounding. If anything, it can mess up your fingers, and you can get tendonitis, which is not cool.
- Self-deprecation is my game.
- Music was everything. Now it is just not as important as it used to be. When I was growing up, where everyone was trying to outdo each other by being more outrageous and sounding more different, now there is a homogeneous sameness to it all.
- My son is a professional musician now.
- I'm no musical snob.
- I get up now at 5:30 in the morning. I practice the guitar for a couple of hours - I do that before I even start my day.
- If it wasn't for the Porcaro brothers, I don't know where I'd be right now. My life would be completely different.
- If it wasn't for Boz, my life would've changed. Meeting the Porcaro brothers and getting that Boz Scaggs gig were two life-changing events for me. It all fell into place after that.
- There is no one like Toto in history in that we were both successful as session musicians and also had a band that sold so many million records.
- MTV ruined music for us.
- Nobody loves everybody.
- Everyone I know, including myself, has missed or lost an audition.
- I was a good father. I was a nice guy, pretty good guitar player, and funny as hell.
- We've become an underground thing for kids, because we never got the love our peers got back in the day. Kids are loving discovering us, and I'm happy to be that band.
- I was asked to be in Elton John's band, Joni Mitchell's band, and Miles Davis' band. I couldn't do it.
- The greatest feeling in the world is performing and connecting with the audience.
- There's so many players that I love and admire. Joe Satriani, Steve Vai, John Petrucci, Mike Landau, Robben Ford, Lee Ritenour, Jay Graydon, John Scofield, Warren Haynes - the list goes on and on.
- I got four kids.
- When the 'Thriller' album came up, we all knew that was going to be the cool record.
- What happens is people go, 'I want to play the guitar,' and the first thing they do is hit Google: 'How can I play this?' and the next thing you know, you've learned all these tricks, but you've never learned how to play rhythm guitar with a groove.
- When people make fun of us, it's fine. I get it.
