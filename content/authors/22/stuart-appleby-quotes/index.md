- America has given me everything Australia couldn't. I grew up on a dairy farm. Now I live in Isleworth, a gated community in Orlando with Tiger Woods down the street.
- The Masters is a very important tournament. You don't want to jeopardize your chances. The sponsors understand that.
- I don't know where 12 months has gone.
- In America, if you want to make it as a golfer, you go to college on a scholarship. In Australia, you go to the airport with a plane ticket. The competition just isn't there.
