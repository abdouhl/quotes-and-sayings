- Kolkata is a musical city. What I like about people here is the lack of diplomacy. Some of the best Indian classical musicians belong to this place. Kolkatans do not go by fashion, but by passion.
- I'm blessed to be working with wizards like Vishal Bhardwaj as well as many young composers.
- Frankly, I'm not religious, but I believe in the cause of humanity - doing good work.
- I came across a lot of young composers who have got passion but lack experience. I want to help them out.
- I have declared that I will work free of cost with those composers who are passionate about their work. Sohail Sen is one such lad, whose music in Banjaara has been liked a lot.
