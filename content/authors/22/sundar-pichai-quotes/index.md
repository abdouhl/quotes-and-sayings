- We do have business relationships; we do licensing relationships, and people want to use Google services on top of Android. But in theory, you can use Android without Google.
- I would love for my phone to scream if I am about to miss an important thing in my life and never bother me if I'm doing something very important and the information coming in is less important than what I'm doing.
- For people who use Google Wallet, the experience works.
- Open platforms historically undergo a lot of scrutiny, but there are a lot of advantages to having an open source platform from a security standpoint.
- The thing which attracted me to Google and to the Internet in general is that it's a great equalizer.

- Android was intended to be very customizable. And we welcome innovations.
- We ship a new version of Google Play Services every six weeks. Typically, 90 percent of users are on the new version of that.

- You're going to have 100s of millions of users on Chrome, spanning mobile, tablets, and desktops. That is one unfragmented base. That uniformity is probably better than most of the issues across browsers.

- Google teams have lots of autonomy, including from people like me.

- We're excited by the success of WhatsApp on top of Android. Amazon brings services like Kindle on top of Android. It's a competitive world and a lot more complex than people realize. When you run a platform on scale, you have to make sure it's truly open. That way, not only do you do well, so do others.

- My dad and mom did what a lot of parents did at the time. They sacrificed a lot of their life and used a lot of their disposable income to make sure their children were educated.
- We have seen a lot of interest from Chinese developers on Google Play because the extent to which Android is used. If we can figure out a model by which we can serve those users, it would be a privilege to do so. So I don't think of China as a black hole.
- If we are building something that users need, and there is a lot of value we are driving, I think how search manifests in iOS will work out just fine.
- A lot of credit goes to Google TV for helping that process get started and helping to build something like Chromecast.
- There are different usage patterns - I never do email during the day. I don't multitask well at all. I don't know how to be in a meeting and participate and be on email at the same time. I do see some people do it more effectively. I've never quite figured that out.
- If you step back and take a holistic look, I think any reasonable person would say Android is innovating at a pretty fast pace and getting it to users.
- Obviously, you will always see more malware targeting Android because Android is used more than any smartphone platform by a pretty substantial difference.

- There are many powerful men and women in mobile. I'm fortunate to be part of that group. By no means do I think I'm the most powerful person.
- Should kids check phones at dinner? I don't know. To me, that's a parenting choice.
- We run Android in a very open way and work closely with all partners. We work with Samsung, and I spend a lot of time with them. But we've always supported other partners.
- Android is one of the most open systems I've ever seen. What makes Android great is it's literally designed from the ground up to be customised in a very powerful way.
- Google search was important - one of the most important applications ever on the Web. People accessed everything through a browser, and for us it was important for making sure we had an option there.
- The impact of giving someone a connected smartphone is no different from giving them a real computer. I look at how my kids learn and how different it is from how I learned because the impact of these things is just so huge. Sometimes I think we don't fully internalize what it is to get the power of knowledge in everyone's hand.
- If I'm about to forget my kid's birthday, I want the phone to scream at me until I do something about it.
- The right moral compass is trying hard to think about what customers want.
- India has long been an exporter of talent to tech companies... But it is India that's now undergoing its own revolution.

- Good companies do whatever it takes to make sure apps are great and don't hesitate to add features.
- We don't expect Google as a first party service to provide all the answers. Part of the reason a platform is successful is because there are very very important things from other companies and other developers on top of the platform.
- We need to bring Android and Chrome to every screen that matters for users, which is why we focused on phone, wearables, car, television, laptops, and even your workplace.
- Google is all about information. So the notion of using and presenting information in the right point at the right time to users is what, in essence, describes Google.
- For me, it matters that we drive technology as an equalizing force, as an enabler for everyone around the world. Which is why I do want Google to see, push, and invest more in making sure computing is more accessible, connectivity is more accessible.
- There's an evolution from, today we tell computers to do stuff for us, to where computers can actually do stuff for us. For example, if I go and pick up my kids, it would be good for my car to be aware that my kids have entered the car and change the music to something that's appropriate for them.
- Android phones in China are more 'Android open source' rather than Android in the way we are all used to here. So a lot of phones don't have Google Play, etc.
- I think it is going to be hard for individual OEMs to create a platform on top of which people will write content and services and which users will transact.
