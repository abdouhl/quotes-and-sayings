- The uneven bars make me especially nervous because when you stop training, you lose sense of where the bar is going to be.
- I focus more on bars and beam just because those are my strongest events, and I just try and maintain whatever I can do on floor and vault. I'm consistently training on all events.
- It's just I spend more time on bars and beam. I obviously want to perfect those and get those to be the best that I can be because those are going to be my strongest events and the two events that I could contribute to the team.
- When I'm scared of hurting myself, I start to overthink things and won't go for it.
- For me, I know that people always expect me to be perfect, so when I'm not perfect, it's really frustrating. I'm really hard on myself and want things to work out right away.
- I've talked to Simone Biles a lot, and it's really nice to get to know her in this way because she was my idol and I used to see her as this intimidating gold medalist, but now she's a friend.
- I didn't even think that I could be competing for a gold medal; I was convinced I'd compete for a silver medal.
- I realized that I could actually miss practice and rest, then come back to the gym and still have my skills.
- I knew the coronavirus was a real thing, but it really hit home when my aunt died, and it was really hard to watch my mom go through that with her sister.
- After you take time off, it can be really scary to do the harder things you used to do, and I personally hate being scared.
