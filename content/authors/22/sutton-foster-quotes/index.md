- I try to have a very optimistic outlook on life. I try not to take anything too seriously. I try to - and I do - find a ton of joy and happiness in my life, and I think that helps you stay youthful.
- I'd had the theater background for so long that I know that world inside out; I just didn't know the pace of how a TV set works, like how a show shoots.
- I've done some TV and I've done a lot of theater, obviously, and the last character I played on Broadway was a very fast-talking broad. I'm used to learning material and words.
- I only tweet about food and silly things, but it's really fascinating because I get a lot of response on Twitter, and I'm always looking at the type of people who write me on there, and it is such a variety.

Without knowing why you're singing or what you're singing about, it's just noise. And without knowing why you're moving your body, it's just flailing of arms.
- I'm used to working hard. Theater can be very grueling, and that's all I've ever known. It's what I've done for 20 years, which is crazy.

- I was so grateful to work on 'Bunheads.' We had so much material, and everything was so rapid-fire, and I developed - through theater too, I developed a really great work ethic. I think preparing for both of them is just that - you come to set ready to go, ready to play. You know your lines. You're ready to work.
- So I'm studying ballet every day and really training so people will see me as a ballet dancer, which no one's seen before.
- I'm a T-shirts, sweatpants, and jeans kind of gal; I dress really simply and comfortably. But one of the things I love about being an actor is that I get to wear amazing costumes.
- I think everybody has something that takes them away or makes them happier. To some people it's baseball or sports or knitting or the movies.

- I'm a fan of originals and classics, but I'm also a fan of new ideas.
- I'm single. I just moved to a new city. I'm sort of starting over. I'm in Los Angeles. I don't really know what my life is right now. It's not what I thought it'd be at 37, and I think a lot of people can relate to that.

- Coming from the theatre, I have played some fabulous characters where I get to wear gowns, and I get to be a princess or someone from the 1920s, or I get to wear showgirl costumes. I'm used to wearing a wardrobe that changes how I feel. It's a bit of an outside-in approach - so often, the clothing can reveal so much about a character.
