- I wasn't trying to fit into a thing... it was not like I was like, 'Right, I'm the Han; I'm the Leia; I'm the Luke.' I was just like, 'Okay, I'm Rey, just trying to do me, just trying to do this scene, trying to do the right thing,' and I think that was a huge advantage because I think if not, it would've been a very different thing.
- It's funny because the action figures are cool, and then I enjoy the magazines because that's me. Obviously, the fans are wonderful - they're so excited - but I'm not Rey, and people tend to not be able to differentiate the two.
- I love to come to L.A. to visit, and then I like to come to rainy old London because it's home.
- I can tell you that Rey is an incredibly brave young woman who starts off alone and encounters Finn, and they go on an amazing adventure, and she makes relationships she never could have imagined, and she sees things she never could have imagined.
- Rey is so strong. She's cool and smart and she can look after herself. Young girls can look at her and know that they can wear trousers if they want to. That they don't have to show off their bodies.
- The thing about 'Star Wars' is that every single person is important. Even though Rey is a big role, everyone influences everyone. If that wasn't so, why would so many people remember Admiral Ackbar?
- So many people look up to Jennifer Lawrence playing Katniss in 'The Hunger Games.' For them to look up to Rey and what she represents would be fantastic. She's a wonderful character... The reason I love her so much is she does all the fun stuff. She fights, runs and protects herself and has an incredible emotional story.
- My film knowledge is pretty shocking. I'm trying to correct that.
- I can knit quite well. I make really long scarves.
- I don't know if I can prepare for what's to come because I don't know what will.
- I was actually sacked from my first job. It was at a workshop for a short film this poet had written, about when she used to work in a strip club. After the first week, I was told not to come back.
- I've never been one for crushing on famous people.
- I auditioned for this agency. I got an advertisement first, and then something else, which I got fired from. It was soul-destroying. And then the next thing I got, I thought was going to be my big break, and they cut the role. It was only the year that I started auditioning for 'Star Wars' when I really started getting roles.
- My great uncle was in 'Dad's Army.' And I don't know if Americans will know that. It was a hugely popular show in England.
- Rey's parents left her at 5, and we meet her when she's late teens or early 20s, and for someone to keep hopeful that there's a better life to come, I think, is astounding. Though she starts off alone, she very much finds her place in a group of people, and that's lovely.
- Hope makes people good, a lot of the time. You hope for a brighter future, and resentment is outweighed.
- I actually wanted to be a zookeeper when I was 5.
- Carey Mulligan and Felicity Jones are two of my favorites. I'm not so much younger than them. I like that. It's kind of aspirational.
- I liked 'Star Wars,' but I wasn't an uberfan like many people are.
- Maybe I should pretend like I'm not insecure, but I really am. This movie is going to come out and... will people like it? Will they like Rey?
- It became my solace. Because it's the only thing structured in my life right now. Training is sort of a therapy session, I guess.
- I was kind of loathe to go on social media. I find the trolling unacceptable, and I never wanted to look like I was someone who would accept that.
- It's one thing for other people to see potential in you, and it's quite another for you to understand that and see it in yourself.
- When I feel comfortable, I just like to sing and hum, and I don't even know I'm doing it. But sometimes someone will come over to me like, 'I love that song you were singing, but it's distracting.'
- I love Felicity Jones. It was funny because I went to go see the 'Rogue One' set, and I was like, 'Oh my God, I love you.' And she's so tiny, and elegant, and she's just so small. Everyone's so much smaller than they seem.
- I went to a school called Tring Park School for the Performing Arts. I went because initially I was very naughty, and my mom thought if I was busy, I'd be better. And I didn't really do acting until later on in the school, with an amazing teacher. I left, went traveling, came back.
- What we've seen of Rey, she looks like she can handle her stuff. So most of the comments I get are from parents who say how wonderful it is that their little girls can see this character.
- Sadly, people think a guy and a girl can't be friends without something romantic going on.
- Both my parents are creative. My dad did act when he was younger, but they're both very creative.
- Your life goes on, and then your life goes on plus 'Star Wars.' It's just been an incredible time.
- Goals are ever-changing. I didn't set out to be in a 'Star Wars' film but now I've been in one.
