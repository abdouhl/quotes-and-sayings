- I mean, it's been quite busy, especially with the rain delay the first few days, and then having to play the late evenings, waiting here every day. It's been kind of difficult.
- Well, I like to - the game of serve and volley, but it's very tough, you know, against the best players because they return so good and their passing shots are really good. So it's really tough to get there with those players.

- That's what I've been always saying, that I was always using the mixed doubles especially to improve my net game and being able to return a guy's serve, 'cause then when you play someone like Serena, you are little bit more prepared for that.
- Yeah, I think there are many other important things in life, not just tennis.
- But just maybe sometimes being even more patient. Even though I thought I did that much better this year, and sometimes, you know, make my opponents play that one extra ball, and just knowing how to play the big points better.
