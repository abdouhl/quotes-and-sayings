- You cannot train saving with your feet, but sometimes it is instinct. Sometimes it is quicker to go with the feet; going with the hands is sometimes more difficult. Even when I was young, I would go with my feet, it's something good for me.

- The biggest thing for me is that I've managed to work through some difficult times, and those moments always make you stronger. It makes you a stronger person and a better player.
- The style is the same at all levels, which facilitates things: bring the ball out from the back, keep possession, work gaps to create chances. It's like that from the Under-15s all the way through. That's the Spanish way, and it has triumphed.
