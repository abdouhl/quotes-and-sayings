- My daughter does sewing, needlepoint and very good drawings. My son plays the piano.

- There was a time when craft used to mean anything but the considered, stylish or academic. It was a term of derision. The 'craft fair' on the village green was to be avoided.
- We are a modern family who need to live in a certain way.
- There's a real hunger to understand where objects come from, how artists show their understanding of materials. And there's something fascinating about watching people work, whether it's someone engraving a gun or sewing beautiful clothes together. I know that myself; I'll make a piece of furniture and feel the wood's grain talking to me.
- Usually, when people think of marquetry, they think of Dutch 17th-century furniture with inlaid flowers and jugs. Our goal is to break down the barriers between old and new, to combine traditional marquetry techniques with a modern idiom.

- We are no longer teaching young people to make things that are beautiful and of very high quality. We are not giving them the chance to learn how to create artefacts to a high standard of design and workmanship.
- Design is important. I spend much of my working life as a designer. But how can you design for materials if you don't know what they can do? The feel of them, the possibilities, the capabilities? These are things you learn only by working with materials all the time. Frankly, a university degree is not much help in that.
- We are not training crafts people as we used to do. We're not giving people the chance to learn. Education has become very academic. There's nothing wrong with academic for some people, but not all.

- For the novice furniture collector, buying antiques can seem a rather daunting prospect. Nobody wants to feel that they may not make a wise choice and that ultimately they could be throwing their money away.

- The best ideas come from sitting down with a piece of paper and a pencil.
- If you cut me open, you would find bits of me looking at things with an aesthetic eye, also with a historical eye. But mostly at the way things have transported themselves through time.
- My teaching was primarily focused on making, it wasn't about the pounds, shillings and pence. I remember being in college and being in business and there was just a weekend in between.
- My father's rooms, as a child, were a very exciting place to be.

- I started off by doing everything myself, driving the truck, going to the woodshop, buying the wood, designing the furniture, cutting it out, making it myself, finishing it, polishing it, and delivering it, and writing the invoice and writing the letters, doing the books, doing the telephone bill and everything else like that.

- I'll never forget the moment in 1985 when I was riding my motorbike down the King's Road and I first saw the words David Linley on the sign on my first shop. I nearly came off my bike.
