- I was a team captain, I was the guy for the first couple years. And then all of the sudden I was just the backup. It wasn't easy. I think it would be easy to bow my head and feel sorry for myself, but I knew as a captain I had to be a great teammate.

- I'm not overlooked by NFL teams. That's the only thing I really care about.
