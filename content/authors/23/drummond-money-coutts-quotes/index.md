- I think there's a huge amount of magic on television, which is slightly vapid: there's no real meaning or message behind it; it is simply a trick.
- Ten years ago, TV cookery shows were about a man or a woman following recipes. Now, it's all about journeys and campaigns and less about the actual chopping and dicing. That's what I'd like to do with magic.
- I think that magic, at its root, is a very abstract notion. There's no real, approved definition. And, in that sense, it's like love; you can only see magic by the effect it has on people.
- I arrived at school pensive, introverted, and not very sporty, so magic became a place of mystery and intrigue, an escape for my boyish mind.
- I would like to do things like I did in Tanzania, going somewhere and exploring a theme and investigating as well as performing for those people.
- Magic, historically, has been a man doing tricks with no wider story behind it.
- Being able to elicit the feeling of the unfathomable in intelligent adults is like falling in love.
- I've never categorically been a banker. I had two internships while I was at university. The decision was more banking, or magic, and I went with the latter.
- Magic touches people in the way great art does. It lets them see the world with new eyes.
- From a young age I was obsessed with the mysterious, the esoteric, the paranormal.
- I would wish eventually to be able to make television that informs and educates as well as entertains.
