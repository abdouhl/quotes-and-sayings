quotes = ['''We must never take the public's trust for granted - our predecessors worked hard to earn it, and it is our responsibility to continually earn that trust.''' ,'''At the Department of Justice, our ability to fulfill our responsibilities - to advocate for victims, to vigorously pursue misconduct, to seek justice in all its forms - depends on public confidence in the institutions we represent.''' ,'''I believe the attorney general or the deputy attorney general has an obligation to follow the law and the Constitution and to give their independent legal advice to the President.''' ,'''It's really important to me that the public have confidence in their criminal justice system. We don't operate very well if the public doesn't trust us.''' ,'''At D.O.J., we don't want to go after the corporate wrongdoers simply as an end unto itself; we want to decrease the amount of corporate wrongdoing that happens in the first place. We want to restore and help protect the corporate culture of responsibility.''' ,'''Restoring a person's ability to achieve success when they leave the prison walls promotes public safety, builds our economy and, most importantly, is the right thing to do.''' ,'''Certainly, I don't think I can ever be accused of being soft on crime.''' ,'''Americans should never believe, even incorrectly, that one's criminal activity will go unpunished simply because it was committed on behalf of a corporation.''' ,'''Holding individuals accountable for corporate wrongdoing isn't ideological; it's good law enforcement.''' ,'''The federal prison population increased by almost 800 percent between 1980 and 2013, often at a far faster rate than the Bureau of Prisons could accommodate in their own facilities.''' ,'''There is one system of justice, demanding that all be held accountable when laws are broken.''' ,'''As I've seen over and over again during my career, the best way to deter individual conduct is the threat of going to jail. That's what truly changes behavior. That's what changes the calculus as employees and executives decide whether to participate in an illegal scheme.''' ,'''At the Justice Department, we have no greater obligation than ensuring all people are treated equally under the law, and Americans must know that we will vigorously pursue criminal activity regardless of whether the crime is committed on a street corner or in a corner office.''' ,'''At the risk of sounding really corny now, I'm a career prosecutor. I've been doing this for a very long time. And I believe in holding people responsible when they violate the law. But our sole responsibility is to seek justice. And sometimes that means a very lengthy sentence for people who are dangerous and from which society must be protected.''' ,'''The damage caused by corruption is just as real in Angola and Azerbaijan as it is in Atlanta and Albuquerque, and it's our obligation to advance the rule of law wherever our laws apply.''' ,'''My responsibility is to ensure that the position of the Department of Justice is not only legally defensible, but is informed by our best view of what the law is after consideration of all the facts.''' ,]
