- The more goals you concede ultimately results in the bottom three, not the more goals you score.

- Busquets has been a great player for Spain and Barcelona, don't get me wrong. He's a very effective player and is the first pick for every manager because he plays such a simple game. But we laud him as a genius, whereas our own we don't, we criticise.
- I always like working with young people, it keeps you young.

- Have transfer prices in England surprised me? No. Are the prices over-inflated? Yes. But there is no surprise now.
- Busquets is a sitting midfield player who breaks up play, intercepts, passes it very quickly and is intelligent. That's what he is. He's not much more than that, but he gets a lot of praise for it. Whereas Eric Dier does a similar job, but sometimes gets loads of criticism for it.
- If you're talking about English football very few teams play 4-4-2 now: it's either 4-4-1-1, 4-3-3 or 4-2-3-1, they are the three major systems played throughout the Premier League.
- Your cruciate ligament, like many long-term injuries... when they come back they're expected to be what they were before the injury. While fit it sometimes takes a little bit longer for some than others.
- It's difficult in your life when both parents pass so quickly and you're not really that old when they move on. There is a big gap in your life. There's a hole. You learn to live with it but never forget it.

- Teams with limited budgets will always find times tough and results won't always go your way.
- People too often - because it's an easy, lazy tag - dwell on my style of football.
- Arsene has most of the media in his pocket now and is almost - almost - affecting the officials so that you can't tackle an Arsenal player. That's something he's very clever at working on and it's almost working in his favour, you can see that.
- The problem for me is we are denying British coaches positions in all divisions now, particularly in the top division and the Championship. We need to do something about that. As a country, as the FA, as the Premier League, we need to protect the position of our own highly qualified coaches who are not even getting an interview now.
- If I got sacked because my results weren't good enough at Everton, I accept it, but getting sacked when they finish eighth, it is ridiculous. In fact, it is ludicrous.
- It's great having the best league in the world, no doubt about that, but the downside of that is the national team will suffer.
- I don't have to prove a point to anybody. The only thing I do is continue to do my job and all the outside press can do and say what they want to because that's their right and their industry.
- It's always a good time to play against a team when they come back from Europe, whether it's the Europa League or Champions League.

- Man-management is my biggest asset, to help the players enjoy themselves and be better than they already are.
- We live in a world that builds people's expectations so high, so when the downside comes there is a knee-jerk reaction.
- Most young talented players I worked with over many, many years who I've met later have said, 'Oh, I wish I'd listened to you.' When you meet them later in life they regret not taking the opportunity with the talent they had.
- It's never just about talent, it's about a lot more than that.
- People seem to expect when that happens, for players to be brought in that are so much better than the ones that have left. In the end they might be better but in the beginning they might be worse. Because they all have to gel and get to know each other and get to know you.
- I'm not suited to Bolton or Blackburn, I would be more suited to Inter or Real Madrid. It wouldn't be a problem to me to go and manage those clubs because I would win the double or the league every time. Give me Manchester United or Chelsea and I would do the same, it wouldn't be a problem.
- I've worked at St James' and in the first game of the season there the fans will lift the players.
- I have always said that managers stay in a job when they win football matches.

- My parents are from Scotland and my sister and brother were both born in Scotland so my heritage is from there.
- For the record, I've never taken a bung in my life. I might have enjoyed a meal or a bottle of wine on an agent or two but that is it. I was earning Â£1.5m a year, so I didn't need a little bit extra from an agent. It would have been madness.

- There's always going to be a time when there's a difficult period and my responsibility is to manage the players through that. You have to make sure you bring stability back to the club and get where you want to be.
- I think that the problem for any player you want to select for England, not just in isolation, is that it'll be a concern if that player doesn't play for his team.

- I am very shocked and disappointed to be leaving Blackburn Rovers. I am extremely proud to have managed this club and I enjoyed a fantastic relationship with the players, my staff and the supporters during my time in charge.
- The type of football I played at Everton, the fans said it wasn't good enough and I would say the same - I knew it wasn't good enough for Everton - but I knew I had to get them in the position where they were safe.

- When does every fan like the manager?
- Now astronomical wages are making it very difficult to take somebody who might not even have a transfer fee attached to them, because of the net value that they want and the net value that they're worth.
- To say we have to play a certain way, or try to, every game is great in theory, but depending what players you have got you have to play to their strengths and cover up their weaknesses.
- Football is a worldwide business consortium and to satisfy that best you need to find the best players.
- Any football club that is any good is down to the manager more than anything else.

- I want to be able to savour life while I'm still relatively young and when I'm still relatively healthy enough to do all the things I want to do, like travel, spend more time with my family and grandchildren without the huge pressure that comes with being a football manager.
- As much as I liked Wolves as a boy and it was a childhood dream to play and perhaps manage for the club, I've come to Bolton and this is where I want to stay.
- I have to remind Arsene about his team, which used to win the league, that was the dirtiest team in the league. If you cast your mind back to when they were winning the league, they had more seedings-off and bookings than anyone else.
- A quality player is a quality player.
- When will the first manager manage at a professional level having learned his trade on 'FIFA 16,' '17,' or '18?' I've watched my grandson on it, I've watched him buy players and sell them to get to the top of the league and it's teaching him how to manage. The knowledge base that they build up would be very interesting down the line.
- Everybody walks around talking about, 'Sam Allardyce's style is not good enough, he doesn't play the right way' and so on and so forth and it is a massive problem for me. People believe it. You believe the false lies, the false implications. Football does that - it believes that lie sometimes.
- Far too much emphasis on what is deemed the 'wrong' style of football. That's what annoys me. Your style depends on who you're playing and what group of players you have at your disposal.
- Whoever you are playing and whatever you are playing against you have to weigh up tactically how you approach that game. That has always been a part of my make-up, having made my way through every division and finding out what management is all about.
- The England team shouldn't be picked on whichever players are in the Premier League when you've got a Premier League player playing in the Championship.

- As a manager, you look at who is going to get the fans on the edge of the seats.
- My confidence is in myself and how I run a football club and I've been doing that for many, many years now.
- If a player digests his own statistical information in his own time, on his own laptop, tablet or whatever, without a coach standing over him, it makes it easier for him. It helps with the pressure. There's a fear factor but spending time at home analysing things can help control it.
- Since Newcastle I've had a fantastic time at Blackburn and then here, at West Ham.
- Believe me, I look back on West Ham in a good way.
