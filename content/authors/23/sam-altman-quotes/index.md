- Maybe I am a bit unusual here, but I am less stressed if I have my phone with me. Because I can spend like an hour in the morning taking care of everything instead of I sit there and wonder what I missed or wonder what's happening. So it's way less stressful for me to just answer my phone.

- I think you can say a lot of evil behavior by companies is short-term optimization.

- Check-ins are cool, but kind of a pain.
- I believe whatever smart, ambitious people are working on will be the trend of the future. I do think that it's worth thinking critically about what the future will be.

- If a company is profitable, the founder is in control. If it's not, investors are in control.
- There is a lot of stuff I like. I love backpacking. I love going to an island where I can just sit on the beach and read or scuba dive and sail. I do a lot of that. I still go backpacking around Europe in the summers and staying in hostels. I love that.
- Loopt wouldn't have happened without Y Combinator.
- I think that inexpensive sources of planet-friendly energy are one of the most important things for us to pursue.

- Loopt isn't a service that keeps you locked in, staring at your screen.
- I always tell my partners that our job is to fund all the companies we can that can be worth $10 billion or more. That's such a difficult constraint, we can't have any other constraints.
- A lot of people don't love their bank.
- There is a long history of founders returning to companies and doing great things. Founders are able to set the vision for their companies with an authority no one else can.
- Don't hire for the sake of hiring. Hire because there is no other way to do what you want to do.

- The nice thing about Reddit is, we don't have to sell your data or build a profile of you or do stuff that makes people feel uncomfortable.

- If the Reddit community cannot learn to balance authenticity and compassion, it may be a great website, but it will never be a truly great community.
- I get up late, have an espresso, and immediately start work.

I try to schedule my meetings in the afternoon.

- Intelligence is usually easy to tell in a 10-minute conversation. Determination is harder.
- I think the mistake people make most often when they invest in other kinds of startups is they say, 'This is totally different.' And so the things that matter, like making a product that people desperately want, like talking to customers, they throw this out the window. That is a recipe for heartache and tears.
- Many founders hire just because it seems like a cool thing to do, and people always ask how many employees you have.
- If you have the opportunity to go be an early employee at a company that's just going crazy, and you believe it's the next Facebook or Google, you should go join that company.

- It's easy to say, 'I'm going to build something that already exists,' but it's difficult to clearly and succinctly describe something new.

- Background updating is absolutely the future.
- The thing about Y Combinator that's cool is that most companies won't happen if we don't fund them.
- The hard part of running a business is that there are a hundred things that you could be doing, and only five of those actually matter, and only one of them matters more than all of the rest of them combined. So figuring out there is a critical path thing to focus on and ignoring everything else is really important.

- AI will probably most likely lead to the end of the world, but in the meantime, there'll be great companies.
- Generally, you want to raise capital either when you have to or when it's really easy. If the company desperately needs money, and they can't figure out any other way, then they need to raise money. Or if someone's offering you easy money on good terms, you should take it because you can use it for good things.
- Startups on the inside are always badly broken.
- Never put your family, friends, or significant other low on your priority list. Prefer a handful of truly close friends to a hundred acquaintances.

- With Loopt Star, consumers get to tap interactive rewards wherever they may be.
- The way to really scale a venture firm is with software.
- Sometimes people think Y Combinator has big ideas about themes. But really, we just fund the best startups.
- Making money is often more fun than spending it, though I personally have never regretted money I've spent on friends, new experiences, saving time, travel, and causes I believe in.
- Asking what I'd do without Loopt is almost like asking what I would do if I didn't have a smartphone because the feature set has become the norm for me.
- Tech companies tend to do tech best.
- People hate searching.
- The point of an accelerator is to teach you about companies and business, not about technology.
- All throughout my life I have been deeply immersed in startups, either because I was running one or investing in them or helping them.

- I suppose if I didn't have Loopt, I'd have to, I don't know, pick up the phone and just start calling people, a lot more texting and certainly more Googling.
- All companies that grow really big do so in only one way: people recommend the product or service to other people.
- For most of the early hires you make in a startup, experience doesn't matter very much, and you should go for aptitude.
- There's this famous observation that I totally believe: Great startup ideas are the ones that lie in the intersection of the Venn diagram of 'is a good idea' and 'looks like a bad idea.' So you want most people to think it's a bad idea and thus not compete with you until you get giant. But for it to secretly be good.
- Ideas are cheap and easy, and there are a lot of them.
- All the reasons that have made software so successful are beginning to happen with hardware. So much can be done so quickly, prototyped so rapidly, and the costs are so low.
- Whoever Boost works with, Sprint will work with. And whoever Sprint works with, Verizon and AT&T will as well.
- The reduction in compassion that happens when we're all behind computer screens is not good for the world.
- Companies generally work better when they are smaller. It's always worth spending time to think about the least amount of projects/work you can feasibly do, and then having as small a team as possible to do it.
