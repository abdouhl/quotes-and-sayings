- I was a Presbyterian minister at a small church in Omaha, Nebraska.
- I picked up a harmonica and taught myself.
- Music was in the air when I was growing up. My siblings Katy, Dave and Phil were musical; my dad worked in inner-city New York where a musical revolution was taking place - folk music, rock n' roll, gospel music. My sister taught me to sing. My brothers taught me to play.
