- Through PETA, we rescue animals in roadside zoos and circuses. They are some of the most abused animals in the country.

- There are certain times you realize you've got too much money. One was when I started getting bills from the Koi hotel. When I was remodeling the Koi pond, the Koi had to go to the Koi hotel. They ended up staying there for 13 months and I never asked what the bill was.
- The truth is, I have more money than I'm interested in spending. Everyone in my family is taken care of.
- One of the things about animal rights, which is not the only thing that I care about in this world, is that your money can bring success. I see results.
- A lot of charities spend a million dollars on a fundraiser to make $15,000. It's a social swirl. They do some great stuff and then - it's called mission drift. It becomes more about the parties.
