- It's so unfair on 'Dancing With the Stars,' because when the men celebrities are competing, all you look at is the females! So nobody really watches them. Then when you see the women stars competing, you're expecting them to look like the females and they just can't! It's an unfair advantage.
- It's important for me to be respected and to be thought of as authentic and true to myself. So even if country music won't play my music, I'm not gonna go and record a party song or a truck song just to try to get spins. I have to be authentic to myself.

- Sometimes I would have to get up before school, saddle my horse and go get cows in that had gotten out.
- I think human beings are drawn to other human beings who are beautiful or handsome. I do think that it probably helps to sway people towards liking somebody, if they're handsome or if they're fit or if they dress good. It probably shouldn't be that way but it's almost like human nature.
