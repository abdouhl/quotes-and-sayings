- Growing up, I really wanted my own theater company, and I really wanted to do theater, so I was consciously pursuing it.
- Theatre is such a joy because it's a group effort. Everyone has to move in tandem. It was lovely to be able to carry that over into 'Barry.'
- I moved to London when I was 19 and went to a three-year drama-and-conservatory training. I lived there for almost ten years.
- When I was in theater school, we did these relationship exercises - you would play my sister, and I'd give you all this information about my sister, and then we'd get up and perform this scene, and you'd pretend to react as my sister. It was like therapy!
- There's a competitive grief atmosphere in acting classes. Like, whoever has the biggest trauma is sort of like the winner of the day today or gets the A+. That, I could identify with from when I sort of dabbled with method acting classes when I was a teenager.
- In Vancouver, you have to lock your doors - not for strangers, but for bears.
- I was obsessed with 'Reality Bites' and 'My So-Called Life.'
- Working with Henry Winkler is like the biggest dream come true. He's the mench of menches.
- I feel lucky. I grew up in an open-minded, multi-cultural community in West Vancouver in Canada. There were people who had escaped some kind of oppression. Some of them were first-generation immigrants, others were one or two generations back.
- There's a lot of pressure to look a certain way, act a certain way, have enough Instagram followers.
- I remember sitting in front of the British Museum and having a moment - an epiphany, I guess - that I just had to live here. And now that I have grown to understand the British sense of humour here, I love the culture, too.
- The thing I love about theater is the fact that everyone's complicit. We're either there as a storyteller, or we're there as a listener, and it's basically a campfire situation.
- You read so many scripts, especially pilots, that really feel like marbles in your mouth when you go to read them out loud.
- As an actor, you're just trying to get work in any medium. I remember when I started out, I did motion capture for video games, and then I did a terrible Best Buy commercial for Best Buy employees.
