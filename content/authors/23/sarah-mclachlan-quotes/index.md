- I go out on the road for much longer than I probably should and lose more of myself than I should.
- I have a full life: I have two amazing kids, I have great friends, great family. And right now, that's plenty for me to manage. A new relationship just seems like way too much work.
- Half the bloody world is going through a divorce; more than that are having children. All of us have parents who are dying or have died. It's just the life cycle.
- I've been so busy I haven't had a chance to go crazy. I don't party like I used to.
