- I'm fine at Atletico. I don't want to leave.
- Hard things make me happy. You get upset, but you mature and improve: the quicker you reach your best level, the longer you stay there. They say players peak at 28; I wanted to be there at 22, 23.
- 'What doesn't kill you makes you stronger?' In my case, I suppose it's not just a cliche.
- For me and for Atletico, it's the same: Simeone is everything.
- I want challenges that really test me, very difficult ones. I was the same as a kid: when you play with players your own age, it doesn't bring out your best.
- We know that every minute at Atletico counts for so much, and we know we have to give our all.
- During that year with Madrid, I learned many things; I matured a lot. It was a difficult year because many non-sporting things were happening.
- I will stay at Atletico; there is no doubt about that.
- I have improved a lot, but I would like to improve more, to be better defensively and understand the play better.
- I don't see myself outside Atletico; something very surprising would have to happen.
- Griezmann needs to think about what he says. You have to think about where you are and what team you represent.
- When you are wearing the jersey that you love and are getting playing time, in the end, you value that much more than other things.
- Fulham wanted me when I was 16. They were in the Premier League at the time with Mark Hughes, and I was close to going.
- Sometimes you lose the head a bit, and lose your position, when you should be more relaxed and hold your position, which is better for the team.
- At Atletico, I always played with older players, sometimes out of position. I'd keep going back until I beat them.
- I would give Fernando Torres a contract for life - not just as a player but as an example for everyone. He is a very nice guy, really close to the fans, and has inside him the values of Atletico Madrid.
