- I want to spend more time with my family, and get back to what made me enjoy making games in the first place.
- I hate delaying a project that's already seen so many delays, but I have to go with my instincts on what I think will be exciting and interesting, and what I think the fanbase will really want to see.
- The truth is that every fanbase has its 'toxic' side, and that's because every fanbase has a huge variety of ages, a huge variety of opinions, and a huge variety of maturities.
- Remember Foxy Fighters from 'Update 2?' I loved working on that game. It was a lot of fun, and it took a lot of the pressure off me knowing that it was just for the fans of the games.
- There will always be people who irritate you, inside and outside of any fanbase. That's not a fault of the fanbase, it's a fault of people, and we're all guilty.
- The games after 'Five Nights at Freddy's 3' will not exist in the movie universe. Like it or hate it, I felt that this was the best portion of the storyline to really focus in on.
- Maybe I'll try my hand at a pizzeria tycoon game, who knows.
- I worked as a cashier. I had three bosses who were all still in high school. Before that I worked at Target in the backroom freezer, unloading frozen foods.
- Each game should be better than the last. But that pressure starts to mount, and I fear that I've been neglecting other things in my life for the sake of trying to keep up with those mounting expectations.
- The new game that I'm working on will be called 'FNAF World.' It will not be a horror game, but a role playing game where you create a party using the huge selection of characters from the 'FNaF' games, including the classic, withered, toy, phantom, and nightmare versions.
- I haven't had a successful life; and now that God has blessed me with some success, I'm doing my best to be responsible with that success.
- I'm sticking to what I've always said, either the right movie gets made or no movie gets made.
- It's difficult when people seem to dislike you only because you've found success with something.
- I don't party on weekends, I don't get drunk or sip martinis. I spend my evenings playing 'Megaman 3,' buster only, with my kids.
- If you liked repairing Funtime Freddy up-close in 'Sister Location,' just wait until you try to do something like that in VR, up close, personal, with these huge animatronics that are just one mistake away from jumping at you.
- With each game's release, I think the expectations get higher and higher for the next, and rightfully so.
- I want you to know that focusing on someone else's failure or success is the wrong way to live.
- People who make videos bashing other people are like people who run into a public square and scream into a pillow. They'll get attention, but they won't change anything.
