- I'm a pretty low-key North Carolina boy. I like to go fishing and hang out with my friends.
- I don't speak Spanish. I've done Spanish 1 and 2 classes. My grandma asked me when I was young if I wanted to learn Spanish, and I guess I was young. I should have, because it would have helped me a lot.
- For me, my number one priority always has to be the music, and I'm going to work school around my music - not music around my school.
- Somebody described it to me the best as when you go in to write a song with two people that you've never met, you're pretty much going in and taking off your pants in front of strangers, so it's a really weird feeling.
- When you're the opener, you're the guy getting the crowd warmed up. But when you're the headliner, you're the main dude. People come to see you, and you have to deliver. It's a cool position to be in.
- One thing I love about Josh Turner is his faith; that's why I looked up to him so much.
- I keep a lot of my old baseball hats, and if you look in the hats I've had since I started pitching, you'll see 'Philippians 4:13' written on the brim. That's the Scripture that gets me through the day because sometimes you can't do it all by yourself. You can't do it on your own, so you lean on Him.
- Just the title of 'American Idol' is something that people can look up to. I'm not Saint Scott, I'm not Mr. Perfect, but I want to be that role model.
- I've told many people that I'm not looking to go out there and find the most beautiful girl in the world who likes me because I'm 'Mr. American Idol Scott McCreery.' If I could just find a nice hometown girl who just likes me for who I am, that's all I want.
- I'm in college at North Carolina State University. I'm about to start my sophomore year and have an apartment on campus with three buddies I've grown up with. I get to be normal when I'm there, and then I tour Thursday through Sunday.
- It's so surreal being here.
- I've dealt with losing close ones before, and I've been around friends that have lost friends at a young age. I think it's important to think about - not necessarily death, but about life and think about where you're going and how you want to be remembered and the legacy you want to leave.
- I was watching the show last year and it didn't even cross my mind that this could even happen.
- I don't think you'd call me a traditionalist. But you can say I have an old soul, because I grew up listening to Conway Twitty and Hank Williams.
- If my life were a song it would probably be titled 'Roller Coaster', up and down all the time.
- For me, the best vacation is just relaxing on the couch!
- 'Something More' is a song that I wrote not necessarily about country radio, more so about a lot of songs that were being pitched to me. I wrote that after song after song after song was just the same song, just a different melody, so I was just looking for something more to put on the record.
- I'm still single, but me and Lauren are really really really close friends.
- You gotta 'be' country music - you can't just sing it.
- You know I used to sit there and I'd go outside and play ball and everything, but now in my free time I just kind of lay back and relax because this atmosphere is so busy and stressful, so anytime I can sleep, you'd best believe I'm sleepin'.
- I want to go to Nashville and get cracking on this album.
- I gotta get a truck.
- I wanted to have more songs with religious backgrounds. The Christmas record has strong, traditional hymns, but it also has a song called 'Christmas in Heaven' about missing someone that you love that's passed on, and wondering what's going on up there on Christmas.
- When they first said I made it through it was just crazy, I mean all kinds of thoughts were going through my head, and you know to be watching the show for nine seasons and to be on it now is surreal, it's so surreal.
- I love singin' in the car, it just makes me feel good.
- I'm sure those rumors are spread, but it's just ah - we're really good friend. We've been since day one in Hollywood. In class, we've been together in school. We've gotten really close, but I don't know about the more than friends stuff.
- Country music is me, it's what I've grown up with, and it's what I do.
- What makes me unique is that I'm normal.
- It's a new game now, you know, you have to bring some fresh stuff.
- I want to do music the rest of my life.
- I don't want to put anyone down, but you won't see any twerking from me.
- The minute I get a big head and start acting like the big man on campus, it's all downhill from there.
- When you're out there talking about your faith and what you believe in, you'll face some backlash. But mostly, I've received support.
- I love Florida Georgia Line. I love 'Round Here.' So if a fan wants to listen to that, and if a fan that wasn't listening to country music before is listening to 'Cruise' on Pandora, and after that a song by George Jones comes on, they may have never heard George Jones before. I think it's a good thing for the genre.
- My favorite type of music to sing is country, and my favorite type of music to listen to is country.
- That's the last thing I want to do is go on up there and mess up, you know, in front of America.
- I was an Elvis freak. That's all I listened to growing up.
- I wanted people to see that I really am a real person. I'm not just some guy who was on a TV show, some guy engulfed in the Hollywood life. I'm just a normal guy when it comes down to it.
- The road is a fun place, and it's a great place to get out there and explore the country. But as far as the road life with the 'rock n' roll temptations,' there's not much of that with me.
