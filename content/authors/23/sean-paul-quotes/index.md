- Most people are fortunate enough to stay two, three years in this game. I've been in it for seven years, and I feel like now, I'm just beginning.
- I know some very political people who rap, and they say very political things and they'll never get a deal.
- I remember being a bathtub singer. You know, the type that sings and everybody's like, 'Shut up.'
- 'Rent-a-tile' means when you go to a dance hall, some people take the middle of the dance floor and do their thing.
- It's about ladies, as usual. I'm telling the ladies I got the right temperature to keep them warm.
- 'Time Rolls On' is my most political piece so far. It's not on my album because people didn't support it.
- I don't want to do something unproductive with my time, so I decided to do something musical. So it felt good to say, 'Yeah, I'm producing.' It gave me a fresh vibe - inspiring in a different way.
- I see dancehall reggae and hip-hop as fused together, When I was a kid, they were the two kinds of music that spoke to me and said 'Move!'
- I like music when it makes you feel.
- Every time you think a negative thought, it's one step in the wrong direction, for me.
- I'm a big hip-hop fan since being a kid. It was the first music that spoke to me and made me feel like, 'Yeah.'
- I'm still working on my career, still trying to learn from other artistes and develop my skills and my style.
- I've been approached by many different people, but I don't really want to be known as a collaboration dude.
- Music is your own talent and is an important tool. Even if you don't want to be a role model, get ready to be in the public eye. Energy is there, you just have to use it.
- Dancehall is just like hip-hop in that it doesn't always talk about bling; it talks about conscious issues.
- On 'Sufferer,' I'm talking about the younger generation that has no other option for success than to find a gun somewhere. I try to appeal to them: 'I know you a sufferer, but it doesn't mean that you can't or shouldn't expect any better.' It's a lot different than from what I usually say, like, 'Get busy, shake that thing.'
- I think kids should have a mentor and a role model, but that they shouldn't take one person's opinion to be what we call final assessment or judgment about how life is supposed to be.
- Please remember we all come from the same one and we will all return to that one, so there is no reason for fighting.
- I love the idea of the street vibe, having folks together, out in the street at midnight.
- By the time my first album was out, I had been out in Jamaica three or four years, but I had hits out at that time that were bona fide hits.
- The world still hasn't seen the best of Sean Paul.
- I do feel I have a responsibility to the youths. For real.
- Sometimes you have to take a break from being a crazy kid. You can't be doing that all the time. Sometimes you just have to pay respect to your own simple-ness.
- My flow follows sometimes what's going on in the hip-hop industry even though I'm speaking Jamaican patois.
- I would like to work with anyone in the business who wants to give respect back to the Jamaican vibe.
- Music tells you about the artist and what they were thinking about at the time, because the person has to think about it to sing it.
- With everything that's thrown at you, whether it be problems at home, problems at work - whatever - basically, if you remain positive, you can see your way out of that.
- My lyrics come from my experiences growing up in life, trying to find out and express who I am. That's basically it. I'm not trying to be a prophet or anything like that. I'm just reflecting on life.
- I feel like I have things to say. And that's what I'm looking forward to.
