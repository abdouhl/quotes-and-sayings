- If you're getting abandonment, if you're getting abuse as a child, if you're getting uncertainty when you're a child, unfortunately you tend to look for that in your life later on, and you think that's love.
- My job as an actor is to just tell the story as best I can from my character's point of view and let the audience decide.
- I was born in Romania and later lived in Vienna, Austria, for a few years, and I eventually made my way over to New York in '95.
- Playing an unstable, bipolar, multiple-personality-disorder person is definitely up my alley.
- I specifically remember doing the musical 'Sweet Charity' at Stagedoor. I was playing Vittorio Vidal, which is a very funny part, and some other small roles. I couldn't really sing that well, but there were so many fun bits, and I just remember the tremendous adrenaline rush I felt from being onstage and hearing the audience enjoying it.
- I live in New York and I love it, because it doesn't make me feel like my life is always just about acting and that world of acting. I don't have expectations.

- I do like 'Game of Thrones.' I really like it.
- I came here from Romania when I was 12 years old. I had an accent. High school was tough a little bit for a few years. I wanted to fit in. I wanted to be liked. I wanted to be good-looking. I wanted to be popular. I spent a lot of time thinking, 'What are these people going to think of me?'
- I was Danny Zuko in 'Grease,' and I was in the musical 'Sweet Charity' and then in the musical 'On the Twentieth Century.' They were great. I mean, singing isn't really my strong suit, but I just really enjoyed it.
- You can't judge a character, and you're never going to always play characters that are morally sound or know right from wrong.
- Just to get a job is always really exciting to me. I do feel there's a lot left for me to learn about movies, the subtleties of acting.
- I've gotten really good at not judging characters.
- The things I learned from my parents, what was deeply ingrained in their generation, is this idea of opportunity and the freedom to have an opportunity. The way the United States was thought of is as a place you can have this chance to do anything, to say, 'This is my idea, and I get to offer it to you, and if you like it, I can profit from it.'

- I love the '50s and grew up loving works from that time period and from those great playwrights.
- I've been in so many crazy experiences in my life. I was always moving when I was a kid. When I look back, it's hard for me not to feel that certain things just happen for a reason.
- I think it gets a little harder as you find more success. As success happens, you have to figure out this question of 'What I am going to do next that stands out?' Because then you get seen as 'this thing,' which is a part of you. But it's not really you.
- Theater is the most challenging thing to do. It's just you out there with no rope. You can't call time out; you're on a roller coaster.
- Comic-book movies are mythology, in a way, and there are a lot more parallels in them with what's going on in the real world than people want to discuss.

- I like to be lean and flexible. I'm not interested in gaining size.
- Sometimes with films you have a freedom to be able to, Okay, we got that take so let's try another one where suddenly I'll say this, or you'll get to improv. You can't do that with stage. We have to make it new every time, and also within the structured settings.

- When I was younger, it was so much easier. All I needed to do was just get a job. It was like, 'Oh, my God, I have a job! I can call myself a working actor.' But then, the older you get, you have to be more selective, and that's tough.
- Most of the people I admire as actors didn't make it until their mid-30s: the Mark Ruffalos, the John Hawkeses of the world.

- I always look at auditions as not even getting the job as much as I'm just trying to connect with this casting director so they remember me for next time.
- When I work on a part, one of the things I love to do is to put together a collage of things, stuff I see or stuff that inspires me, images, whatever.
- The thing that sticks to me most about theater is that because it's such an ape crazy nonstop experience, you really don't have time to think about anything else. You're just really present; you have to be, or else, you know, you can't stop the play.
