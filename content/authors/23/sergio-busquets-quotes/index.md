- Bit by bit my work is being recognised. I am very happy at that.
- We always go out to win.
- We already know what Leo is capable of and it's a pleasure to see him on a daily basis. The level of effectiveness he has in training and matches is tremendous. He is fundamental in free-kicks, in open play, that's why he's the best player in the world.
- Oriol Romeu is very strong and doesn't lose possession much. He's a very complete player and makes good cover.
- I don't do many interviews.
- Neymar has the capability to be a leader in the absence of Leo. He's one of those players who can make the team feel better.
- The only thing that interests me is my team.
- For me, a Catalan, who plays for Barca, for me to play in Madrid - that would be very difficult.
- We respect all our opponents.
- I play the way I am as a person. I don't panic, I'm patient.

- I don't want people talking about me, for good or bad.
- In the world of football only the results are important.
- Messi is really unpredictable. He's head-and-shoulders above everyone. Undeniably.
- I can be the only defensive midfielder and try and break up play. Or I can play a little more forward.
- It's special when you win the World Cup, the league, everything.
- More than stopping the counter-attack when it happens you want to prevent it from starting.
- When a team plays you by pressing so high, if you do not take advantage, they grow in their field, with their atmosphere and the goals they are making.
- With Messi in the side, we have the chance to win every title.
- I've always wanted to play at Old Trafford.
- It isn't important what formation is on the field, but rather our attitude.
- There are a lot of great midfielders in the world, with each having their own unique style.
- The more better players we have at Barcelona, the better it is for the team and coach.
- I would be a dream to score against Madrid, that would be an unforgettable goal.
- I prefer the feeling of helping the team rather than shining above it.
- I love my role, I love the job I do.
- Every manager is different in one way or another, but what stays the same is coaching Barcelona players - players who want the ball, who want to be protagonists on the field - so each manager who's been here has been able to take advantage of that, and, luckily, I feel we've become more complete because of it.
- Stadiums are full, pitches are good, the press is different, people are different, the football culture is different. Everyone talks highly of England and I'd like to experience it one day. You see more space, more opportunity to enjoy your football. It's more physical, more intense, but I think I'd be comfortable.
- Romeu is a physical and very powerful player.
- The important thing is to be well and enjoy things - that's essential for me.
- In the Champions League, there are no weak teams.
- In the media, I do not feel recognised, but that's because I don't put myself in the media. I'm not a player who is always on Twitter or Facebook.
- A result doesn't determine the planning on the sporting side.
- An Ibra-Messi tandem would have been marvellous, but history decided otherwise.
- For us, Messi is the best.

- For me it's best to play midfield but if the team needs it, I can play anywhere.
- Whatever the coach wants. I'll be his man.
- Figo was my hero. Then he joined Madrid. Barca fans hated him for that. It was impossible for him to be a hero any more, but now that I'm a professional, I see things differently.
- If you want to play showy football and be noticed then mine isn't the position to pick.
- I have always said there are just two people who could make me change my decision to stay at Barcelona. One of those two people is my wife.
- When you lose there are things that you don't do well.
- Without my team-mates I could not do anything.
- The impact of Luis Enrique has been very positive. He has very clear ideas about football and we've absorbed them.
- When you're young it's boring to be a keeper.
- I am a team player who tries to work for the team.
- If I lose the ball I cause the team a problem. I am here to provide solutions.
- To reach the appearance total of Xavi is impossible, I'm not thinking about that.
- On a tactical level the defensive midfielder in a 4-3-3 formation is just about the most demanding position there is.
- If there's a problem, I prefer to have to swallow that myself than force a team-mate to do so. I think about them because in my position that is what your job consists of.
- We know the Premier League is a spectacular league. We would like to play there, but if you take all the positives and all the negatives, it's very difficult to leave Barcelona. If you feel at home and you're from Barcelona it's difficult to change.
- I admire Luis Enrique's desire to work and improve.
- There has to be everything, but above all respect. Sometimes you cross the barrier of respect for many things - because you do not want to let the rival be, for being the eternal rival.
- Truth to be told, yes, it does feel very strange to be in the Spain setup without Xavi. Ever since I broke through for Barca and Spain he's always been around. We've always had a great relationship and he's always set an example in every way, when it comes to camaraderie, how much help he's given me and, above all, in footballing terms.
- I admire the Premier League for the quality and style of football.
- In society and in football in Spain, achievements are not always appreciated or valued.
- It sounds elementary, but I've seen some really talented kids leave Barca because they wouldn't listen or thought they had become a professional before they did. If you are not good in a group then you don't have a place at Barca.
- In a final, it's winning that counts, it's not the style of play that people remember.
- There's only one Neymar.
- I genuinely enjoy watching the full-back run up the pitch and going across to fill in.
- It's great playing alongside Xavi and Iniesta because you know that you're always going to get the ball cleanly from them.
- It has more repercussion when the referee favours us than when we are harmed.
- In personal terms, Ibra is a great guy. He's a serious guy, who makes fun of you when you least expect it.
- Messi is a star in every sense. He is not as timid as he seems.
- This is football, no more explanation, sometimes the best team does not win.
- I don't score many goals or do much dribbling, but I still feel very much an important part of the team.
- La Liga has the best teams, who fight for all the European trophies, so it's very difficult to win.
- All away games in the Champions League are difficult.
- I've always said that I won't be a Barcelona player for 20 years with a secondary role. The moment that I feel my ambition is fading or that I am not able to deliver physically, I will step aside and leave feeling privileged and content of what I gave to the club.
- You need to know exactly where to be on the pitch at all times.
- People who don't like football don't appreciate my game, but I like it.
- It's the Champions League that really gets the Barcelona fans buzzing.
- You always have to look at every game and seek to correct mistakes.
- All players want to play and this is a source of pride and satisfaction.
- As kids we'd be forever shooting at dad and I started as a striker, but I eventually became a pivote, the position I like most and best suits my characteristics.
- It's an honour to be able to wear the No.5 jersey and that Carles Puyol thought of me to inherit it.
- The work is intense. You have to calculate a great deal very quickly which requires football intelligence and real concentration. Part of my role is to shuttle between the defense and the attacking lines to make sure that the ball circulates well and quickly.
- If it was up to me, I'd get rid of Twitter to stop the fake profiles and people saying and doing what they want.
- Everyone has to be in charge of their own destiny.
- I feel valued by my team-mates and coaches.
- I'm a team player who needs to work a lot and sacrifice myself for the success of the group.
- At times, I lack privacy.
