- I feel very fortunate to have been associated with people such as Rodgers and Hammerstein. I think they were geniuses of their time.
- After I won the Oscar, my salary doubled, my friends tripled, my children became more popular at school, my butcher made a pass at me, and my maid hit me up for a raise.
- I'm a fan of Jerome Kern and Gershwin. That's my kind of music.

- It's great to see that celebrities can be just like us - that they too have their highs and lows, that they don't always wake up looking their best, that they have bad habits and annoying traits.
- I wanted some family structure and stability, and that's what The Partridge Family afforded me, not only financially but in the fact that I could be at home with my kids.
- I had done 25 motion pictures prior to The Partridge Family and nobody knew my name.
