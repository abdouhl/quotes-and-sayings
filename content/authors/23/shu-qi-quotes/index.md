quotes = ['''I have a lot of Japanese fans, but in Korea they seem to go crazy for me. I don't know what it is, but they seem to like my style.''' ,'''I'm not really a money-oriented person. The press always write that I am. They don't seem to want to understand that I love the comfort of Japan and love the fact it's more peaceful, less frenzied than Hong Kong.''' ,'''I need to make the characters that I play in movies more accessible to audiences, more real. As an actor, you're always passive; you're not making that many choices, so when something allows you to open up a bit, you want to explore your newfound freedom.''' ,'''I don't like these commercial films I do. I'd far prefer to do more artistic films, more cult films.''' ,'''Having no competition is a bad thing. Competition makes you try to improve yourself all the time.''' ,]
