- At 13 years old, I was doing grown-man things, so I know who I am, and I'm telling people who I am.
- Glizzy Gang is a real movement. They had movements back when I was younger, in the '90s, but you don't really have a major movement in the 2000s.
- I don't want to be stuck in the same spot, just dropping mixtapes for no reason.
- I'm worried about myself. Glizzy gang, that's it. I'm not worried about no other rappers.
- I ain't go on media and spazz. That's what crash dummies do. That ain't what I do.
- I'm not even worried about the Internet; that ain't even my thing. I'm not even an Internet guy. You rarely even see me into that.
- None of my songs sound the same. None of them. I take R&B beats and put it as a rap song or hip-hop beats and put them as a R&B song. A lot of people are boring. I don't like boring music. Everybody sounds the same, like they copying.
- There was a point in time, when I put out the Chief Keef diss, where I was so hot that everybody was calling my phone. But I decided to go set up under Wale, but he wasn't really teaching me how to rap.
- I don't know rap. I can't tell you a Tupac song. But you put on some go-go, and I'll know it word-for-word. That's why I feel like I got my own sound - or a D.C. sound.
- If I don't get in the studio, I don't have no therapy.
- My fan base just growing and growing. People know that I'm not just coming and going. They know that I'm here to stay.
- Everyone can relate to me no matter what race or who you are or how you feeling.
- No one shows love. There's no unity between the artists and the streets. There's none of that in D.C. You're never gonna get love in D.C. If you get love in D.C., then you're a special person.
- The love that I get outweighs the hate.
- I have an EP coming soon with Cardo. It's called 'Glizzy Got Wings.' I love his sound, and he loves mine.
- My music is genuine, and I'm talking about stuff that no one else - no one my age, anyway, in the game - is talking about. Nobody. I'm the only one really stating facts and speaking with real street knowledge.
- 'Awwsome' was a different type of song for an artist like me, but it's still a true song. I was talking street stuff, but I was feeling awesome.
- I make my fans feel like they are part of the movement, and if you a fan of the movement, you're going to feel like you ride with me.
- When that music comes on, I just block everything around me out.
- Nothing that I say in my music is a lie.
- In my hood, I was always with the older guys.
- 'Law 3' shows my growth as a rapper. I don't really like maintaining, so on every project, I'm going to show you my growth.
- 'Free the Gang,' that's my favorite song because it's so real. All my music is real, it's authentic, but it's something about that song that I love.
