quotes = ['''There are a lot of visual marks that have to be hit, and lines that need to be said in a right way - so there wasn't really any improvisation on the set when it came to the bulk of the script.''' ,'''There's this thing of you can live in a city and be completely alone, not notice anything going on around you.''' ,'''You don't look at each other on the subway.''' ,'''I loved playing Shaun, he's not that different from me.''' ,'''You look at shows like The Simpsons or Larry Sanders or Curb Your Enthusiasm or Seinfeld, they're really sophisticated shows that we all love back home.''' ,'''The only spoof I think is the title, which was just we thought of very early on and it kind of stuck.''' ,'''I don't know about doing a sequel. I think you can retroactively damage a product by adding to it.''' ,'''I think that the joke and the ghost story both have a similar set up in that you kind of set something up and pay it off with a laugh or a scare.''' ,'''We suddenly saw how people reacted in the event of massive social upheaval, and the way that the little problems in your life don't go away. You don't stop being frightened of spiders just because the world's blown up.''' ,'''You always worry about films when you hear about them making decisions after announcements are made.''' ,'''American audiences tend to be more expressive than British ones.''' ,'''In England, we don't have any guns whatsoever.''' ,'''There is a universality to comedy.''' ,'''We don't watch the film anymore because we've seen it so many times, so we'll introduce it, walk out and we'll come back in right about when I wake up in the morning and walk over to the shop and everything's changed.''' ,'''Doctor Who was a big part of my childhood so it was a great honour to be in it.''' ,'''I used to lie in bed in my flat and imagine what would happen if there was a zombie attack.''' ,'''I just love listening to the laughter.''' ,'''Every person should have their escape route planned. I think everyone has an apocalypse fantasy, what would I do in the event of the end of the world, and we just basically - me and Nick - said what would we do, where would we head?''' ,'''The main jokes in this film are about big things, love and life and zombies - we all get that.''' ,'''We work with every one of them to see if their character wouldn't say a certain thing or if something is worded awkwardly - we work with them to rectify that.''' ,'''There are actually quite high profile British TV star cameos in it that you probably wouldn't even notice, that the British wouldn't even notice, let alone the American audience.''' ,'''I think at its best the American sense of humor is the same as the British sense of humor at its best, which is to be wry and ironic and self deprecating.''' ,'''I mean, yeah, I'm sure that Python and the other things have paved the way for a greater understanding of the British sense of humor, but I don't think it's all that different than the American sense of humor.''' ,'''Chris Martin's a good friend of mine. I'm actually Apple's godfather. He's an old friend and we've been mates for quite a few years now.''' ,'''Both me and Edgar are firm believers in never underestimating or talking down to an audience, and giving an audience something to do, to give them something which is entirely up to them to enter into the film and find these hidden things and whatever.''' ,'''The simple fact is that what you see on the screen is pretty much real.''' ,'''That's what we wanted to get across in that moment, particularly when Shaun goes to the shop when he's all hung over. He doesn't notice any of the zombies around him just because he never had before, so why should he at that point?''' ,'''Also, if you watch the film once, there are lots of things that you won't get because there are punch lines in the first act, the setup to which isn't until the second act.''' ,]
