- I get offered loads of unusual stuff. I just don't do loads because I like staying at home a lot, and I'm a little bit lazy. I don't get that thing of going from film to film that people do. It would drive me nuts, and that level of fame is quite scary.
- I do love being an actress. The other stuff, the 'fame', well - you know what? - you don't actually have to buy into it if you don't want to.
- With everything in my life, I don't think too much ahead.
- The photo shoot I always feel a bit embarrassed about because I don't really know what to do with myself, but they usually don't use a bad photo, so you can't worry too much. So my main concern is that I just look a bit more like myself.
- Sometimes I really need the money, really need to go straight to work. But if I had the absolute choice - money no object, my mortgage paid off - I'd really just work once or twice a year - but wouldn't everybody! - or at least do a different job sometimes.
- The repetition of the theatre means you've got the time to get deeply inside the person you're playing.
- The tried and tested becomes very boring. There's no way that the British equivalent of a Bryan Cranston would get the lead in a British equivalent of 'Breaking Bad.'
- Being in the theatre is like being in a little family: you get really close.
- There's nothing worse than actors spouting about what they think.
- I don't like going for more than a year without doing theatre. I don't mind falling flat on my face so long as I feel I'm open to the possibility of something extraordinary happening.
- I love the industry I'm in, and it's been really generous to me.
- My life is not nuts. I hardly ever watch television, I don't go out very much, so I don't really know what's going on.
- It was a dream to be on Broadway as a kid, so to actually end up there, I loved it.
- I always find something in all the characters I play. I fall in love with them a little bit.
- I'm drawn to stories about ordinary people who get tangled up in an extraordinary event or idea or emotion. I'm not saying I don't love films about super-people or super-doctors, but my preference is for stories about how we get through this life, what it is to be human, because I'm always struggling with it myself.
- I am rather partial to Shakespeare, though I haven't done loads. But when it's done right, there's nothing like it. There are layers upon layers upon layers, and you unpack new things constantly. I don't know how he knew so many things - about the world, about women, about human nature, life, death, our fears and hopes.
- I can't, for example, Google myself, because I am very sensitive.
- My first love is a wonderful script. It's the story.
- I always try to think of positive things to say about the people I portray, as it's more helpful for me.
- There is a lot more opportunity now, and I welcome all the conversations we are having about diversity, about women and about class... I come from a very working-class background, and I think the class thing is still probably more tricky.
- Anyone can play anyone in Shakespeare. I don't think there are limits.
- Theatre has always been ahead in terms of colourblind casting.
- I like having the script before I start. With new plays, you're constantly developing as you're doing it. It's really frightening. You don't quite know how it's going to end up.
- I love being a punter.
- Being a character actor, I can go on until I'm 70 or 80; I'm not bound to the way I look.
- My main form of exercise is my bike. I don't have a car, so I cycle everywhere.
- I'd hate to lose the character actress part of me, because, by God, the parts are much more interesting.
- When I do things that aren't very good, I'm worse as an actor. I don't know what I pick up - but it's something not very nice.
- But I'll tell you what I'm really bad at: I don't concentrate on what I'm doing, so I constantly lose things. I put my purse in the fridge - I'm one of those people.
- If the writers all come from the same backgrounds, you are going to get the same sorts of characters. Get a broader variety of writers, and you get a bigger range of stories.
- When I take on a role, all I tend to do is get to know the script and ask millions of questions, and keep fine tuning what I think the character is trying to say.
- I am not a practising Jew, and I am not embedded in Nigerian culture, but I have a sense of those things inside me, which is very handy for acting. There are a lot of things I can draw on.
- There are just more roles for me in America. Sadly. Because I love working in Britain. It's my home.
- As a child, I certainly wanted to have hair that I could grow long and flip around. I no longer want that. My own hair that I have day to day is a fuzzy afro. And that's who I am.
- I never watch anything I do. I really would rather just not know at all how I come across.
- As a black actress, all I was offered in British film was the best friend role, whereas in TV I was offered a whole spectrum of parts.
- I just get offered a lot more work in America than I do in Britain.
- I listen much better when I'm acting than I do in real life.
- I've told lots of lies in my life. I try not to lie, but I still do. It's very difficult to get to 37 and not be ashamed of something you've done. But I think your life is easier, ultimately, if you're honest.
- I'm not from an acting family. I'm from a working class family.
- I never suffered anti-Semitic racism because no one thought I was Jewish.
- I like gardening.
- I find it so all-encompassing when acting that there's no room for anything else when you're in it; you're just locked into thinking about it all day, you go to sleep with it, wake up with it, and when I come back, I really need time to recover.
- To get an award for something you are having a ball doing is a real buzz.
