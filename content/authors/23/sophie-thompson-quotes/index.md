- I wonder what it was like to be an actor years ago. We're so respected now and I don't think it does us any good. We used to be vagabonds. I want to be a vagabond!
- Wyndham's is a beautiful old theatre. The sensation on the stage isn't as different as you might think from the Royal Court.
- Martin Sheen is my pinup! And Allison Janney, oh my God. They're brilliant actors.
- People say there's a book in everyone but I'm not sure there is. There might be a pamphlet in me.
- I took my children to see 'Son of Rambow,' about two boys who make a home movie with a video camera. When you have children, culturally you become involved in their life.
- I've just finished reading a book about the brilliant Margaret Rutherford. She wasn't a beauty, but inside she was absolutely blazing and passionate about her work. She's one of those life-affirming characters.
- I look back at that time fondly. It's something I never thought I'd get the chance to do, be in a soap. Working with Barbara Windsor and Steve McFadden - they're legends in their own lifetimes aren't they?
- I haven't played Hedda Gabler yet, but maybe if I did I might find the funny bits.
- I am an opera virgin; I'd far prefer to see a musical such as 'Guys and Dolls.'
- I think I always wanted to be an actor - sounds a bit boring, doesn't it? And I pretended once that I wanted to be a vet because one of the teachers asked me and saying you want to be an actor sounds a little bit silly. And I do still feel a bit silly saying it. You feel a bit fraudulent.
- Awards are always a pleasant surprise. They are the candy-floss parts of our job - a lovely added extra to attract people's attention. The bottom line is that you want to sell tickets.
- As an actor you get categorized by other people, but it's not like I arrange myself into comedy mode or serious mode. If it's good writing you just have to play it true - if it's funny, it's funny. But obviously you don't want it to be amusing if you're playing Hedda Gabler!
- I like to sing along to Annie Lennox and pretend to be as sassy as her.
- I must confess that I'm not a great reader. At the moment I'm reading my son's 'Stig of the Dump' by Clive King and I've got a plant catalogue on the go.
- I'm not a natural reader but there are books I'll read and read again.
