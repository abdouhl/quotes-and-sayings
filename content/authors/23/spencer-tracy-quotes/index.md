- I couldn't be a director because I couldn't put up with the actors. I don't have the patience. Why, I'd probably kill the actors. Not to mention some of the beautiful actresses.
- I'm disappointed in acting as a craft. I want everything to go back to Orson Welles and fake noses and changing your voice. It's become so much about personality.
- Acting to me is always reacting.
- This mug of mine is as plain as a barn door. Why should people pay 35 cents to look at it?
- Concentrate, don't embroider.
- Acting is not an important job in the scheme of things. Plumbing is.
- Acting is not the noblest profession in the world, but there are things lower than acting. Not many, mind you - but politicians give you something to look down on from time to time.
- It is up to us to give ourselves recognition. If we wait for it to come from others, we feel resentful when it doesn't, and when it does, we may well reject it.
- Know your lines and don't bump into the furniture.
