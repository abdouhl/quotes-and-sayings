quotes = ['''I'm one of seven, so I do want a big family.''' ,'''Homeschooling has always been at the back of my mind, because whenever I am with the boys and we are out in different environments their senses heighten and their enthusiasm to learn is at its best.''' ,'''I want people to know that when you see me on TV with glossy, bleached blonde locks it's not my real hair.''' ,'''I genuinely think I've got a nice body, I like looking at my body and I don't think there's anything wrong with it.''' ,'''From as far back as I can remember, I was scared and anxious.''' ,'''Sometimes, I have to make a point of saying to myself: 'You know what Stace, if you don't have a bath one day this week, it's not going to do you any favours. If you don't turn your phone off for the day today and say 'no,' you're going to be impacted negatively.'''' ,'''My hair seems to be such an appealing environment for nits so I have to be on my guard.''' ,'''My biggest fear is not being around for my children.''' ,'''We all have our insecurities - no matter what shape or size we are.''' ,'''I've known for a long time that my personality makes me seem not very intelligent, or not very serious.''' ,'''I was so awkward and gangly, and went through puberty way too young - I got really self-conscious about it.''' ,'''There are so many different ways in which someone is 'intelligent.' In my opinion this doesn't always have to be measured by academic achievement.''' ,'''I love my children more than anything in the world.''' ,'''Let's stop telling people from modest backgrounds that their education is capped at a certain level because of where they grew up. In fact I can attest to the fact that all this attitude does is put people off wanting to test the waters and apply, or push themselves towards higher education at all.''' ,'''I don't want to be the same all the time and changing my hair is loads of fun.''' ,'''People are so offended by female body hair. SO offended! They actually say things like, 'Ugh, those hairs are so long.' But we have no issues with a man being head-to-toe hairy. It's so weird.''' ,'''Sometimes, a blended family is amazing and sometimes it's heartbreaking. There will be moments when you feel like you are completely failing. But, if you love your family, that is absolutely enough.''' ,'''My parents are pretty strict 'education first - fun later' kind of parents.''' ,'''I had no traumatic childhood experiences.''' ,'''I really struggle with my anxiety, I have done since I was a child. When I look back into it, I don't know what happened to make me the way I am, but it's definitely affected my anxiety levels and I've spent most of my life looking for coping mechanisms.''' ,'''Sometimes, my anxiety is really dark. Like, I can't breathe, and feel like I'm having a heart attack.''' ,'''If I could give my 14-year-old self any advice it would be to look after your hair. Don't mess with it!''' ,'''I am used to the low expectations people have of me: I have a bubbly personality, I smile a lot; I am very feminine.''' ,'''I find shaving in general an utter chore so even removing the hair on the body parts that are on display happens on the rarest of occasions.''' ,'''You can't just be one thing all of the time.''' ,'''From the age of ten I was a full blown fuzz ball to the point that my so-called friends called me 'Hairy McLary From Donaldson's Dairy.'''' ,'''There is a big old joke around the 'Loose Women' team that I never shave my legs.''' ,'''All of my life I've been met with shock and disbelief if I've ever come out with anything remotely smart, as if people are thinking, 'how does this happy little Essex girl know anything?'''' ,'''I just have never been a drinker. No matter how much I try I just can't stand the taste of it or the way it makes me feel out of control, which is a no-go for an anxiety-ridden control freak like me.''' ,'''The infuriating thing about not liking your weight when you're slim is that there's no sympathy and very rarely any help.''' ,'''Nurturing and spending time and effort on what's happening underneath our exteriors is much more lucrative than spending a lifetime and shed load of money on your outside.''' ,'''I can take on the world with a glue gun and a can of spray paint!''' ,'''I always want to have children running around in the garden and so I don't know what I am going to do with myself once they're all grown up.''' ,'''One of the biggest misconceptions about homeschooling, and the ones my friends seemed most concerned about, is that children won't socialise and will have a limited ability to communicate when they get older. I can honestly say this is a myth.''' ,'''I only ever became conscious of how hairy I was when I got to Year Six, the last year of primary school.''' ,'''I feel we just assume all fathers who no longer have involvement in their children's lives is through choice. I know, first hand, this is absolutely not the case.''' ,'''I used to get nits all the time as a kid. I was six when I first encountered the egg planting hair vermin.''' ,'''Note to self: never eat garlic before a fashion show because everyone greets you with a kiss on both cheeks.''' ,'''I think we all need to accept that some people feel insecure about their body shape even when they're super slim.''' ,'''Going through adolescence looking like a hormone experiment wasn't easy.''' ,'''I get so many lovely messages and so many people tag me in their own crafting and upcycling and I love it.''' ,'''Teachers are amazing.''' ,'''I don't have time to sit down and airbush my lumps and bumps. I don't want to either, because they're all a part of my life and what I've been through and who I am.''' ,'''What's disgraceful is that any Tom, Dick and Harry can open up a clinic and administer Botox.''' ,'''Thank God for my family - I'm so lucky and I don't know who I would be without them.''' ,'''My grandfather is from Burma and while the tanned skin and Cleopatra eyes skipped my genetic make-up, I inherited the full hairy gene.''' ,'''Choosing when and whether to have a baby is a fundamental right for all women, no matter where they live.''' ,'''People always warned me not to dye my hair too much or use too much heat but I ignored their advice. I always wanted to go blonder, straighter, slicker. The result? Wiry, broken strands and a psoriasis-ridden scalp. Stress causes flare-ups and it's so damn itchy.''' ,'''My older sister Jemma is naturally slim, at least three dress sizes smaller than me - though I don't want to say what dress sizes we are, because I don't think the number on your clothing label is important.''' ,'''I love something new and I'm always willing to step into the unknown when it comes to hair.''' ,'''My family practised our faith in a relaxed manner.

I guess then, if things start to happen, you immediately think, 'Do I even deserve this?'''' ,'''At my worst, I was so fearful of death I'd think about it for six hours a day.''' ,'''As a father you're guilty until proven innocent. You're a second class citizen in terms of parenting. As a father you have to prove your ability to be a father whilst residence, power and control is left solely with the mother.''' ,'''Just to make it clear, I do not have a problem with anyone who decides to have Botox.''' ,'''I think the trauma of giving birth made me feel vulnerable and I wasn't invincible. Giving birth made me feel like I could die at any minute.''' ,'''I remember the time I had nits. It all started with an itchy head. I assumed I had a dry scalp and that maybe my extensions had grown out too long.''' ,'''Sometimes, we set ourselves up for this perfect ideal scenario and when it doesn't go that way, it's hard to deal with.''' ,'''I really feel sorry for society-labelled 'pretty' people who have to prove their personalities because no one can believe they bothered to make one based on how they look.''' ,'''I would like to be good at macrame.

Anything savoury; nuts, crisps, sandwiches!''' ,'''My mum is incredible, she is able to be there whenever I need her and I am extremely lucky.''' ,'''I've felt like my whole life, I've had to prove I'm not an idiot.''' ,'''As a person who has lived through my parents' divorce, I don't feel lesser or that I've missed out. I didn't become an adult and think: 'My family really messed me up.'''' ,'''Being happy in a relationship isn't the be all and end all to feeling confident, but it definitely gives it another dimension.''' ,'''Anything with pockets is a winner for me because I never know what to do with my hands when somebody takes a photo of me.''' ,'''It's an individual's choice to do whatever they please to their own bodies. However I have a massive problem with the notion that people think it's okay telling young people that they need Botox and fillers.''' ,'''Being a teenage mum and a single parent hasn't been easy but I wouldn't change it for the world.''' ,'''I feel my most relaxed when I apply myself to a task.''' ,'''I'm not perfect, I'm not brilliant at everything, I just try my best and I enjoy crafting.

It is okay to get older and look older. It doesn't make you any less of a human being or any less beautiful.''' ,'''I never want a child-free house.''' ,'''I get the utmost pleasure in life out of showing my children how much I adore the life out of them.''' ,'''Bedtime is when I get most anxious because I have time to contemplate. I'm also more likely to question my mortality and catastrophise if I've seen or heard something upsetting about somebody.''' ,'''I feel to really understand a video game, and whether it's right for your child, the only thing you can do is play it.''' ,'''Loads of people talk about meditation and what it can do for your anxiety and I just really struggle to do traditional meditation. When they say, 'Lay still and empty your brain,' the minute I lay still, is the minute I think about everything that's going on.''' ,'''The girls at 'Loose Women' are my actual friends. They're not just telly friends.''' ,'''I made a wedding planning book and a whole double page is dedicated to the dogs.''' ,'''I have a tendency to catastrophise and doing something that you have control over is an escape from that.''' ,'''I'm not confrontational in any way.''' ,'''I went to a Christian primary school where I felt included and no different to my peers.''' ,'''I was born into such a loving, caring family who were super liberal and supported me no matter what.''' ,'''You can't please all the people all of the time, and I don't expect them to like everything I wear or do.''' ,]
