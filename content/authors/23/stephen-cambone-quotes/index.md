I think the reason for that is fairly evident, in terms of vulnerabilities of the department and the harm that can come to it by failing to detect when we have, in fact, been harmed.''' ,'''We've complemented that with a second office to think about how we need to prepare ourselves for that period 10 or 15 or 20 years from now, by way of investment in our technology, our organization and our people.''' ,'''The users are not going to be in the position of accepting what's been collected; they're going to be in the position of being able to demand collection.''' ,'''The office has oversight of people who do analysis and oversight of people who do operations, but it is not charged with doing either. That is an important point to make. Those functions are performed by the CIA, DIA and other agencies.''' ,'''But by providing the background picture - the universal situational awareness that we desire - by showing the anomalies, the Space-Based Radar will change the nature of how we do our analysis and our intelligence.''' ,'''That is really not much different from the search engines that are being constructed today for users throughout the entire world to allow them to search through databases to access the information that they require.''' ,'''Over the course of two years, we arrived at a point where we began to look at the value added by making information more easily accessible across the intelligence community, both defense and national.''' ,'''So we have a group within the office that is devoted to support for the war fighter. That's, of necessity, an operational and tactical level of concern.''' ,'''And to do that not only for the war fighter, but also to help prepare the people in the acquisition, personnel and policy worlds who need to make adjustments in the department's business, which itself may take 10 or 15 years to accomplish.''' ,'''One is to ensure that the war fighters and the intelligence analysts get the information that they need when they need it, in a format that's useful to them.''' ,'''And the reason for focusing on that time frame is that it's going to take us a considerable period of time to develop the new capabilities, processes and organizations that will be needed.''' ,]
