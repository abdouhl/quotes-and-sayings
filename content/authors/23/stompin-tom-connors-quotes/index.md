quotes = ['''My retirement, back in 1976, began as a one-year boycott to challenge the media on that question. I refused to return until the media, and radio stations in particular, got a hold on identifiably Canadian songs.''' ,'''On every album I've put out, I've put diverse Canadian songs on it.
