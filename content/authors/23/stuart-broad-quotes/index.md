quotes = ['''There are always distractions in international cricket because that's part of being an international sportsman.''' ,'''When you are performing at the top level you don't get many chances to go back to basics as you are in elite performance mode. It's hard to break your technique or action down when it always needs to be at a match intensity.''' ,'''I'm not someone who looks to swing the ball away majorly.''' ,'''It's very important in international cricket to be able to hold a bat, not just hold up an end, but have the ability to score runs.''' ,'''A large part of my childhood was spent holding a cricket bat. The first time I picked one up was in the garden aged about six, and I've never really put the bat down since.''' ,'''I definitely have my dad's competitive streak in me.''' ,'''It's quite strange, because off the field I'm quite shy, quiet, prefer to watch a bit of TV at home, but get me on the cricket field I like it all kicking off.''' ,'''I try to look for tempo in my run-up to make sure my knees are lifting up instead of going long. That brings an energy to my run-up, try and make myself feel as tall as I can.''' ,'''For Leicestershire, through the age groups, I didn't bowl at all. My height was below average for my age up until 17 when I had a big growth spurt. My bowling kicked on from there because I could get bounce from a fuller length and shape the ball away.''' ,'''When two players are playing with passion for their country, that's good to see.''' ,'''Selfridges is ideal for the lazy shopper because everything is under one roof.''' ,'''Shaun Pollock is actually the best role model for me as a very good attritional bowler.''' ,'''I know the International Cricket Council are very strict about what you are allowed to do and what looks good on TV, but you can't let that take away from your natural game.''' ,'''The history of Test cricket will suggest if you hold the top of off longer than anyone else you will have success, in England particularly it's about owning the top of off.''' ,'''Playing for England is the most important thing in my life.''' ,'''In international sport you get distractions all the time, but at the end of the day that shouldn't affect how you deliver a ball or how you hit a ball.''' ,'''When I glare, I don't see it as aggression. I have just got such passion to get wickets. I don't ever say anything, I just have a look and see if I can get their mind concentrating on other things and get them outside their bubble. I like to get them switched on, have a look and get in a bit of a battle.''' ,'''I might be six foot six but that doesn't mean I can play a Steve Harmison role and bounce people out.''' ,'''Paul Nixon taught me to break a run chase down into little targets. I suppose I stole his cues and took them into my own game.''' ,'''You have to deal with your emotions and not spike too much on the graph - not get too elated with the highs or too down with the lows.''' ,'''I have watched games at the Gabba since I was a youngster, staying up for the first 10 minutes until I fell asleep.''' ,'''People talk about cricket being an individual game but I really don't agree; everything is done in a partnership.''' ,'''Part and parcel of being an international sportsman is dealing with fair or unfair criticism and also when you are on the back pages when you are performing.''' ,'''It's a huge privilege to be named England Twenty20 captain and form part of a leadership team that I've no doubt will work well together with a great deal of synergy.''' ,'''My life changed forever the first time I went to the southern hemisphere.''' ,'''In Twenty20 the less fear you play with the better you're going to do.''' ,'''I know I'm a better bowler and create more chances if I get a batsman indecisive in defence.''' ,'''I've not gone out of my way to live a celebrity lifestyle, which I could easily have done.''' ,'''I live in Nottingham. I love just being at home. I can shut my front door, and it's like a little haven to me rather than thinking about going to certain places to... look good.''' ,'''I've always had an interest in the media, I love cricket, so why wouldn't I want to be around it?''' ,'''My favourite commentators are the ones that don't need to hear the sound of their own voice the whole time.''' ,'''I always loved bowling.''' ,'''When I was a youngster my grandparents took me sightseeing and we went on the London Eye.''' ,'''I turned out to be a very good cement-mixer.''' ,'''I don't really understand Darren Lehmann coming out and saying the South African crowd has been out of order. Any England player, even media, who have toured Australia can laugh at those comments because some of the things we hear on the pitch from Australian supporters, known as 'banter,' I know is worse than in South Africa.''' ,'''Ultimately we're playing cricket and we want guys who will score runs and take catches to help England win.''' ,'''I'll play as long as that competitive spirit and drive is there because that's what gets me up in the morning, that feeling of having a batsman drive at you, play and miss, the sort of theatre around that sort of stuff.''' ,'''If someone wants to try to hit a spinner over mid-on, with the ball turning away from the blade, there is a chance of taking a wicket.''' ,'''We weren't wealthy but we weren't poor either. My mum was a teacher and my dad, Chris, was an England international cricketer. We were always taught respect when it came to money, and that stands me in good stead now. I've always respected my parents, and still look to them for advice when I need it.''' ,'''It is important as a bowler that you always need to have a presence. If you lose that you lose quite a bit, a big part of your armoury. It comes naturally with me, and at times it is a huge advantage. I don't want to lose it. I want to keep getting wickets.''' ,'''I am one of these characters who seems to thrive off a little bit of niggle, a little bit of pressure.''' ,'''I really like watches and have about eight.''' ,'''I've always enjoyed playing the shortest form of the game and I relish the opportunity to develop my leadership skills as England's Twenty20 captain.''' ,'''I found Ricky Ponting the hardest to bowl to and it was a great pleasure to play against him as he was genuinely one of the best that's ever played and a really tough competitor as well. He hated you when you were on the field but he always shook your hand and was the epitome of 'play hard but play fair.'''' ,'''I have a dream of playing 100 Tests.''' ,'''It is certainly not how I've been brought up and it's not in my blood to play cricket in that safety-first way.''' ,'''Within the changing room, everyone has always known I'm best when I pitch the ball up and get a little bit of movement.''' ,'''I'm a passionate player when I pull that England shirt on; it's a very special and proud moment for you.''' ,'''My role changes quite a lot, but ultimately I've always admired Glenn McGrath.''' ,'''International cricket and Test cricket in particular is hard and you are going to get injuries but, if you've got a strong pool of players to pick from who can all come in and do a job, well that can only be a good thing for English cricket.''' ,'''It's just important to try to keep a cool head and stay logical rather than emotional. But then again you have to keep that balance between not becoming too logical because you need to have that passion in order to play to 100% in the game.''' ,'''My earliest memories were in the back of my grandad's car listening to Test Match Special.''' ,'''The best player I've played with would be Graeme Swann, just because he's proved that regular finger-spinners can take wickets in international cricket for England.''' ,'''I play cricket for the competitive side of it.''' ,'''You get judged on your results.''' ,'''I'd rather be the guy you can turn to in a high-pressure scenario than a dead rubber.''' ,'''People say I inherited my feisty attitude on the cricket pitch from my dad, but he and I might disagree. The most useful trait I've inherited from my mother is to make sure that I'm always organised.''' ,'''I love winning, I love playing to win. You need some of that to be a bowler. You need to have a hatred for the batsman to make sure you have that real fire to perform.''' ,'''I need to keep moving my game forward, because Test batsmen will keep moving their games forward.''' ,'''I've always targeted that number eight spot.''' ,'''When you're young you're influenced by the best teams. So a lot of my favourite cricketers were Australian.''' ,'''I don't think you can let comments affect you too much as then you are not doing your job properly.''' ,'''Bowlers have to accept they will go for runs sometimes.''' ,'''That's one of the good things about cricket, the friendships around the game.''' ,'''I think that the older I get, the more I play, you realise when it's your time.''' ,'''As a bowler I think I am more wicket-based than some.''' ,'''I want to be known for my cricketing ability.''' ,'''As soon as you come into the England team, the ICC get hold of you; you're put through this video, which is very watchable, very clear - it takes you back to when you were five or six, that's how clear it is. It outlines everything you're not allowed to do, everything you are allowed to do.''' ,'''Glenn McGrath's my hero, so I did a lot of reading on him when I was growing up.''' ,'''I am more aggressive than others, being a sportsman.''' ,'''Without the players, there's no game.''' ,'''If you are the sort of character who likes to feel you are in a battle, then make sure you do that.''' ,'''If I've got a run-out chance to win the game I want to take it.''' ,'''You have to have a part of you like that as a bowler - that fire in you to keep going.''' ,'''You have got to try to make the batsman feel a bit uncomfortable to get him out.''' ,'''Playing for your country may seem like a massive thing, but you can build it into something it's not and put yourself under pressure from what the media say, but at the end of the day it's not life and death.''' ,'''Marcus Trescothick. No question. I hate bowling to him. I pitch it up, he drives me through the covers. I bowl back of a length, he runs me down to third-man. I go short, and he lifts me over the keeper or pulls me for four.''' ,'''As a player you get asked to do different roles within the side.''' ,'''When you look at the best Nos. 6 and 7 in the world, they all average above 45, so gone are the days when you could get away with someone at 6 or 7 who's below 40. You need to have those runs on the board.''' ,'''When I watch sport I like to see the likes of Wayne Rooney when they show a bit of passion. It shows they really care when they're playing for their club and their country.''' ,'''Can't resist Haribos.''' ,'''It is a proud moment to lead England out any time you do and on a world stage it gives it an extra oomph as well but it will be down there with the biggest lows if we don't win.''' ,'''Everyone knows I've got a pretty passionate outlook on my cricket - and sometimes it does get the better of me.''' ,'''My outlook is that when you're under pressure then that is when you play your best cricket. You've got no choice but to perform to keep your place and I find that brings out the best in me.''' ,'''The shorter the game is then the bigger the chance of an upset.''' ,'''I don't want to lose any of that passion for the game; as a bowler I need to have that real desire to get the batsman out and be in their face and be aggressive.''' ,'''I like it when the captain comes to me and says, 'We're really desperate for a wicket, can you get us one?' or when we really need something to happen in a Test match.''' ,'''My father was a great mentor to me and is someone I admire and look up to. However, it was my mum who was more of a driving force when it came to me and cricket - she constantly encouraged me to always remember to have fun when playing. And Mum was the one who took me round the grounds at the beginning of my career.''' ,'''I'm just very passionate to win games for my country - and sometimes when things don't go my way, I'll get a little bit narky.''' ,'''I'm a private person.''' ,'''As a sportsman you are always testing your limits.''' ,'''I'm aware how special an achievement 100 caps is because of the players that have come before me and the amount they've given to English cricket.''' ,'''That's one of the nice things about being a sportsman is that once you cross that white line, it is a freedom, you are away from everything in life really. You are playing cricket and that's an escape from everything. That's as clear as you get really.''' ,'''Tower Bridge would make a cool house. I like the idea of living over the river.''' ,'''The more you can keep your action and your mind and the ball you are delivering as simple as you can nothing can go wrong.''' ,'''I love taking the new ball, but you've got to earn that right.''' ,'''Our training schedule can change quite a bit throughout the year - if you're going into quite a heavy Test match workload a lot of it's based on recovery and a lot of aerobic work is done in that period.''' ,'''I love that feeling of being in a battle with the new ball, you're getting an opening batsman out while they are desperate to survive.''' ,'''I like to take wickets and see wickets and chances and I think in T20 cricket you have to risk a boundary to take a wicket.''' ,]
