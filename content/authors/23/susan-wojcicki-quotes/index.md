- I have this desire to create things and build things, and Google has enabled me to build and create things and to build products that are used by people all over the globe.
- Even though it was a start-up with fewer than 20 people, and I was pregnant with my first child, the best decision I've ever made was to join Google in 1999. Worst decision? Deciding to get a puppy and a bunny right when the baby came.
- I think we have to recognize as an industry that users have a lot more choices and can click away to a lot more media. As a result, the advertising we create really needs to be something users want to see.
- People don't understand the logistics of advertising. To have the ads purchased and run, you need to have a series of products that work together.
- YouTube has moved culture forward in attitudes - on refugees, on LGBT issues - especially trans issues. There was untapped demand there; a lot of our users would still be under-served without us. We're a platform that enables everyone to have a voice.
- I love creating. I had been really into photography when I was in college.
- Advertising is very simple in a lot of ways. Advertisers go where the users go, and users are choosing to spend a lot more time online.
- Girls are being left out of the conversation when it comes to technology, led to think of tech as insular and antisocial without ever being given a chance to correct those perceptions.

- I think about my own career, and when I graduated from college, the Internet didn't really exist yet. And so not having a specific plan, being able to be opportunistic at the end, is what enabled me to make some of my best decisions, which is to go to places that were growing but that I didn't plan to have happen.
- Coding is like writing, and we live in a time of the new industrial revolution. What's happened is that maybe everybody knows how to use computers, like they know how to read, but they don't know how to write.

- I've been, like, the mom of Google.
- Though we do need more women to graduate with technical degrees, I always like to remind women that you don't need to have science or technology degrees to build a career in tech.
- Even in a culture where people are well meaning, there are sometimes 'microaggressions.' People who will just cut you off. You'll be talking, and someone will interrupt you. That's become a big pet peeve of mine.
- I think the phone is a really personal device in a lot of ways. If you drop your phone or lose it there's a moment of panic. On the other hand there's a lot of control that users have.

- I don't feel like I'm a perfect mom, and then there are times at work where I feel like maybe I wasn't perfect here because of constraints on my time. But having the sum of both of those things going on in my life makes me a better mom at the end of the day, and I think gives me really important perspectives in the workplace as well.
- I have had a lot of setbacks that I have learned from.
- First there's my role just as an executive being responsible for advertising, regardless of gender. I think that's a position that I take seriously. That's the first role.

- I'm excited about the opportunities with mobile phones and being able to receive information on the go and relevant to what I'm doing at that moment in time.
- Many women assume they can't be good mothers and have challenging careers at the same time, so they might give up trying to do both as they get to a crucial point in their career. Although it can be hard at times, it's important for women to recognize the benefits of working outside the home.
- Don't overplan your life. Joining Google when I was four months pregnant was a bit of a leap, but sometimes you have to do the right thing for you right now.

- People don't understand the logistics of advertising.
- After my kids go to bed, I check email. It's about having that balance.
- Engineering is a jeans and hoodie culture, and sales is more formal.
- CEOs need to say, 'We're going to make sure this is a great environment for all types of people.' I was a beneficiary of that. I got support from the leaders of Google - all men.

- I think I've always been able to see what's coming, and when I was joining Google, people always said, 'Why are you joining this company?' It was so small at the time. I could see the importance of Google. I could see the way it was going to grow; it was going to become a big company.
- Google is a business that gets paid when users want to see - want to click on - the ad. If we show ads that no one wants to see, we don't generate revenue.
- Advertising is a very fundamental need, so I don't think it's going to go away.
- I have tried in my role of being one of the first women at Google, let alone the first woman to have a baby, to really try to set the tone that this is a great place to work for diversity reasons.

- Let's face it: Engineering companies in general have more men than women. Google has tried really hard to recruit women. On the other hand, we have a standard. Google tries to recruit the best engineers.

- Today, most young women are exposed to technology at a very young age, with mobile phones, tablets, the Web or social media. They are much more proficient with technology than prior generations since they use it for all their school work, communication and entertainment.
- YouTube is growing up, is basically my view of it. Growing up means our creators are growing up; they're getting more well known. We're providing programs for them to generate more revenue so they can generate even better, high-quality shows, and then also connecting them with the advertisers.
- I am responsible for creating and overseeing the future products that make up Google Advertising.
- At the end of the day, both men and women who become CEOs have showed tenacity and hard work to succeed in their careers. It takes not just skills but also extreme dedication and commitment. And regardless of gender, CEOs are measured by the same criteria - the growth and success of the business.
- Whether it's salary or a promotion or a job, I think it's important for women to ask for what they think they deserve.
- My smartest move was joining Google. It wasn't obvious at the time that it would be a good decision. A lot of people, many of my friends, advised me against it.
- The fact that women represent such a small portion of the tech workforce shouldn't just be a wake-up call - it should be a Sputnik moment. The tech industry is not America's future; it is our present.
- People complain when ads aren't relevant, and they complain when ads are too relevant.
- If a third of Americans' time is being spent online, why is only a quarter of ad dollars spent there? It's not proportional.
- Google has been doing well. As much as possible we're trying to share back with the employees. They will continue to create a lot of value.
- One of the things that I'm trying to do is use the position that I'm in... to encourage the next generation of girls to think about the Internet as a career opportunity.
- The reason I like my job is that I have this desire to create. I have this desire to create things and build things, and Google has enabled me to build and create things and to build products that are used by people all over the globe.
- Underrepresented employees already have to overcome discriminatory barriers in their careers; they shouldn't be expected to volunteer their time to help their companies do the same.
