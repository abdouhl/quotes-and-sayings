- When you get on stage, you can be anything. You are removed from reality in a way, the real world.

- I liked to read but, being a dancer, I didn't have a lot of time to read.

- That the work involved, the willingness to take chances, the commitment, the opportunity to get on stage and make people happy, was more important than becoming famous, or even what I was dancing.
