quotes = ['''I tend to wear monochromatic outfits - all one colour from head to toe.''' ,'''Food is a very sensitive subject for so many people.''' ,'''I really don't think I ever thought I could be a model.

I did that when I was younger and still do that to this day.''' ,'''I know quite a few eco designers who build dresses out of old couture gowns. They disassemble, 'upcycle,' and reuse them in extraordinary ways. To me, that's a sustainable way of doing things.''' ,'''When 'Avatar' came out, we were out non-stop for a year and a half doing red carpet events. I had a stylist who helped me, but it was really hard, and we couldn't find many sustainable dresses.''' ,'''Growing up in Oklahoma the way I did, and being raised the way I was raised by my parents, gave me such a strong foundation to go out into the world and fly, so to speak, the way I was able to do.''' ,'''My personal style has developed from growing up in Oklahoma, middle America, where I was wearing jeans and cowboy boots and where people were not running around in miniskirts.''' ,'''It would have been very easy for me to put on a little tight skirt and go out and try what I always call the 'Barbie doll' roles.''' ,'''People have their cultural reasons for eating meat, their traditional reasons, their likes and dislikes.''' ,'''I have a soft spot for cashmere - even though that is not a particularly sustainable fabric, I do invest in quality, so it is sustainable in the sense that it is not just throwaway fashion and I keep it for a long, long time.''' ,'''Heading to Paris when I was 17 and modelling exposed me to high fashion, which influenced me to dress on-trend - not extravagantly, but always in fashion.''' ,'''You can't really call yourself an environmentalist if you're still consuming animals. You just can't.''' ,'''What I really wanted to do, actually, was stay home and be a mom and have some more kids.''' ,'''I want our students to be so accustomed to children of other cultures that the words 'diversity' and 'tolerance' won't be in their vocabulary. They won't need them - they'll live it.''' ,'''When we home schooled my oldest, Jasper, in eighth grade, I saw how empowering it is for a child to learn in their own way. That rebooted my thinking about education.''' ,]
