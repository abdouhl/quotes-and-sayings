quotes = ['''I'm really into both sides of the industry - in front of the camera and behind the camera.

I had this beautiful condo in Taluca Lake, but I was like, 'Why am I paying for this when I'm all over?'''' ,'''I actually began my career by convincing my parents to let me be an actress when I was 12 with a PowerPoint presentation describing acting and my goals.''' ,'''Everybody is always like, 'You must be a really good liar,' and no, I'm actually a truth teller, and I'm telling someone else's truth.

I think that, on the outside, it may seem like there's a lot of similarities, but there's also a lot of differences as well.''' ,'''I've been able to work on shows with amazing role models, amazing actors, incredible female filmmakers.''' ,'''I love 'Gone Girl,' so bringing 'Sharp Objects' to life, that was amazing.''' ,'''I love sports, or hiking; you'll always find me outside doing something.''' ,'''I really look up to Amy Adams, who I got to work with, Meryl Streep, and Angelina Jolie.''' ,'''I have to be honest: I've memorized 'Titanic.'''' ,'''I grew up watching 'Gilmore Girls' with my older cousins!''' ,'''Every show is completely different.''' ,'''Working with Amy Adams was amazing.
