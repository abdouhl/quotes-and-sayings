- Granted, my childhood wasn't conventional, but it was full of love.
- There was a Saint Laurent dress that I actually had to hide from my manager. I DJ'd for part of the money, did a shoot and got a discount, and it was still one of my most extravagant purchases. I've worn it loads, even to do chores around the house, so surely that makes it ok?
- I've spent my whole life feeling I should watch what I eat but actually don't.

- I'm a fan of a big roast or a bolognese, but I also love baking.

- I had a year off from the fringe, which was weird for my eyebrows because they hadn't seen the sun for 10 years.
- My grandparents had always helped look after me, they were always there.
- Raw parsley makes me gag. It's the same for my mum and my sister. Which is funny because apparently parsley was used to suffocate witches, back in the day.
- There's this one called Raya that is Tinder for celebrities. You have to do corny things like put a song to photos of yourself: 'Daisy likes pubs! Horse riding! Looks good in a bikini!' It's all so mortifying. My male friend got matched with Courtney Love and if ever there's a reason not to be on those things surely that's it.

- I grew up in the public eye from the age of 15 and it wasn't a choice I made, it just kind of got imposed on me because of who my dad is.

- One of life's finest things is enjoying your food.

- I wish I could dress like a princess every day.
- I think the labels 'Plus Size' and 'Curvy' should be banned. You don't say 'White model' or Skinny model.' Why should 'Plus Size' models have a label.

- I'm so grateful that I model at a time where 'plus-size' models are being championed, but they're still called 'plus-size' which is actually quite a stigma in itself. It's just healthy, curvy women.
