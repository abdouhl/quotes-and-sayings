- I am playing the character of Sanjana in 'Race 3' and it is very a dark character in the initial phase of the film but towards the end, it gets transformed into a positive character.
- There's no need to go out in public and give explanations. As long as you know what's going on between two different individuals and what kind of relationship they share, I don't feel that the world really needs to know about it.
- Given a choice I would only want to work with Salman again and again, but that's not how the industry works.

- It is my drawback that I am not manipulative and this trait doesn't work in the industry. People in the industry are very manipulative.

- The more you talk about your personal life, the more people are going to judge you so it's best to keep a low-profile.

- Speculation and rumor is nothing new in the industry.
- An actor's life is pretty much like any profession, full of highs and lows; only because this is the glamour world - everything gets reported.

- Just because you have a mouth and nobody is stopping you, you can't say whatever you want.
- I think it's a huge a opportunity for me, because I am part of a film that has stars like Salman Khan, Anil Kapoor and Bobby Deol. It will grab eyeballs and I will get noticed, too. I hope 'Race 3' opens more doors for me.
- What eventually counts is whether your film was successful at the box-office or not, or more so if the film has made its money, and 'Race 3' did that.
- Initially, dancing for me was just for pocket money. The dancers are paid well and you get paid on a daily basis. Eventually when I got promoted as an assistant choreographer I was getting paid more. This was during my college days.

- Most importantly, if you feel sexy, you look sexy.
- If you've made it big in Bollywood, such as Kareena Kapoor Khan and Katrina Kaif, and then you do an item song, it becomes a 'guest appearance.' That's how it works. Sadly, that's the attitude of our Hindi film industry.
- Doing stunts all by myself has been a deliberate decision because I wanted to do all stunts by myself because female actors don't get the opportunity to work in action films, and I think when you get such an opportunity, then you have to make most of it.

- Meeting Salman for the first time was my fan moment. He is very endearing... he looks super hot in everything.
- I think filmmaking is a team work and it's a shared responsibility.

- For me, to get break in 'Jai Ho' was a challenge and my journey after that depends on my work and luck so, I think blessing of my parents has helped to reach this stage and I am really fortunate that Salman Khan lifted me from one level and helped me to reach another level.
- My focus is on giving my best and I have to enjoy my performance as then only audience will enjoy.

She was also a dancer and then became an actress so in that way, I relate with her. So I think if I get the chance, I would like to work in a biopic on Mumtaz.
- Salman Khan is loved by a million people and if he has put his faith on me so, I don't want to disappoint him.
- Yes, I have a small coffee corner where I like to sit. It's right next to the windows and the power seat of the living area. When I sit there, I can see Bandra Reclamation in front of me.
