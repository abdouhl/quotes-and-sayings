- I love movies; many an afternoon skipping school were spent in a funky, run-down Brooklyn movie theater.
- I grew up in Brooklyn.
- Sometimes it takes time to become part of the collective unconscious, just like 'Fanboys' did. Going into that movie, I said to myself that if you were a 'Star Wars' fan, you were going to love that movie. It's an homage to everything science-fiction, but especially 'Star Wars.'

- I've been working very hard off-off-off-off-off-off-off Broadway and doing little films and really sweating my butt off in tiny little black boxes.
- When I was on Broadway, people would really just recognize me around the theater. When you're showing up on commercials and posters, the scope of people recognizing you gets a little wider.

- I saw the 'Balls of Fury' script, and I was skeptical at first.
- I have a large pallette of tastes.
- I've had time to taste fame, but I definitely lean towards being the kind of actor where I'm happy to be able to walk down the street and go to the corner store and not get hassled.
- I love all that stuff like 'Tales From The Crypt,' 'Twlight Zone,' and 'Amazing Stories.'
- It's a fine line between magic and science. In medieval times, science was magic.

- I'm an observer - a watcher of movies my whole life.
- Well, I think a lot of people just want to be famous.
- In college, I learned that my favorite parts were the sad clown parts. Those are the ones I love because you get to do everything. You get to be funny, make them laugh one minute, and make them cry the next minute.
- 'Mars Needs Moms' was motion capture, where you walk into a space that's essentially a black box with cameras everywhere. It was so technical. You have these mandibles with cameras on your face and a helmet, and you have to hit certain marks. You couldn't shoot this stuff without the green-screen aspect.
