In fact, I've often told people I was under the impression that everybody voted Republican.''' ,'''The values that I hold are consistent with the party of Lincoln, the party of Reagan, and the party of Trump, of the Republican Party, and so I'm honored to stand with the president.''' ,'''I identify with a different political ideology and therefore that shades the way people view me.''' ,'''Well, let me just say that I condone violence in all of its forms.''' ,'''When I come to work in this capital, I'll visit Mr. Lincoln every day. I've been walking in his footsteps my entire life.''' ,'''Mob justice is not justice. Justice sought by violence is not justice.''' ,'''I hope that folks that look like me, regardless candidly of their political affiliation, not only look at me and say that, you know, I want to vote for him at the ballot box, but also make the decision that perhaps they want to put their name up for public service and for public office.''' ,'''I think often about my ancestors who struggled for freedom, and as I think of those giants and their broad shoulders, I also think about Joe Biden, who says, 'If you are not voting for me, you ain't black.'''' ,'''The criminal law is not meant to respond to every sorrow and grief.''' ,'''Do we really want the truth, or do we want a truth that fits our narrative?''' ,'''I was honored to have the endorsement of the Kentucky Fraternal Order of Police, and they expect me to really advocate for our law enforcement community for a commonwealth and county attorneys.''' ,'''Democracy is a system that recognizes the equality of humans before the law. Whether you are the family of Breonna Taylor or David Dorn, these are the ideals that will heal our nation's wounds.''' ,'''We cannot have chaos reign in the streets.''' ,'''The grand jury process is secretive for a reason, to protect the safety and anonymity of all the grand jurors, witnesses, and innocent persons involved in the proceedings.''' ,'''Even as anarchists mindlessly tear up American cities while attacking police and innocent bystanders, we Republicans do recognize those who work in good faith towards peace, justice, and equality.''' ,'''That's my Republican Party, the Party of Lincoln, that believes America is an indispensable nation... an Evergreen Tree, standing tall in a turbulent world.''' ,'''I grew up in Elizabethtown, Kentucky, Harden County, which is not too far from the birthplace of Abraham Lincoln.''' ,'''The decision before my office is not to decide if the loss of Breonna Taylor's life was a tragedy. The answer to that question is unequivocally yes.''' ,'''My parents are conservatives. Owning a small business lent itself to that viewpoint.''' ,'''Let's be honest: no one is excited about Joe Biden.''' ,'''In my judgment, there is great diversity within the Black community. And Joe Biden doesn't seem to get that message nor understand it.''' ,'''The fact that someone would get on national television and make disparaging comments about me because I'm simply trying to do my job is disgusting.''' ,'''Our investigation found that Mattingly and Cosgrove were justified in their use of force after having been fired upon by Kenneth Walker. This justification bars us from pursuing charges in Ms. Breonna Taylor's death.''' ,'''My ultimate responsibility is to the folks that elected me here in the commonwealth, so I am acutely aware of that obligation and commitment.''' ,'''I think that we need to make sure that we have frank conversations about race and color and discrimination within this country.''' ,'''Our responsibility in the AG's office is to the truth and to the facts.''' ,'''Republicans will never turn a blind eye to unjust acts, but neither will we accept an all-out assault on Western civilization.''' ,'''At the end of the day, my responsibility is to provide facts and truth and represent and stand up for justice.''' ,'''Indictments obtained in the absence of sufficient proof under the law do not stand up and are not fundamentally fair to anyone.''' ,'''I certainly understand the pain that has been brought about by the tragic death of Breonna Taylor. I understand that as a Black man.''' ,'''My values were shaped by my faith, and by my parents. I worked at their small coffee shop, meeting people from all walks of life. And I realized something: everyone needs a cup of coffee.''' ,'''On criminal justice reform: Joe Biden couldn't do it, but President Trump did.
