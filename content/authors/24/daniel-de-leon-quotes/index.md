quotes = ['''Capitalism attacks and destroys all the finer sentiments of the human heart; it ruthlessly sweeps away old traditions and ideas opposed to its progress, and it exploits and corrupts those things once held sacred.''' ,'''Socialism is practical, in the best sense of the term; a living, vital force of inestimable value to society.''' ,'''Poverty breeds lack of self-reliance.''' ,'''Each man has an equal social right to multiply his power of motion by all the social factors of civilization. Private property in any of these factors is inconsistent with this fundamental right; it must, obviously, prove a source of economic despotism and industrial slavery.''' ,'''Make no mistake: The organization of the working class must be both economic and political. The capitalist is organized upon both lines. You must attack him on both.''' ,'''He who stands with his face to the East in the morning will have the sun before him. If he does not change his posture, the Earth in the meantime having changed its, he will have the sun no longer before him, but behind.''' ,]
