Within a few yards of Lenin's Tomb is some of the most expensive shopping in the world.''' ,'''I grew up reading the classic novels of Cold War espionage, and I studied Russian history and Soviet foreign policy.''' ,'''After the fall of the Soviet Union, if you start the clock, then 47 journalists, reporters, cameramen, photographers have been killed in Russia since the fall of communism. That makes it the third most deadly country on Earth to practice journalism. That's not a record to be proud of.''' ,'''I'm a mild-mannered person.''' ,'''I don't have a dark side at all.

All the partisan, cheap partisan warfare stopped.''' ,'''Russia is classic fascism.''' ,'''I'm not comfortable around guns.''' ,]
