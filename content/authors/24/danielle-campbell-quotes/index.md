- I love snowboarding.
- I kind of fell into acting.
- Such a big part of this business is rejection. Each time that you get rejected, a big part of it is just staying positive - even if you don't get the role, it's still giving you practice. I love being able to take direction and talk with the casting directors in the room.
- I grew up playing with dinosaurs instead of Barbie dolls.
- I love the term 'young actress' because it just means that I don't know everything yet, and I hope I never do. I won't. I won't ever know everything.
- I want to get to experience all kinds of roles.
- I grew up curious, and I always wanted to learn about different things.
- I think that's the great thing about acting: you get to play different characters and enhance one part of yourself to really bring that out and create a new person.
- I grew up playing football. I'm a huge hockey and football fan.
- I took acting classes, and I'm always trying to improve myself. Everyone can improve, and the more you work in the industry, the better you are going to feel about it.
- My parents thought it was really important that I grow up with the high school experience, because if I was going to continue acting, there was always going to be time to do that.
- There's a lot to be said for women who want to focus primarily on acting. Other women, on the other hand, aspire to combine their work in acting with other ventures in fashion, business, directing, writing, producing, etc. It's a very personal decision.
- I'm really surprised at how popular 'Starstruck' has become, but I'm so thankful because we worked so hard on it, and I'm happy that so many kids enjoy it. I'm also really happy at how the soundtrack turned out!
- I think, in this business, you grow up quickly because you are surrounded by adults; you are needing to stay present and stay cautious of what you are saying. I have been working since I was 10, but I also went to public high school, so I know how to handle all of it.
- I had so much fun filming 'Starstruck.' It was an amazing experience, and I bonded right away with Sterling Knight, so we had loads of fun together!
- I don't want everyone to think I'm just the girl who acts.
- I'd like to major in drama.
- Being in New York, I have fallen in love with walking and listening to podcasts.
- I never really thought about acting when I was little; I was just getting a haircut at a salon when I was 10, and a woman approached my mom about putting me forward for an audition!
- I have a natural curiosity about the world, and I just love to talk.
- It's fun to play with fashion and clothes.
- Home schooling, to me, would be lonely.
- I just love the outdoors!
- Los Angeles is a really fun town.
- Marion Cotillard is one of my favorite actresses. Not only is she so supremely elegant, but her choices are remarkable. I also admire Margot Robbie. She's been working in film for a long time and is not the kind of actress who had instant breakout success.
- I love wearing jeans. I live in them!
- I love to write. English is my favorite subject in school.
- I never really pictured myself as an actress.
- I've learned it's important to never lock yourself down into one thing - you need to remain fluid and open to all possibilities.
- All of the people in L.A. are really nice, and it's sunny all the time. Plus, there's so much to do there. You can go hiking in the hills, you can go swimming in the ocean, you can go surfing... You can do everything.
- It rarely rains in Hollywood - and I love the rain. There are ups and downs to anywhere in the world, but I get frustrated without any rain.
- I love Blake Lively. She's one of my favorite actresses, and she's got a really classy and beautiful look. She's somebody that I really look up to and follow.
- For 'Prom,' if I had missed high school, I don't think it would come off as real.
- If I weren't acting, I'd study journalism because I love to write.
