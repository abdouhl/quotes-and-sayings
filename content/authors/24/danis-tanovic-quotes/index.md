- I don't think that 'No Man's Land' is a comedy. I think that it's a serious film with a good sense of humour.
- You're only making movies for two reasons: Because you have something to say or because you want to entertain people.
- When you make feature films, you have a script, which is a bible. The final result should be as it was written down on paper. And in documentary, you can write whatever you want, but life brings you situations where you have to be fast thinking, fast moving.
- I'm an honest man. I am living my life. I'm not stealing. And I've never been ashamed of who I am - I am a Roma.
- I started doing documentaries in the first place because of the war. I always wanted to do feature films, and I studied directing when the war started, so I was working with actors before, in film and in theater. So I think it's easy to work with actors when you have a script that is clear, when they know what and why they are doing it.
- In Bosnia and Herzegovina, a country of few but nonetheless good films, it is almost impossible to produce a film without access to various European initiatives and funds. Creative Europe and its media program are essential for our film industry.
- The thing with 'No Man's Land' is not to see it, but how to make people to go to see it. The one negative criticism I've heard is that the relationship between tragedy and comedy is so perfect that it becomes suspicious. I take it as a complement.
- I don't think there's so much difference between making documentaries and feature films. I think it's even harder to make documentaries.
