quotes = ['''I didn't have any stability in my life, so I was probably a bit lost as a person. I didn't know where I fitted in professionally and I didn't really know where I fitted in with my personal life and seeing my son, and it was really confusing. I think if you have one solid, then the other one you can manage.''' ,'''I was out on loan at Barnsley when United accepted an offer for me from Leicester and that was it really. I just had to concentrate on my new club.''' ,'''There's nothing more important in my life than my son.''' ,'''I'm open to going abroad, even though it will be difficult with my son.''' ,'''I wanted to make a difference at Leicester and it was something I needed, to be more focused.''' ,'''Once I got to Leicester, I just wanted to prove myself.''' ,'''Look, I know my Chelsea move hasn't worked out how anybody would have wanted and I've made mistakes, but it's not as simple as me just not playing football or picking up a wage.''' ,'''People like Paul Scholes were in my way at United - what are you going to do with that? You just look at him as an idol. I have watched him since I was a little kid. I couldn't have had a much better teacher.''' ,'''I am a football fan.''' ,'''I need an anchor and I need to sort out one side of my life, so if I can sort my football out, even if it is abroad, then that will help in the long term.''' ,'''I played United's reserves for a few years and I wanted to take that next step, which was a loan move.''' ,'''Even in training Paul Scholes proves he is one of the best midfielders about, and Michael Carrick as well.''' ,'''There were a few things going on then away from football, my nan and grandad passed away quite close together and, this might sound daft to anyone who doesn't have a dog, but my dog passed away and that hurt me.''' ,'''When the whole team is doing well and you're at the top people take note of what you are doing.''' ,'''Weirdly, me and Sarri got along off the pitch, but on the pitch it was totally different.''' ,'''Arsenal are a massive club, and a club a lot of people would love to play for.''' ,'''My lowest point in football? Probably leaving United.''' ,'''Obviously international football is going to be different, I understand that.''' ,'''I wasn't able to see my son as much as I wanted. I thought it would be easy living on my own, do what I want and then travel up to Manchester to see my son, but it wasn't like that.''' ,'''Conte was a big factor in me coming to Chelsea, his passion for football and to win games was something that I looked at and I wanted to be a part of.''' ,'''Money doesn't solve anything.''' ,'''There have been things that come above football that have not been as simple as I'd like.''' ,'''I told myself that I needed to clean myself up big time.''' ,'''I am just playing every game as it comes and, if I impress people, brilliant.''' ,'''I'm definitely a closed book and that's extended through most of my life, not just football.''' ,'''I have taken a good look at myself loads of times.''' ,'''Leicester has been as good for me as I have been for them so I wouldn't want to leave the club, but if it ever comes to it then I guess I will have to.''' ,'''We need to keep fighting for every ball.''' ,'''Going to Leicester, suddenly, football was just my living. This was the way I was going to support my family. That is when I started to mature as a player.''' ,'''I would love to play for Manchester United and, if things go as I want them to, I believe I can achieve that.''' ,'''Making a breakthrough at the big clubs, a lot of it is down to luck with your timing.''' ,]
