- There are networks and executives who are willing to take risks on vastly different material, and as an actor, there are some really juicy roles to sink your teeth into.
- It's very important that we do show appreciation for those who go to work in raising awareness. You know, Tourette Syndrome is not well known. There's not a lot of government money and research in it. But people are dying inside every day because they're suffering with it, and I think word needs to get out.
- When I'm acting and I have to remember my lines and put my mind in concert with my body, I don't tic.
- I think acting is therapeutic for me.
- Tourette's is involuntary in that it is impossible not to do. And it's torture to know what you're doing and not be able to stop it.
- I spent my life figuring out ways to make the room OK with me.
- My first tic was to shake my head violently. I was in karate class, and I was shaking violently. All of a sudden, I just started to notice that the teacher was looking at me, and all the kids were wondering what I was doing. I suddenly felt really strange.
- I don't know if I ever realized, initially, that I didn't tic when I was so focused on my acting. I think it was after I had already done it a few years, when I went, 'Hey, interesting that this happens.'
- The great thing about Showtime is that they really give us leeway and the range to explore the real dark side of stuff.
- In the years when teenagers really need to be connected to somebody, they aren't; especially in small towns where kids are bored and look for something to get them going.
- I have been making hip-hop since I was a kid growing up in New York in the '80s and '90s. It's always been a hobby of mine - I've been making beats and writing songs for as long or longer than I've been acting.
- With Tourette's, there's this element of vulnerability and compassion and empathy that you innately possess because of the affliction.
- Here's the thing: I had never been to Boston, my whole life. Probably because I'm a Yankee fan.
- I love it behind the camera as much as I do in front.
- It's challenging to take on something else that is not you and make it very real and have others be able to associate with it. It's wonderful to provoke thought.
- I had this tic where I touch my mouth to my knee, and I'm always screwing up my back. I've had two shoulder surgeries. My doctor just smiles and laughs at me.
- A lot of us have done bullying and didn't even realize we did it.
- I want to go play a villain or an action hero or a nice, light, romantic comedy or something. That would be good.
- Every moment in life can be interpreted as a risk, depending on our outlook - and level of obsessive- compulsive disorder! I do my best to depend on my gut. If you sit with a decision long enough, your gut/soul will tell you what path to take.
- Tourette's has always been a tough one for many to digest because of its seeming irrationality: 'Why do you have to twitch or make noises? You seem normal, with no physical defects.' It's next to impossible to answer without living it.
- I think that the reason I became an actor, probably, underneath it, was that I spent my life acting normal.
- I've been to some Hollywood parties where things have happened, and people have probably needed to get a good lawyer.
- Acting is a stressful environment to put yourself into, and stress triggers Tourette's, but I think it's partly an outlet because when I'm acting, I'm putting my mind, body, and soul into something, and that's one of the times during the day when I don't tic.
- I would absolutely love to do another Baz Luhrmann film, especially a 'Moulin Rouge' type picture.
- School was very difficult. I was conscious of how I looked.
- I think there's always an adjustment when somebody new is runnings things, from the top down.
- People believe that if you can shut your Tourette's off for a period of time, then you can always shut it off. I try to explain to people that if I spent my whole life trying to control my tics, that's all I would have time for.
- A lot of talented people have some quirks, y'know? And bless them for that. I'd rather have Tourette's than be someone boring.
- I've seen a shift in general about the literacy of the public to what Tourette's is. And that's a testament to local kids and parents having the courage to share their experience.
- One of my favorite movies is 'Some Like It Hot,' which isn't really a musical, but I'm just such a sucker for old movies. I wouldn't want to ever tarnish one of them, or do a spot-on remake, but just do something light like that where I get to glide across the floor. I would be a very happy camper.
- Auditioning is one of the most nerve-racking things you could ever do, but you have to be so focused that you don't tic.
- I don't think I've ever done a real mini-series, but I love doing film first and foremost.
- If I can just accept it and tic when I want to and have my passion project - what I'm mentally, physically, emotionally invested in something - where you're fully focused, and your body parts and mind are all moving toward this one goal, you're focused, and you can shut it off, but only for a certain period of time. Then, you have to let loose.
- I've have a number of violent tics. With Tourette syndrome, there's not just compulsive actions, but compulsive thoughts as well. That used to scare my mother a lot.
- There's moments when you have to make a split-second decision that will form you for the rest of your life.
- To have someone inspire you to be who you are and be unapologetic about it, it's beautiful.
- I would love to do a Fred Astaire/Gene Kelly type movie musical - a fun, song and dance, romantic comedy. Or, even just play the lead in one of those broad comedies - that would just be fantastic.
- The greatest acting really is spoken without words, or at least I like to think that.
