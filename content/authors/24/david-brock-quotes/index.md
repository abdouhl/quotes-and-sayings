But I was much less interested in my own profile by that point, because I had already done that once, and it was not terribly fulfilling at the end of the day.''' ,'''Editors of conservative magazines aren't out trying to raise money. The money is there; the cash reserves are in the bank.''' ,'''When a political advocacy network hires a former CIA analyst and starts tailing save-our-parks activists, you know there's something terribly dangerous happening to our democracy.''' ,'''Hillary Clinton's loss has exposed the lack of Democratic power in this country at all levels.''' ,'''I became a conservative for the first dozen years of my professional life in Berkeley, Calif., and it was a reaction against political correctness, so I get it.''' ,'''When you imagine the Koch brothers, it's hard not to think of the 1983 film 'Trading Places,' which featured as its villains a pair of brothers, commodity brokers named Randolph and Mortimer Duke.''' ,'''Progressives are not going to give up on facts.''' ,'''I'm an incredibly hard worker, I'm incredibly tenacious, and I'm incredibly detail-oriented.''' ,'''It's very important to understand that the 'Talk' piece was not an excerpt, it was an adaptation, which means I compressed different parts of the book and made a new piece.''' ,'''Our nation marches closer to Trumpism each day, a path paved with reckless Tweets and the normalization of the ugly and the absurd.''' ,'''There's every financial incentive in the world to stay in the conservative movement forever.''' ,'''Money is money.''' ,'''I was one of the most visible and vocal advocates of Secretary Hillary Clinton.''' ,'''Eventually the story would spill over into the regular media.''' ,'''I made the apologies that needed to be made, and so I didn't feel that Media Matters was a continuing form of saying I was sorry.''' ,'''When it comes to Republican debates, fibs and fits come first; facts come last.''' ,'''Trump's rise to power, fueled by hatred and portending crisis, threatens to eviscerate our constitutional system of government.''' ,'''It's important to know where candidates for president are getting their ideas. Where do these ideas come from, who funds them and who is shaping our political discussion? These are all questions that are important to a healthy democracy.''' ,'''The Trump administration is shaping up to be one of the most corrupt since the Gilded Age.''' ,'''I want to have a media platform that is an honest broker and not just a mouthpiece for a political party.''' ,'''We all know liberals and Democrats who look down on certain people, and there is such a thing as P.C.''' ,'''You have to create public activist pressure on papers like the 'New York Times' to keep them accountable.''' ,'''Certainly going back to 2008 during the primary, Secretary Clinton was subjected to various forms of sexism - overt, subtle - that were detrimental.

We ought not tolerate either.''' ,'''At the end of the day, I think Donald Trump will be the great unifier of the Democratic Party.''' ,'''Criticizing Fox News has nothing to do with criticizing the press. Fox News is not a news organization. It is the de facto leader of the GOP, and it is long past time that it is treated as such by the media, elected officials and the public.''' ,'''Writing at the 'American Spectator' in the 1990s, we threw everything we thought would stick at President Clinton.''' ,'''I'm kind of a builder of institutions. I think I've got some ability to look at what's out here, look at a playing field, and identify gaps and niches.''' ,'''It's not a vast right-wing conspiracy. It's a right-wing conglomerate. It's more sophisticated, it's well-financed, it's well known.''' ,'''Trump apologized for nothing, including the horrible tape, right? No apology.''' ,'''During the '90s the flow of misinformation was established.''' ,'''We have a moral responsibility to stand up to Donald Trump, and that's what we're going to do.''' ,'''Ignorance can be improved; willful ignorance and inaction is inexcusable.''' ,'''It is an outrage that Donald Trump can swear and scream on national television and no one says boo about how he presents himself.''' ,'''The right can distort anything it wants.''' ,'''What led to my change of views about the Clintons was working through the research and writing on the book on Hillary.''' ,'''I'm a former, living, breathing, right-wing conspirator.''' ,'''Progressive politics in America is an organizational disaster.''' ,'''The press are animals, and they need to be treated that way.''' ,'''I think the Republicans are trying to learn from their mistakes about attacks on women because the women's vote will backfire.''' ,'''You never discount a demagogue.''' ,'''I've been interested in watching the level of conservative misinformation that circulates through the media.''' ,'''We who reject Trump's bankrupt leadership must heal old wounds, reorient ourselves, and embrace common goals.

I maintain some relationships with some conservatives going back to the 1990s... Not in any meaningful way.''' ,'''If you want to keep the relationships you have, it's best not to talk about them.''' ,'''Progressives want a different sort of media than what the Right wants.''' ,'''Once you apologize, then the press wants you to get down on your knees and say you're sorry.
