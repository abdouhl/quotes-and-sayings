- I want to get down to the nuts and bolts of what is actually going to change to lift New Zealand's economic performance.
- Socialism's not a word that I use. I say 'social democracy' because I don't think the government needs to own all the means of production.
- I've said in the primary race repeatedly that a Labour Party that I lead would be a true red Labour Party, be very clear about its social democratic roots and its social democratic agenda.
- I'm a big yachting fan.
- I support a constitutional conversation, as the Labour Party does, which will allow New Zealanders to evolve a more mature and stable constitutional form, but that's not something that I, as Labour Party, would want to impose, either on the party or on the public.
- I have picked the very, very best deputy that I could. David Parker is a fantastic guy. He's a person who I trust absolutely. He's got a wonderful sense for policy. He will be great on organisation, and I know that I could not have a better deputy.
- If there's a sustainable job that will create sustainable value, people will hire for it.
- I do not believe it is all about the leader. I think it's about the team, too. So we have one mission; we have one team; we are working to victory.
- I have never commented on a caucus issue or a shadow Cabinet issue, and I'm not about to start now.
- I think that's what all New Zealanders who are fair-minded want - a good chance for everybody to get ahead, whether it's education or housing.
- I've worked as a diplomat before I became a politician.
- I've been really clear that my first job as leader of the Labour Party and co-leader of the labour movement is to engage with our base.
