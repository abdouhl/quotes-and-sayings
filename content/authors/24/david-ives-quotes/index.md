- Plays are always about intense relationships, whether they're intense love relationships or family relationships or existential relationships.
- Lists are anti-democratic, discriminatory, elitist, and sometimes the print is too small.
- Necessarily, I'm always involved in casting, as any playwright is, because the whole process of putting on a play is a collaborative, organic effort on the part of a bunch of people trying to think alike.
- With my plays, when the lights go down, at least the audience isn't thinking, 'Oh, God, two more hours of this.'
- I think everything should be in verse. 'The New York Times' should be in verse.
- I admire pop songs that are perfect at three minutes.
- Writing a play, you start with less, so more is demanded of you. It's as if you have to not only write a symphony, but invent the instruments as well.
- Verse comedy is interesting to me because of the challenge of writing in rhymed couplets, which is not a form that's usually amenable to English, yet to me it gives great possibility for comedy.
