The room is cluttered with papers and books and gifts from friends.''' ,'''The writer's job is to let the books speak for themselves eventually.''' ,'''A good TV writer needs all the same tricks a good novelist has.''' ,'''In all honesty, my favorite place to write is an anonymous, cheap hotel in a city or town where nobody knows me, the wireless service is spotty, and the adjoining gas station has coffee, beer and junk food.''' ,'''Once I have a book in my head, I write progressive drafts fast and obsessively and have trouble sleeping.''' ,'''What a thrill it is to have my writing recognized by an institution as admirable and vital as the National Endowment for the Arts.''' ,'''In real life, I go to the North Shore with my kids for two weeks each summer, and it's a magical place for us.
