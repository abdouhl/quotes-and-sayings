- When I first signed on to play Tommen, I started speculating about when he was going to die. I sort of knew he wouldn't be the last one on the throne, but Tommen doesn't really deserve to have his throat slit or his stomach jabbed. In a way, Tommen died the way he was - it was a peaceful death.
- Normally, when my stuff's on the telly, I don't watch my own bits.
- When you're there and actually facing Natalie Dormer, it seems to go on for years.
- I like a good old thriller.
- Cats can't understand English, so you tell a cat, 'Come on. Jump on the bed,' and he just looks at you like, 'What are you talking about?'
- I think I'd want Tommen'to fight the Hound! And the Mountain! The Hound and the Mountain on one side, and Tommen on the other side. That would be so sick. Tommen would smash it!
- As an actor, I'd rather turn into Joffrey.
- That was the hardest thing for me. When it was published that I was going to play Tommen, all the fans of the books were like, 'Oh, he's turning 16' - that was the hardest thing: to play younger and show that.
