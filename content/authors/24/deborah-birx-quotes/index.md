What do I mean by that? There's certain - the outer coat, the envelope, and the inside part of the virus has stayed very constant.''' ,'''A company like Nike can convince people to buy Air Jordans even though they never saw Michael Jordan play.''' ,'''As soon as President Bush announced PEPFAR at the State of the Union, I had already been working in Africa for about five or six years.''' ,'''Whether you happen to be a gay man in Tanzania or someone who's imprisoned in Tanzania, it's your human right to have access to health care.''' ,'''I want to be incredibly clear: The United States stands for a public health approach to the HIV/AIDS pandemic.''' ,'''If you had a Starbucks that never sold coffee, you wouldn't keep the site open.
