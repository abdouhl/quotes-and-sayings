- Black films and television are growing and getting the recognition... and the opportunities.
- I want to impact some lives down the road, one by one, and I want people to look at my story and my life as an inspiration.
- I submerged myself in his life. Before I went to sleep at night, that's what I was watching. The videos would literally be going on while I was sleep; that's what I was hearing in my sleep. I woke up in the morning, Tupac.
- When I go places, I'm very much spotted, but I'm definitely ready for it and the opportunities it's going to bring.
- I'm ready for the opportunity to speak about things. I've always dreamed about the opportunity to speak about stuff.
- I don't have a huge acting background at all.
- In 10th grade, I was kicking it with the seniors. I introduced myself, and they were like, 'Yeah, Demetrius is cool, but we're gonna call you Pac.' That was it! It could be worse!
- I was working - just a regular working-class guy - but, at the same time, always aspired to do music.
- This is really honest: I have to remind myself not to look another black man as a threat.
- I was always critiquing my work. I let everybody else around - producers, directors, other actors - they give the nod of approval or the praise. Because I tried to always bring the best, so even if they were happy with it, I was still scrutinizing it.
- Whatever I do, I just want it to be good.
- Tupac was a person who was all about love. I feel like that's me, too; that's who I've always been.
- 'Dear Mama' is my favorite song from Tupac, man. It touches you, and I think that that's the most important thing with music.
- The one thing that I'm always gonna promote is, 'Don't look at a fellow black man as an enemy.' And it's hard. It's really hard, though, when you're coming up. It's something that you have to teach yourself and learn.
- Everybody has the Tupac that they admire. Certain people love the hip-hop person, the rapper. Strictly just the rapper. A lot of people, the newfound Tupac fans... they're into Death Row-era Tupac. But that was only nine months!
- I went to school in Long Beach, and all the seniors I used to kick it with called me Pac.
- There's so much black content on multiple platforms, and it's all getting great ratings. If you think about the Oscars snubbing 'Straight Outta Compton,' in a way, that kicked all of this off.
- I'm a strong believer in the things that I want to do.
- My father's relationship with Pac was something I was proud of.
- Acting opened me up.
- My fondest memory of Tupac is my father producing 'Toss It Up' for him when I was 7 years old and hearing that.
- Growing up, you hear Tupac's music, it's kind of like... it goes without saying that everyone likes Tupac.
- I just have to remember that everybody has their time.
- There aren't many people in the world that are as respected and loved when it comes to entertainment and as big as Pac. But the greatness that I adore the most is him as a man.
- I vowed to never be on camera down-talking another black man.
- If you want it, and you want to get it, then you've got to work hard for it, like Tupac was working hard for it.
- This is more in regards to celebrities. What we've got to understand is that we are the influencers of the hip-hop culture, the black culture. We are the way out, you feel what I'm sayin'? As far as who we look to and where we get stuff from - hip-hop culture is influencing the world, really, but especially the black communities.
- I definitely want to keep acting now. I've got all kinds of projects I want to do.
- I have to say that I'm a very passionate person.
- In high school, we would do improv. Me and my boy were, like, the stars of the class.
- Being on television is a little constraining. You spend six to eight months filming, and you get stuck in that gear. I feel like doing movies is a lot more my style.
- I will say this: Rapping-wise, there has never been anybody to match Tupac's energy when coming on a song, like when rappin'. It's unmatched. You can't duplicate it.
- He's a layered person, so you have to tackle all the aspects of Tupac individually.
- I want to be a part of bringing people together and sharing that love.
- I want to inspire people to do whatever they desire in life.
- Music is my passion. I've always been musically driven and musically inclined. I play the keyboard a little bit. I love listening to music and discovering music. That's my love, but I'm not a rapper at all.
