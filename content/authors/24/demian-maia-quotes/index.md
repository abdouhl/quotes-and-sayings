- All of my fights, I try to end the fight. That's my style.
- I felt when I was hitting guys or going for a takedown at 185, sometimes it was like hitting a wall.
- When you fight MMA, there are so many things involved, so many techniques, that you just can't do everything or you'll over-train.
- I'd like to be remembered for being the one responsible for adapting Brazilian jiu-jitsu for modern MMA. For what I've learned from fence work and some ground positions. Lots of details I developed after years and years studying them, testing what worked on the mat, against the fence, what kept opponents on the ground, control situations.
- Things can change quickly in the UFC. I lost to Nate Marquardt in my first loss as a middleweight and then I defeated Dan Miller and fought for the title against Anderson Silva.
- I'm really happy to be able to live my life doing what I love.
- In the 1930s, in boxing, to be the heavyweight champion of the world was really, really big, people wanted to see the toughest guys. But what I've figured out now, in the '50s, '60s, boxing started to become more entertainment than sport.
- When I started to strike a lot back in the days I lost a little bit my jiu-jitsu. It's normal.
- That's why I love jiu-jitsu, this is the best martial art in the world. It's an art that seeks the peace, to dominate your opponent.
- I think sometimes the fighters aren't very clear on things, and even myself, I'm a fighter, a lot of fighters make mistakes about working their image and how they market themselves.
- I don't sell myself. I am what I am. I'm a role model for a lot of people, for my kids. I don't want to just change because I want to make more money.
- That was my dream since I was a kid, since I first saw a vale tudo event in my hometown of Sao Paulo. I wanted to compete.
- There are lots of jiu-jitsu fighters who finish fights and have good MMA jiu-jitsu, but I think I've applied techniques which I can teach other people.
- I had my first professional fight was in 2001 in Venezuela - it was also my first international trip away from Brazil. It was a great experience. Then in 2005, I went to Finland and won. The next year there was a tournament in Brazil with three fights in one night. I was the underdog and won all three fights.
- Seminars, TV shows, documentaries, always spreading Brazilian jiu-jitsu. I'm an instrument of this art more than a character myself.
- When I watched the first fight between Woodley and Thompson, and I want to make clear that I really admire both guys, for me the fight was really boring at UFC 205 because nobody pulled the trigger for three rounds. The fourth round there was a scramble and that was really exciting, but then the fifth round was so-so again.
- I didn't choose this career for money. When I started training, I did it because I liked it, and I never had money for anything in my life.
- Everybody that I fight always avoids jiu-jitsu.
- I will always go for the submission instead of hurting my opponent.
- My wife never comes to watch me fight, she gets too nervous, so do my family. They will only watch it on the television after they know the outcome.
- When I see wrestlers fight, they train a lot of boxing because they don't want to end up on bottom.
- I'm a jiu-jitsu guy and that's my root.
- When I fight, nobody boos. Everybody likes it. Everyone cheers for me. I'm happy about that, because I'm one of the guys who is putting the grappling and jiu-jitsu on the level where people are interested in the technique. I can get people excited about it.
- When you get asked if you want the title, you really need to push for that. That's why I want to do it my style, not do it so loud, but I want to fight for the title.
- I'm sure about my style. I always go to fight. I always go to be aggressive.
- I went to college. I did that but I worked at the same time, and I trained.
- I believe in my jiu-jitsu.
- I come to grapple.
- For the title, if they say, 'Ok, let's sit and wait,' I will sit and wait because I know it's a once in a lifetime opportunity.
- I know my jiu-jitsu is good enough to beat the best guys in the world.
- Everything I did in my life was about the title, but that's too much pressure over me. When I relaxed more, even my performance became better.
- Striking isn't just about kicking and punching. It's far more complex than that. It's also about timing and range.
- Marketing is everything.
- When I got into UFC, it was an unbelievable feeling. When I got inside the cage, 'Big' John McCarthy - a guy who I was watching back when Royce Gracie was fighting - was the referee. I was able to earn a quick submission win. It was perfect.
- People always go to the ground with me trying to just hold me. They stall and wait for the referee to stand them back up so they can start it all over.
- I'm not going to sell myself just because I want to be a champion, just because I want to make more money, you know?
- I cannot forget my roots. That's what helps me win fights.
- I started training judo when I was 5 years old. I didn't know much. My mom just took me and my brother to do some judo because we were very energetic. We did that for a couple of years. I don't know why we stopped, but I came back to try other forms of martial arts like kung fu and karate when I was 12 and never stopped.
- The striking game is always a lottery game, so I prefer to take the safe situation. Submission is the best for me. I'm the guy looking for it all the time.
- Jiu-jitsu teaches you not to hurt your opponent, and that's inside of me.
- MMA's not like a game like basketball, for example, that if you're winning by 30, 40 points and there's just five minutes left, you can do whatever you want because the guy isn't going to beat you. In MMA, you can get beaten in the last minute of the fight, or the last second of the fight, so sometimes you've got to be safe.
- I always try and use my jiujitsu to win fights. That's my favorite method of securing victory.
- It's hard to be in the UFC one year.
- MMA is pretty tough on your mind because it's a sport that's not just about winning. You really want to win bad, but it's tough when you lose. You get beaten. And it really messes with your ego, because nobody wants to get beaten by other people physically. It's not just a game. You get beaten physically.
- Jiu-jitsu fighters usually have an advantage in longer fights even though MMA has breaks between rounds.
- You can't compare my background to the Gracies', not only in technique, but in terms of business and marketing.
- I had good teachers and I loved to compete in jiu-jitsu. I was doing good, a world champ, but I always knew I wanted to fight.

- I want to show in a violent sport like our sport, you don't need to hurt anybody in order to win.
- It's obvious that I want to reach Cerrone's win record, I know that's important for my career. Those milestones last forever, even if someone passes you later, they are forever.
- Fights are fights. It's a cliche, but it's true, you can never know how they'll go down for sure until you do it.
- The day I stop aiming for the title, I will stop fighting.
- You can trade money for other good things and that's nice, but it's not the first thing that matters to me. I'm a martial artist and I have other priorities.
- Chael is a pretty tough and strategic opponent and very hard to put down.
- Grappling is my style.
- I think I've already won the most important titles in Brazilian jujitsu and grappling.
- A lot of people love what I do and a lot of people don't like or hate my style, so it's external - I really don't care about that. I'm happy with the people that appreciate it, but I'm not unhappy with the people that don't like it.
- I'm a very competitive type, so I want to win the fight first of everything.
- Fights are all about styles and matchups.
- Jiu-jitsu is very 'democratic,' it does not matter how you are physically - it is all about your mind, and a lot of technique.
- Don't get me wrong - I love going to academy every day and training as hard as I can; I love to learn. But I have other plans. When you are in the UFC, you gotta save 80 percent of your time for that. I want to do other nice stuff, other things that give me pleasure also.
- Sometimes I don't talk too much, that's myself, but I truly believe I can be the champion. I feel, I can visualize that.

- To me, when you're not as hungry to train hard and learn new things and get better as you once were, I think it's time to stop.
- I lived in Barueri for a long time, and now I live in a city close to Barueri, so it's like my backyard.
- I think I adapted well for MMA.
- I know I have a lot of fans, and it's a big mistake try to please everybody.
- Anytime a guy asks to compete against you, they usually think they have the advantage.
- I've been in this position before when you never lose, when your record is clear, people are avoiding you.
- A loss is horrible, and it's even worse in the UFC.
- I know my mission is not just to be a champion, I mean, being champion would be great and I want to be one, but it's not under my control, you know.
- The difference between me and other black belts is that I truly believe that jujitsu can be used in all aspects of MMA, because it was created to do that. If you train hard, it will work.
- Any man can be defeated.
- If we fought like the old days, with no time limit, it would be better to work. We only have five minutes to work per round so it's complicated, especially because everybody knows that my ground game is good.
- Submitting is always the most important thing to me. Victory first, but with a submission is what I always want.
- My jiu-jitsu is very good, and anytime I'm able to show what my coaches and my team are capable of doing, I really enjoy it.
- A lot of people underestimate Jake Shields, but his results speak for themselves. He's tough to beat.
- When I was 16, we get kicked out of our house because my mother and my father were separated, so we didn't have money to pay. We got kicked out and had to live with my grandmother, sleeping in the living room, for many years.
- Sonnen, to me, he's a great athlete, but he created that image so much for himself that people don't think he's that good. They just think he talks. So I think it's a risk you run when you do that.

- I was always very, very focused, just thinking about the title.
- I need to improve my striking and my wrestling, but I always be best at jiu-jitsu.
- I don't like winning in a violent way.
- I was never a playboy, you know? But it's easy to say that because it's just a stereotype. 'OK, this boy did college so he must be a playboy.'
- My loss to Marquardt was just one of those things. I made a mistake and got caught. I think I had a lot more to offer in that fight, but he caught me before I had a chance to show it.
- I will fight everywhere, but I trust a lot on my jiu-jitsu.
- People learn. If you market somebody, let's say GSP, a lot of people were saying he was doing boring fights because he was taking the guys down and controlling them, but he was winning, and he was the guy who selling the most.
- Playboy in Brazil is like a rich boy, but I've never been a rich boy. My family is not rich. Actually, I help all my family.
- I always try to improve my stand-up game, it's very important for me.
- Everybody has their own opinions and you cannot please everybody. I'm never going to try to do that - to please everybody - because there is always somebody who will say they don't like it.
- I have my principles. I'd rather die than change my principles.

If he has a good right hand or a good kick or good submissions then I'll try to avoid that, but I like to be in a fight and I like to go into the fight.
