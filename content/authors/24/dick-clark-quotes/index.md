- I played records, the kids danced, and America watched.
- It's real good to be back with you again this year.
- I've never relegated the lip-synch to a lower form of entertainment. Lip-synching is an art unto itself. A lot of people can't do it.
- Music is the soundtrack of your life.
- I don't set trends. I just find out what they are and exploit them.
- I was roundly criticized for being in and around rock & roll music at its inception. It was the devil's music: it would make your teeth fall out and your hair turn blue, whatever the hell. You get through that.
- I keep everything. It's one of my problems. I'm a saver.
- In Presley's time, you didn't dare not to be a fan of his, because you were part of a club. Now you can say I prefer Billy Joel or Tina Turner or someone else. It's all fractionalized.
- Two-thirds of people with diabetes don't realize the seriousness that it can cause their hearts. They don't realize they can have a stroke, drop dead of a heart attack. So you've got to get this thing under control.
- I adhere to my exercise program, which is about 20 minutes a day. I do it seven days a week. I have a little stall in the breezeway of our garage where I have a walking machine, a stair climber, and I do 15 pound weights, and I watch television. Because I hate exercise.
- I have accomplished my childhood dream: to be in show business. Everybody should be so lucky to have their dreams come true. I've been truly blessed.

- My father said to me at one time, 'If you are still a disc jockey by the time you are 30, you better find another line of work.' Little does he realize, I am in my 70s, and I still do seven or eight hours of radio every day - or every week.

- Between Alan Freed in Cleveland and Bob Horn and Lee Stewart in Philadelphia and George 'Hound Dog' Lorenz in Buffalo, they began to find out that white kids liked black music. It was a very significant period of time before I got there.
- Rock had a huge impact. Anything that the older generation hates is usually loved by kids. Nothing much changes - that still continues today.
- Now that we've got computers, you can pump up anything that anybody ever uttered.
- First job I had, I was 17 years old. I was primarily the mail room boy at the radio station. An FM station. And in those days, nobody listened to FM.
