- It's not about how big or expensive a present is, it's the thought that is so nice.
- I write a lot about other people, like family and friends. I look at their lives and relationships and think, 'Well, if I was in your position, this is how I would see it.'
- Everyone told me I could sing from about the age of ten. My mum was always telling me. But I was so shy, I didn't believe them. And the more that people told me, the more I went into the background and the less likely I was to sing.
- I found songwriting really hard at first, but after a while it was actually very easy.
- It's not about being thin, it's about being healthy. And when you are a child you like to eat all these unhealthy things like chocolate and sweets. Oh my God. I love strawberries dipped in chocolate and Lion bars and Toffee Crisps - and as you grow up, you have to learn that those things are only good in moderation or you will become very fat.
- I'm not a wannabe Miley Cyrus.
- I love heels. I remember the first time I saw a pair of heels my mum said: 'You're not wearing those. They're too high!'
- At one of my old schools, I didn't tell anyone I was doing my first album because I was worried they'd be like, 'Who does she think she is?' So I just let them find out for themselves.
- The papers are only going to show what they want the readers to see. It's all propaganda, to be honest.
- My first album done what it had to do. It introduced me.
- Most of my songs aren't about me. They're about stuff I've seen.
- If I'm naughty, I'm grounded for two weeks or Mum takes my phone and my laptop because she knows I can't live without them. Sometimes I'll say, 'Mum, do you just want to take my laptop?' because I can still use the Internet on my phone. But now she's going to read this and see what I've been doing.
- Twitter's a funny one. I mean, it's good in some respects, but I can't stand it in other respects. You know there are too many opinions, people get opinions mixed up, and people get being rude mixed up with 'that's my opinion.'
- Not only is fur cruel, it's also totally gross. I mean, who wants to wear the skin of an abused animal? Not me!
- I like watching 'The X Factor,' but I would never go on it - I think it's too much of a controlled thing.
- I really love Juicy Couture - it's young and fresh.
- I'd love to design stuff that I'd like to wear and that other people could wear, too.
- One Direction are super cool.
- I used to like the Jonas Brothers, but only because I thought that they were good-looking, not because I actually liked their music.
- I wouldn't say my mother was my best friend, because that sounds odd, but we have a really tight bond and she is my friend on Facebook. Although she only goes on it to check up on me and sometimes we argue about it.
- My mum wants the best for me. And I like having my mum around me.
- I found songwriting really hard at first, but after a while it was actually very easy. I wrote about everyday stuff.
