That's what's important to me.''' ,'''Not that I'm in the stage of my career where they're offering me parts in 'The Revenant,' but I try very hard to go through the audition process because I feel like I learn quite a lot about the character and the people I'm going to work with.''' ,'''As far as being locked into one certain thing, that's not what I want to do. I just want the opportunity to go off and do something else, whether it's plays or musicals or whatever.''' ,'''I've always said from starting off, 'I don't mind if I'm in a big budget film or a huge play or something small in London playing for 50 people, as long as I'm doing what I love doing for a living.'''' ,'''I don't have any angel blood, as far as I know.''' ,'''My agents and my managers are very good at whittling things down to the things they think I would be good at and that I'd respond well to, and that includes theater, TV and film. Whatever it is, if the material is right for me, then I'll go for it.''' ,'''I became an actor because I enjoy playing a variety of different people rather than playing one person for the rest of my career.''' ,''''Twilight' is very different to the 'Vampire Academy,' completely.''' ,]
