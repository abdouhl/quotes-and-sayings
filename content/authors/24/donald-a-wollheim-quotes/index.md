quotes = ['''While the circumnavigation of the solar system seems farfetched, it may not be once the problem of effective anti-gravitational control is solved.''' ,'''Once solved, the severe handicaps imposed on space exploration by the weight and chemical limitations of rockets would no longer apply.
