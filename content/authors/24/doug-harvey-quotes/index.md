- The part of the game that fans will soon miss: the argument between manager and umpire!

So, I got to be about 13 years of age when finally she quit spanking on me. But I think that it was great way to be raised.

- I say to you, you want a thrill, volunteer to be an umpire. I'd like you to go just work the bases some day. Just go do that. You're going to love it. Try the slow-pitch stuff. You'll love it. Ask my son - he tried it! He said, 'I've never seen so many idiots in all my life.'
- If you're a photographer, they give you a camera. If you're a writer, they give you a typewriter. If you're an umpire, they give you an unseen object and they call it a strike zone, and nobody seems to agree with you no matter what you call.
- You can't know what it's like to be a major league umpire unless you were a major league umpire.
