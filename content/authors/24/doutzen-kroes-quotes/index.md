- When I am with my mum, I am happiest and healthiest. She always taught me how to eat healthily. She always cooked from the garden, and it was always organic.
- If I've been working a lot and I've been away from my kids, then I don't go to the gym. It's okay to miss a day. I tell myself not to feel bad about it, too, because then it's a waste if you choose not to do something and feel bad.
- It's important sometimes to have pictures that are not as retouched and show more of the real skin.
- Sometimes it's a struggle to keep up with my own photos, where the lighting is perfect, the makeup is done, and the images have been retouched. That's not what I see when I look in the mirror!
- I love green juices.
- I'm a big French fry girl. I try to avoid them, but sometimes you just need to indulge, so I go for it!
- My mom and dad both would grow vegetables. So, when I delivered my baby, we went there, and she would cook a lot, and we would eat all the vegetables from their garden.
- I don't always feel sexy even though I have to look it, and I've just learned to go into on-and-off mode. I'm a mom at home, and then I go into work, and it's nice to have that contrast. I see a different person in the mirror when I'm at work with hair and makeup than when I'm home.
- I know it's a cliche, but the sun makes me happy. When you can feel the sunshine on you, you feel better, happier, and naturally, every human being needs the sun.
- In any job, you have to give up certain things, and I believe that having a good quality of life means enjoying certain things only in moderation.
- Ahead of going on the red carpet, in the morning, I'll put on a clay mask to prepare.
- I've biked my whole life. We didn't have bus service when I was going to school in Holland, so I biked around 25 kilometers to school every day.
- I feel like it's always important to curl your eyelashes. I always do when I wake up and you know you look tired, when you curl eyelashes and put mascara it makes such a huge difference, so that's the trick that I always use.
- Drink a lot of water, wear big sunglasses, and don't wear make-up on the flight.
- I am able to really enjoy the positive attention I receive.
- I am definitely a summer person. Don't get me wrong: I love winter when it's beautiful and sunny - I don't really care about cold - I just hate the grey.
- If I really don't feel like it, I'll change my plans and choose to be with my baby. If that moment makes me happier, I think that's more important.
- I maintain a healthy lifestyle all year round for my job, but I definitely try to eat extra clean the night before a shoot and make sure to fit in a workout so that I feel my best.
- I wanted to become a teacher, like my mother, or a charity worker. But my mom says that when I was younger, I told her, 'People are going to know me,' so I guess I always had that idea.
- I feel I'm such a big part of that insecurity that some girls might have because of my job, that girls think they have to be that picture. And even boys, they think that that picture exists, and it's so frustrating because I don't look like that picture - I wake up not looking like that picture.
- I've always known that beauty is also from the inside - if you're happy, that will shine through - I've always believed that, but since I've started having a family, I became even more happy, and I think it even shows more. I've also become more successful since I've become a mother.
- I think the most important thing is to always clean your face and ensure your make-up comes off at night. Going to bed with make-up is just so bad for your skin.
- I've realized that I really like spending time in the countryside and having a garden.
- Growing up in the north of Holland, I had a healthy and balanced diet.
- I take really good care of my body.
- I want to work, but the balance to find between working and being a mom is challenging.
- With kids, I have less time for things like masks - though I do try to treat myself, after they've gone to bed, to a mask or something. It's kind of funny because, as you get older, you probably need to do more in terms of beauty, but actually, you have less time to do it. But becoming a mother has made me a stronger person.
- Sometimes when I pose for pictures, people say it's impossible that I have a flat stomach without working out like crazy and having a personal trainer, and sometimes they get mad at me, and I find that hard because I think there's a lot of women who have the same thing happening to them because they lived a healthy, active lifestyle.
- You only hear the horror stories - that after a baby, you never get your body back - but it's not true; it depends on your life beforehand.
- I like to take care of myself and know what foods I should be eating.
