You here less about Canadian actresses than actors, I don't know why.''' ,'''Ever since I was a little kid, I always dreamed of being a Big City kid, because I grew up in a very small town up north in Canada.

I like hockey, I love it, but I'm not an avid hockey - let's face it, true Canadian - fan. I've always been more into snowboarding and skateboarding and sort of the alternative sports, I'm not crazy about hockey - but love it!''' ,'''It's like Canada is the little brother to the United States and one day they are going to show the world they're just as cool as their successful big brother.''' ,'''I was always kind of a loudmouth and a class clown, and that kind of led to doing all the school plays and trying out all kinds of different stuff.''' ,'''I have this recurring nightmare where I'm giving a speech in front of my old high school classmates, and they start laughing at me, and I look down and realize I'm naked. And a shark.''' ,'''My whole life, growing up, I always wanted to be in comedy. I never felt comfortable doing the 'teen hunk' thing.''' ,]
