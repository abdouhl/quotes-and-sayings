- I'm a huge 'Indiana Jones' fan.
- I feel like I'm good with girls. I understand them and am good at loving them. I've always felt like that's been natural for me.
- I'd like to get into some sort of workout regimen so I can properly be healthy and exercise like a normal human being. I seem to not do that... ever.
- My first semester of college, I'm going to sociology and English and psychology, and all I cared about was getting home and preparing for whatever audition I had.
- Sometimes I'd literally show up at the gym having a panic attack, and my trainer would be like, 'All right, let's just go get breakfast.' I can't give enough credit to him... he was really there for me, and not just like a trainer where it's like, 'Well, come on, man, I gotta pump you up.' He cared more about my mind and the state that I was in.
- You have to latch onto somebody while you're working.
- Having a connection and chemistry with a director is really key.
- Just going out and seeing friends, not being cooped up in my house because I don't want to get my picture taken or anything like that - I've tried to let go of that stuff a bit, accept that it's going to happen to me, and not let it prevent me from doing anything I want to do, which I have in the past.
- I've always wanted to do action movies.
- Stiles is a version of me that rarely exists in the real world. He's so confident and extroverted, and I'm much more restrained and internal.
- You never want to pull any punches. You want that stuff to be as real and as vicious as possible.
- I'm never offered any sort of roles. I need to audition in a typically lengthy process to receive roles.
- I learned a lot about a traumatic situation and what it does to you. It really brings you closer to your family and your loved ones.
- My heroes are guys like Tom Hanks, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Matt Damon. These are amazing actors with amazing careers that every actor should aspire to. I'm not saying I'm going to get anywhere close. It's not going to be an easy feat. I'm just in awe of their careers.
- You always have the nightmare of, you know, working with the guy that you've just admired forever, and then he's just totally disengaged and awful to be around.
- Part of growing up is realizing you learn to love so many people. It's about forming those relationships and finding what will last forever.
- I'm still on the ground, so I just do my thing.
- When I was 17, I was about 5'6''.
- I was in school, but I wasn't into school. I wasn't doing what I wanted to be doing in school, which was film studies. That was what I intended on doing, but I didn't go away to a university because I wanted to stay in L.A. and audition while I took classes, so I elected to go to a community college and just take G.E. courses. It was terrible.
- Growing up, I was in love with Jennifer Aniston from 'Friends.'
- I can't say enough about 'The First Time.' It was such an awesome experience. Jon Kasdan, the writer/director, was great. He's such a talented guy who's really, truly special.
- I love baseball - 'Moneyball' was my favorite book when I was 13.
- In regard to performing, it couldn't be funnier that I ended up being an actor, because I'm really shy. Unless I'm really comfortable with a person.
- I haven't worked with a director who is a crazy person at all.
- I didn't have that many friends my first few years of high school. It was very cliquey and I'm super shy, so it was hard to make friends.
- I've always wanted to play Peter Parker, obviously.
- I always assume that a chick is not into me. So it's never natural for me to be like, 'Check out that girl in the corner. She's waiting for me to come up to her. I'm gonna to work my six-step process...'
- I love sprinting, but I hate long-distance running. Isn't that funny?
- I still remember when I was 18 and my life was completely different. I was in my apartment, and I got the call that I got Stiles for this pilot. I was just jumping around with my roommates, freaking out. It's crazy to think about.
- I really try to live my life a little more, in ways I would hold back from previously.
- I think there's something to be said about pacing yourself.
- I've never looked at myself as this pop candy type.
- We were walking through Petco Park after a signing, and this girl plowed through security and grabbed onto my neck and started pulling. Her grip was so impressively strong that this huge security guard was struggling to get her off of me. I was like, 'Whoa. That's kind of crazy.'
- Michael's great. He's everything you'd want Michael Keaton to be.
- If you're proud of something, and if you're proud of your work at the end of the day, the experience, walking away, you can feel good about it; that's what you have to focus on.
- The perfect date is the one where anything and everything goes wrong, but at the end of it, all you want is to see them again.
- When a chick has a sense of humor, there's nothing more attractive.
- If you have a good thing going behind the scenes, you'll have a good thing going on-screen.
- I never have an opinion about clothes and know nothing about fashion.
- As an actor, you blindly put your trust in experts - and if they tell you something's safe, you don't fully vet it yourself. If you're young and inexperienced, that's just what you're taught to do.
- When I was younger, I used to just want to please everybody and not want to be an issue or not be considered a diva. I've just grown up and realized you have to look out for yourself and stick up for yourself, and there's nothing wrong with that.
- It's kind of too generic, a male lead.
- I'll always be reading a good book. I don't have, like, specific genre tastes or anything or things that I kind of get hooked on, reading genre books or anything like that. It's just really anything anyone kind of recommends or is going around or I hear is good.
- I'll never be, at least in my mind, as cool as Jason Bourne.
- I just want to work with good filmmakers and do good projects that mean something to me and play interesting characters. That's really it.
- It's honestly just pressure that I put on myself when I'm working. It's just how I operate.
- I'm very shy. I wish more people believed me when I say that.
- It makes it easier to adapt a book that is popular with kids because of how excited they are about the project; you don't get the criticisms you would get with other projects.
- I'm nervous and awkward.
- I'm always a little innately shy when I first talk to a girl, and I think I always will be! But I think that's a good thing. You don't want to lose that.
- I can run pretty quick.
- I really just want to work with good directors and learn as much as I possibly can.
- Honestly, man, I'm not somebody who wants the celebrity. I could really care less about that stuff. I know everyone says it, but I get overwhelmed by it all sometimes.
- In 'Teen Wolf,' I don't really have any stunts. And if I do, it's like Stiles falls on the ground or something like that.
- To me, the 'Maze Runner' fans have been so supportive of everything I have done.
- There's just something awesome about going all-out for 20 seconds and then stopping and getting to guzzle Pedialyte.
- If I did want to get a girl's attention, it would just be in some way where I would just start talking to her. It would have to feel organic. It's too weird otherwise.
- I have a personality type, but it's not like I'm like, 'Oh yeah, short and brunette. That's what I like. All the time.'
- I don't really give much thought to the roles that I'd ideally love to play.
- It's really easy sometimes to get comfortable on a set and get into the groove and think it's all make-believe so nothing bad can happen.
- Kissing on screen is just - funny enough, you're just acting, so you're distracted by that more than anything. Or at least I am.
- It's always a long process of trying to suppress the self-doubt on set when you're acting.
- Yeah, I've only been acting since I was 18 out of high school.
- I just really like fun, cool, interesting, quirky girls. And sometimes you find that in 6'2 model bodies and sometimes they're short and brunette. All shapes and sizes - it's really about the personality. That sounds cliche, but it's so freaking true!
- 'Teen Wolf' ending is, like, huge. I know no acting without the show, basically.
- With TV, you just have to finish the days and get the episodes out. And it's always going to be an impossible schedule. That's the funny thing with TV that not a lot of people realize.
- I'm excited to see what comes my way, see what I'm interested in next, and just see what happens.
- You don't disrupt genius at work.
- It's a generational thing. It'd be great if some kids grew up with me as that Jason Bourne figure.
- I always whip up chicken cutlets or something. Or I make chicken parm and pasta, or something like that.
- The physical part was one thing. Whatever - I broke my face; that'll heal. The mental aspect was the biggest shock to the system. You just don't know how to experience stuff like that. You don't have any control over it, either. It's just how your body and brain reacts to something like that happening.
- The thing I like a lot about acting is I'll never learn enough. I'll never know it inside and out.
- The 'Maze Runner' family, we all just really genuinely love each other.
- I'm a big root beer guy.
- I moved to California when I was twelve and I got a video camera and made little movies because I didn't have any friends yet. I would force my sister to make these movies with me - which became my YouTube channel.
- I just happened to step into acting. And now I can't imagine myself doing anything else.
- I want to work with filmmakers who are really smart.
- In high school, girls started wearing high-waisted pants with their shirts tucked into them. I don't get what that's about.
