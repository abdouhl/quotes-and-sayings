Recognizing and treasuring the contributions of older people is essential to the long-term flourishing of any society.''' ,'''Human rights will be a powerful force for the transformation of reality when they are not simply understood as externally defined norms of behavior but are lived as the spontaneous manifestation of internalized values.''' ,'''No one can live entirely on their own, nor can any country or society exist in isolation.''' ,'''The gratification of desire is not happiness.''' ,'''I firmly believe that the mission of religion in the 21st century must be to contribute concretely to the peaceful coexistence of humankind.''' ,'''Dialogue and education for peace can help free our hearts from the impulse toward intolerance and the rejection of others.''' ,'''Having lived through the transition from totalitarianism, I am acutely mindful of the need to never take for granted the basic freedoms of thought, expression and belief that democracy brings.''' ,'''A healthy vision of the future is not possible without an accurate knowledge of the past.''' ,'''Faced with stress, too many people feel they have nowhere to turn to, that they don't have access to the kind of friendships or communities where they can easily and openly share their problems and worries.''' ,'''The effects of human rights education can be dramatic in awakening people to the value and power of their own lives, as shown in the following stories.''' ,'''Leadership that exploits and sacrifices young people on the altar of its goals is nothing more than raw, demonic power.

While arrogant intellect seeks to control and manipulate the world, the poetic spirit bows with reverence before its mysteries.''' ,'''Poems and songs penned as an unstoppable outpouring of the heart take on a life of their own. They transcend the limits of nationality and time as they pass from person to person, from one heart to another.''' ,'''No one is born hating others.''' ,'''History is filled with tragic examples of wars that result from diplomatic impasse.

Not even tragic accident or disaster can destroy such treasures of the heart.''' ,'''But I believe we must not allow feelings of defeat to take root in our hearts.''' ,'''Genuine happiness can only be achieved when we transform our way of life from the unthinking pursuit of pleasure to one committed to enriching our inner lives, when we focus on 'being more' rather than simply having more.''' ,'''Since ancient times, people from throughout Asia have brought to Japan their talents, knowledge and energy, helping to lay the basis for Japan's existence as a country.''' ,]
