quotes = ['''I often think that the Greatest Generation gave birth to the Crappiest Generation, the stinky hippies with their slacktivism and demand for government welfare in the name of freedom.''' ,'''The Left has done a remarkable job marketing themselves as being the party for minorities when every single policy they put forth, from education to employment, has done more to harm these communities than to help.''' ,'''If we don't want intrusive government, then we need to care for the least among us so that they are not exploited as a reason by the government for bigger government.''' ,'''The pay gap has nothing to do with employer discrimination; it has to do with choice. Let's employ a little common sense: statistically, women are the likely of a family to forego a career for more time with the family, and maybe it's because they want to.''' ,'''I can't count a single conservative of my acquaintance that doesn't include charitable work in their list of priorities.''' ,'''Where's the CNN town hall for sanctuary cities?''' ,'''On my show, I often discuss all the ways one can get involved politically on a local level, precincts, et al.''' ,'''Beta males and females historically fare poorly in anchor positions, and whoever has the dominate, or more alpha, personality will always win out in spoken word count simply because they don't wait for an opening.''' ,'''Palin may be a polarizing figure, but she's more than just a 'political personality.'''' ,'''We are all people who have messed up. I fall short every single day.''' ,'''The beauty of the tea party movement is that it is independent and thus a true check and balance of the Republican and Democrat parties. It's not a pawn of the GOP, thus untouchable in criticism of the Democrats - I view it as an unattached conscience of the Republican party.''' ,'''The biggest threats to faith aren't anything outside of it: they come bearing the name. It's why I find it especially important to call it out - also why I find it especially repulsive when people who crow the loudest about being Christians and use it as a money-making scheme utterly betray the faith when not on camera or in a crowd.''' ,'''If you cannot commit several hours per week to maintain the liberty that others afforded you, then you, by your inaction and silent voice, abet those who seek to destroy it.''' ,'''It's not the United States's job to 'protect' Islam.''' ,'''I'm a weensy-government conservative from the Midwest, Christian, mother of two, homeschooler, and my hobby, profession, and passion is news.''' ,'''I've blogged since 2001 and was first attracted to the medium by its wild-west aesthetic, if simply telling the truth that corporate media wasn't telling could be so rebellious as to be defined as 'wild west.'''' ,'''People always choose self-preservation over the greater good, most of the time, with the belief that self-preservation is the greater good.''' ,'''Don't do anything to upset the victimhood apple cart, because then young women may want to think for themselves, and the entire racket of feminism ran by women who butter their bread by playing Chicken Little to the subsequent generation would be penniless.''' ,'''Art can be political, but when it becomes politicized, the purity is ruined.''' ,'''I was at St. Louis's very first tea party and stood across the mighty Mississippi on the Arch steps with a bunch of wide-eyed, virgin protesters who were just as shocked as I was to see the amount of people who had assembled.''' ,'''The most dangerous thing a member of Congress could do is to ignore the citizenry who have taken up the mantle of reporting since they weren't getting the truth from the co-opted mainstream outlets.''' ,'''Conservatism, when presented in full strength at the ballot, wins at the ballot.''' ,'''The privilege of a free society is that every man, woman, and child has the opportunity - and the obligation as a free people - to determine the trajectory of their country, of a political race.''' ,'''We are all sinners.''' ,'''I'm a Christian, a wife, a mother, a homeschooler, a conservative, a citizen journalist, a talk radio host, an insatiable music nerd who plays a poor rhythm guitar, a blogger, a proud granddaughter of a sailor, and a proud tea partier in awe of the potential and the people in this movement.''' ,'''As a kid spending weekends in the Ozarks, I remember my granny's preacher shaking his fist, his jowls waving in the wind not unlike a bloodhound's, excoriating the congregation and condemning it to hell.''' ,'''I don't know if I ever believed in the infallibility of a journalist's objectivity, but I definitely stopped flirting with the notion as a young adult.''' ,'''Even if feminists tear down the bogeyman patriarchy and dominate men in all areas of life, they still won't be happy because deep down, they'll know it's a false victory. Achievement obtained by lowering your opponent to your standard as opposing to rising and surpassing their standard of output isn't achievement. It's mediocrity.''' ,'''The most misreported and misunderstood thing about the tea party is its political leanings. The tea party has no political leaning. It stands straight for limited government, low taxes, and liberty for all.''' ,'''Our Founding Fathers, regular men who did great things together, established this system along with other regular men.''' ,'''Liberal talk on the radio doesn't perform well because it is not a sequestered to a niche - it's everywhere in the media universe. Conservative talk radio, on the other hand, performs well because the radio is the only place, besides Fox News, that people can go for right-sphere opinions.''' ,'''The fallout from Wikileaks is incomparable to 9/11, the U.S.S. Cole, numerous embassies, et al.''' ,'''It's difficult to expect kids not to bully one another when they don't have many examples otherwise in society.''' ,'''Judges are either partial to the Constitution or they aren't; they either believe that the document is perfect in its form and that rights like free speech don't ebb in and out of style - or they believe that it's an anachronistic document in a world that needs a malleable, living Constitution.''' ,'''What battle has ever been won by staying in camp and talking to your fellow soldier?''' ,'''Too many people on the Left think that, when you move a chunk of money away from people for entitlements, that the money magically reappears and that discretionary spending will be unaffected.''' ,'''We can't disrespect, by way discounting or misunderstanding our different sticking points, the beliefs of the various groups comprising the tea party movement, but we all have more in common with each other than we do with factions on the Left: the communists, the socialists, the say-they're-anarchists-but-are-actually-socialists.''' ,'''I take gun rights very personally.''' ,'''My grandfather served as a gunner aboard the U.S.S. Alabama in the Pacific theater during WWII.''' ,'''The brilliance of Andrew Breitbart is that he has created thousands of Andrew Breitbarts.''' ,'''The Left puts their stock in substance and lives on identity and figureheads. It will be the end of the Right to do the same.''' ,'''Most evangelical Christian conservatives I know would at least be uneasy about the prospect of the government picking up the slack of caring for the poor due to Christians' abdication of their role in society as dictated by Scripture.''' ,'''Faith without works is dead just as a movement without works is also dead.''' ,'''My particular rule of thumb is to allow disruptors to let their flags fly.

Such a struggle is not a burden, it is a privilege.''' ,'''You can have a good time and kick some butt - they're not mutually exclusive.''' ,'''Each justice enters the Supreme Court possessing a record of opinion by which he or she is measured, and that without threat of election or outside influence, they will apply the Constitution as they always have; thus, it's ridiculous to assert the opposite.''' ,'''The NAACP ignores the wellspring of racism from within its own ranks, daring to brand anyone who disagrees with the standard they bear for the plantation-politics Democrats as 'white nationalists.'''' ,'''If equal pay is that important to you, stay a single, unmarried woman. It's not the employer's responsibility to make up for the free choices of its employees made on the employees' free and private time.''' ,'''Conservatives are either stupid or brilliant. Pick a narrative, leftist MSM. You can't have it both ways.''' ,'''The tea party wants to empower people with opportunity and the freedom for the individual to pursue success and keep the fruits of their success.''' ,'''When taxes go up, tithing goes down. When the government assumes the role of the shepherd, the power of churches is diminished. It's another way to attack religion and for the state to eradicate it from society.''' ,'''My faith, my family, my friends - that's where I get my strength.''' ,'''Bureaucrats want you to think that the system is too complex because they want you to be stupid about it and uninterested in it. They work very hard to create as many levels as possible away from the simplistic government our Founding Fathers formed for one simple reason: they don't want you to know what they are doing.''' ,'''The Democratic party, respective to health care, is like a person who was sent into the store to purchase a gallon of milk and some butter for the evening's meal and instead walked out with a 'Gladiator' DVD, a can of Easy Cheese, and some Homer Simpson house slippers because how funny are they?''' ,'''Elected office was never intended to become its own industry; it was to be filled with common men who, by way of still having jobs and families back home, maintained the connection to the problems of average, everyday people and thus could better serve.''' ,'''Evil is real.''' ,'''People like me who are here in flyover country, we're tired of East Coast moderates.''' ,'''The difference between Koppell and Olberman types is that one gives editorializing in all its editorial frankness so there are no mistakes as to bias, and the other passes off a subtler bias as objectivity.''' ,'''I think that God has blessed each of us with innate gifts, and if I've demonstrated any ability to not stick my foot in my mouth on air or in the written word, then I will take that and stand for liberty on the right side of God.''' ,'''The Gen X generation never got past 'Reality Bites,' apparently, and my generation, the Gen Yers... Facebook? Maybe a conservative revolution?''' ,'''I have a sustained distrust for all politicians, even those with whom I agree on more issues than not.''' ,'''If actual victims of discrimination had to wait on the NAACP to see them to justice, they would never get help.''' ,'''Facing fewer subscriptions, ratings drops, et al., media is catching on: people don't want endless editorializing. They want the facts, Jack. If you're going to be op/ed, at least be up front about it.''' ,'''When the media goes state and becomes nothing more than an echo chamber for the government, the task of sharing truth falls to the original keepers of liberty: the American people.''' ,'''It's easy to talk a good game in an echo chamber, it's easy to witness to people who think exactly the same way you do, but to test your convictions by going outside your comfort zone is where the ideological battle needs to go.''' ,'''Bill O'Reilly is smooth. He's one of very few broadcasters I know who can squeeze a weeks-long news cycle from one incident and make it entertaining regardless the time stamp.''' ,'''Though I work in broadcasting and host a daily radio show, I got my start in print journalism.''' ,'''The tea party movement has challenged the GOP to get back on track or risk losing its grip on the right wing. It's reminded Democrats that a slick marketing campaign coupled with paid activism isn't the same as a groundswell of real change, and the reason that Democrats are so hostile towards it is because they've never before encountered it.''' ,'''I view it as a threat to my and my family's well-being whenever anyone seeks to erode or take away my Second Amendment civil liberty.''' ,'''The tea party movement sprung from plain old disenchantment, disappointment, and outright anger at being fleeced by a government who mistook their primary job as being 'spend cash mon-nay' rather than execute the Constitution.''' ,'''Steve Bannon puts himself above everything.''' ,'''I wanted my kids to be able to look at their mom and be like, 'She can take care of herself.'''' ,'''As a young woman, I can say that sexist behavior so often perpetrated by the Left is a major reason why I and many other women left the Democratic party.''' ,'''Rallies, marches on Washington, protests, et al. are pointless if there is no action to make them mean something.''' ,'''Liberal radio performs poorly because its format already dominates other markets. And it will continue to perform poorly until the day comes when the rest of the media is at least balanced, if not fair.''' ,'''We must heed the call of action and, with courageous steps and humble hearts, work against tyranny.''' ,'''Conservatives don't need to look for 'hope' in a person because people are imperfect. Conservatives put their stock in the ideology ushered forth by our Founding Fathers, the ideals that keep us free men.''' ,'''I no longer believe that every leftist simply has a different means of achieving a successful route for America as I did formerly.''' ,'''Conserving the individual is the basis of conservatism. It is classical, de Tocqueville liberalism.''' ,'''I think Ted Cruz does a really good job; he's a rabble-rouser and thinks outside of the box.''' ,'''Crying white mothers are ratings gold.''' ,'''There is nothing more amusing than when two people known for being non-objective argue over objectivity. This is the summation of Keith Olbermann vs. Ted Koppell.''' ,'''We can avoid liberal candidates by filtering them out at the local level, nipping their ascension to power in the proverbial bud by assuring they don't get nominated in the first place - and we can't do that until we infiltrate the party, beginning at the most basic levels.''' ,'''The biggest danger to media, and what ultimately drove it apart from the public's trust, are the people who believe that they are uncorrupted when their body of work doesn't support such a belief.''' ,'''Conservatives always knew that the Left made a concerted effort to dominate in the entertainment field because it's such a fabulous way to plant the seed of an agenda. Sugar helps the medicine go down, as does seeing it on the silver screen or hearing it in a catchy pop hook.''' ,'''The media doesn't understand conservatives at all.''' ,'''We're going to fisk the 'New York Times.'''' ,'''I've had friends who have experienced pretty horrible things, some pretty brutal things, and survived. And I know that they and I would never want them to be without the ability to defend themselves.''' ,'''Meryl Streep is at the apex of Hollywood, and it is ludicrous for anyone to think or for her to expect anyone to think that she was completely ignorant of Harvey Weinstein's serial predation of women.''' ,'''Evil is evil, and it doesn't discriminate by dress. Some evil people in the headlines wear designer suits and wing-tipped shoes.''' ,'''There is no freedom in peaceful slavery.''' ,'''We either believe in accountability or we don't.''' ,'''We are a richly blessed nation; let's not squander that - one of the worst things we can do is not gratefully acknowledge our abundances.''' ,'''I couldn't reconcile being a progressive feminist with being the mother of a male: advocating for policies that discriminated against him and targeted him simply for his sex, advocating an ideology that was a direct contradiction to my role as a mother to protect and nurture my child.''' ,]
