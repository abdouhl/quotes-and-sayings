quotes = ['''I've learned one general thing in filmmaking: to work with one strong idea. One strong concept that pushes you to work in a certain way artistically.''' ,'''When you do movies on low budgets, you don't want to have a location that requires a very big light right outside the window when you're 10 stories up.

I'm attached by invisible strings.''' ,'''Believe me, I don't like being photographed. I don't like myself in pictures. Actually, I do sometimes.''' ,]
