quotes = ['''You know, I don't really judge any other sites. We really focus on our own.''' ,'''We allow the top developers whose games are being played millions of times to translate that into U.S. dollars.''' ,'''With VR, we have this same vision, which is create this ultimate platform for sharing your imagination. Our huge community of 300,000 developers creates awesome content that's immersive, that's social. Although now, instead of accessing it in your living room with your controller, you literally can jump into this content.''' ,'''As a game developer, getting your game onto a console is probably the most difficult.''' ,'''I feel we have the opportunity of being part of a new and emerging category for human co-experience.''' ,'''Even though it is virtual, we still provide a 'sandbox-style' play environment.''' ,'''Roblox is free. The dev tools are free. Anyone can come in and play with Roblox Studio and make a game and push it to our cloud and have it be playable.''' ,'''We're excited to bring the expansive world of Roblox to Android users around the world.''' ,'''We've stayed true to our vision of creating a safe and civil place where people come together to create, learn, and have fun, and it's amazing to see what we've built together with our global creator community.''' ,'''Our developers are helping and participating in the virtual economy by making games that aren't just fun, but which monetize as well.''' ,'''More and more in today's world, the opportunity to imagine and play with friends is compromised by the passive consumption of digital media and the limitations inherent in structured computer games.''' ,'''We want to be this platform, where just like building things in the real world, players can participate in a wide range of ways.''' ,'''The candidate who knows the space and is really interested in a company rather than just applying for a job will be able to engage with everyone who's interviewing him or her with interesting questions at the right level.''' ,'''Looking ahead, we're doubling down on our commitment to building the most advanced tools and technology to take our creators and players into the metaverse of the future.''' ,'''Roblox is all about inspiring and empowering people to learn, create and explore new ideas - that goes for both the experiences on our platform as well as for our employees.''' ,'''The migration to more of a developer-powered economy is actually truer to our vision, which is a platform for user-generated content driven by our community.''' ,'''We are excited to expand globally and allow kids to share back and fourth with each other.''' ,'''To enable our vast offering of user-created play, Roblox offers a virtual construction and game-development platform where everyone has the power to make anything from avatar clothing and 3D models to virtual worlds and hardcore games.''' ,'''Roblox began with just 100 players and a handful of creators who inspired one another, unlocking this groundswell of creativity, collaboration, and imagination that continues to grow.''' ,'''Our superpower is our fierce commitment to creating a positive place to work and play. Our employees have the tools and the mandate to chase big game changing ideas.''' ,'''We started having more developers who wished they could develop on Roblox forever, but they were starting to go off to Google and get jobs. It struck us that this whole platform play, where the creators were powering the fun, we could wrap it into powering the monetization as well.''' ,'''We have this vision, that over time, social play and great content will be the core of great VR.''' ,'''We are starting to see more and more Roblox games that offer creation. An example would be Theme Park Tycoon, which lets anyone construct a theme park on any device. You get to build roller coasters and theme parks, your work is saved, and when you come back, you can keep working on your creation.''' ,'''Seeing how kids lit up when they were creating things made me think of what would be the ultimate platform for our imagination.''' ,'''But I believe that as the quality of these platforms gets better, and as products like Roblox start to look and feel more like a Pixar movie, you're going to see the span of these platforms get bigger, and ultimately I believe there will be a platform company that's as big if not bigger than the publicly traded game publishers.''' ,'''We like to think that every month, that Roblox game page is showing off some of the most innovative, intelligent, and creative programmers, artists, producers, and developers around the world.''' ,'''What we primarily need in Roblox games is character control, camera control and very straightforward tool, device and weapon use.''' ,'''Roblox's strength has always been both capitalizing on the early phase but playing the long-game as well.''' ,'''Roblox is less a game than a 3-D social platform where you and your friends can pretend to be in different places. You can pretend to be in a fashion show or that you're trying to survive in a tornado or that you want to go work in a pizza restaurant, or that you're a bird and survive by catching insects.''' ,'''The foundation of Roblox is user-generated content: just like on YouTube there is so much to watch, on Roblox there is so much to play.''' ,'''The construction toy category is one category that has a lot of room to grow online.''' ,'''Platforms are going to get bigger and bigger. Minecraft and Microsoft are just the tip of the iceberg. You're going to see more and more action in this space. Not just from Microsoft's Project Spark and Sony's LittleBigPlanet.''' ,'''Above all else, everyone at Roblox is committed to member safety. We take every precaution possible to make sure kids are protected from inappropriate and offensive individuals as well as from indecent and distasteful content.''' ,'''Once parents see that Roblox isn't simply a video game, but a platform for creativity, building, coding, collaboration, and more, they become some of our biggest advocates.''' ,'''One great feature of Roblox is all mobile players join the same game servers as desktop players, connecting users across devices in a shared virtual world.''' ,'''We're not trying to create a triple-A type of platform. We're focusing more on a platform where it looks and feels high-quality, but you can kind of look at it and figure out how someone made it.''' ,'''I love building things like robots, toys, and all of that.''' ,'''We hear from parents all the time about how much their kids learn from playing and creating on Roblox.''' ,'''Kids want to build things, and we encourage them to be as imaginative as possible on the site.''' ,'''It's natural to assume Roblox will be on more and more platforms.''' ,'''Running on the cloud gives us scale. It also allows us to moderate, watch the chat, keep Roblox family-friendly and safe, and it allows just everyone to kind of push their creations and immediately scale infinitely.''' ,'''We really focus on being a platform for immersive 3D avatar experiences. Experiences that are heavily social.''' ,'''The knowledge that all the games are created by the community, it gives the opportunity to try exploratory gaming concepts. Our developers take larger risks in what they make.''' ,'''The scale is the most important part of Roblox. We'll be the biggest VR community in the world.''' ,'''We're passing milestones all the time on the amount of money our community developers are making. And we're seeing developers that are making $250,000 a year.''' ,'''There's a building kit for simple games. But more advanced users can program complex things with our script capabilities, which is built on Lua - the same language used in World of Warcraft.''' ,'''We're taking the top iconic characters and bringing them to life as toys that our players can buy. We know that our players would like to play in both dimensions.''' ,'''Loom.ai will accelerate making human co-experiences more immersive and personal, adding world-class facial animation technology as part of Roblox's efforts to provide expressive emotive actions to avatars that will enable deeper connections for our community.''' ,'''We conduct a safety review of all images, audio, and video files through a combination of human review and machine detection prior to them becoming available on our platform.''' ,'''Empowering the creativity of our developers is at the core of everything we do at Roblox.''' ,'''We're really building, at the highest level, the future of entertainment. And we're involved in the convergence of social communication and storytelling and we're doing it in immersive, 3D, social environment.''' ,'''The vision is to create the ultimate place you can imagine and then gather there with your friends. Roblox is all about these 3D places and our variety is much greater than Minecraft.''' ,'''We've had a relationship with Microsoft for a while. It's bigger than just Xbox - we use Azure for some of our cloud stuff. PC Windows is a very big platform for us as well.''' ,'''Making a game is a really complicated thing.''' ,'''We have an enormous vision for a new category for human interaction and, ultimately, immersive entertainment.''' ,'''We believe Roblox, as well as many other social games, can be experienced across platforms with great native controls.''' ,'''The whole idea of how people will learn computer science, I believe will be through game development.''' ,'''Bringing Roblox to Xbox is a huge leap forward in our mission to unite and inspire the creators, dreamers and explorers of the next generation.''' ,'''Roblox is spearheading the next generation of gaming - one in which players become developers and user-generated content is at the core.''' ,'''Roblox is not only free to play, but free to build.''' ,'''Some of our developers are starting to make $20,000 a month, which is really significant... We're getting developers who are 14 and 20 years of age making more money than their parents, starting to make a professional career of developing games on Roblox.''' ,'''We want all users to be safe on Roblox, and we will continue to invest in the safety of the game so it is a positive, productive, fun, and protected space for our community.''' ,'''Roblox is all about having great user-created content. It really ups the bar in the quality of the game.''' ,'''When Oculus adds hand controllers that will make tools, swords, and guns work better in virtual reality, you'll be able to reach out and use your virtual sword. It will make things even more interactive.''' ,'''We want kids to have an opportunity for free play. Roblox allows them to get together, make their own rules, go together wherever they might want.''' ,'''Figuring out how to keep our site safe and accessible for young people, and at the same time make it interesting, challenging, and age appropriate for older people is something that we're working heavily on.''' ,'''The more we can make our developers famous, the better.''' ,'''As the quality of our platform gets better, the developers can make more interesting experiences. As the experiences get more interesting, people enjoy them more and spend more money. As they enjoy it more, they tell their friends about it.''' ,'''Our Windows 10 experience is super polished, and it integrates all the community features seamlessly with the game experience.''' ,'''We're making it possible to publish a multiplayer, physically-simulated destructible-environment game that works on multiple devices and screen types, and can scale to 12,000 concurrent players.''' ,'''I think all of the great developers start not with the intent to make money, but with the intent to make something fun that's in their passion zone.''' ,'''Roblox gives builders the tools and freedom to put their imaginations into action.''' ,'''Being in the cloud made it easy for great content to run multiple instances. When someone makes a great experience, 30,000 people can play with it at the same time.''' ,'''There is a fair amount of moderation on the site, not only for legal reasons, but for moral ones as well. We look out for bullying and just overall safety for the kids. It is a well-groomed site.''' ,'''Using Roblox is free but the creators are able to charge virtual currency for the experiences. In our bird simulator you can become an eagle for $10.''' ,'''We're trying to create the future of entertainment through social immersive experiences where everyone can play with their friends.''' ,'''We started Roblox over a decade ago with a vision to bring people from all over the world together through play.''' ,'''Safety is not a retrofit; it's been in our DNA since day one.''' ,'''Roblox is really heavily based on automated sorting of content in various ways - what's popular with monetizing, what's been most favorited, what's most retaining.''' ,'''When you're playing tag in Roblox; or when you're working in a pizza restaurant; or when you're flying as a bird - you're there to have fun and be with your friends and to create things together.''' ,'''I am a huge fan of 'Ready Player One,' and Ernest Cline's book paints the most accurate and vivid portrayal of the metaverse we've built here at Roblox.''' ,'''People get really attached to it: many of our players have played for four to five years, and our developers range in age from eight to 80. Some of the top developers are 18 or 20, and we have kids in high-school who are making two, three or four thousand dollars a month.''' ,'''We believe as people share experiences virtually, their avatars should have the ability to express a full range of emotions.''' ,'''Roblox already works well on a phone, when we do ship on Gear and Cardboard gamers on those platforms will be able to join and play along as well.''' ,'''I founded an educational software company called Knowledge Revolution. We had the first fully animated physics lab on the computer. You could take ropes, pulleys, balls and anything else you'd use in your physics textbook and the program would allow you to build anything you can think of in a physics lab.''' ,'''We believe ultimately that human co-experience - doing things together as a social platform for play - is a new category. It's differentiated from toys or games or social networking in that it's people doing things together in real time.''' ,'''As our platform gets technically better, coupled with allowing developers to make real money on Roblox, that's created a virtuous cycle where the quality of Roblox games is continuing to go up and up.''' ,'''We think of ourselves as the best digital 'toy' around, and we are excited about the creativity, energy, and passion for success the Roblox platform continues to inspire in our builders.''' ,'''When you come to Roblox, the player participates in things that are created by the community. You can hang out in a restaurant and try to survive a tornado. All of this is created by our creative community.''' ,'''Ultimately we have the vision of expanding to a world wide platform that allows kids from the U.S. to go on field trips to China and adults around the world to make friends from different walks of life and people who have different life experiences.''' ,'''We have a vision of creating an imagination platform - the ultimate platform for play. A place for kids around the world to play, create, build and imagine together.''' ,'''The primary focus on us is making Roblox into an international, global platform that allows people to come together and do things together from all walks of life.''' ,'''You know, we're a private business so we can make our own philosophy and in the end we are business and we're all about creating a quality family brand that both our builders and gamers and players are happy with but their parents are also happy with.''' ,'''I believe companies like ours are going to be as large as media companies and social networking companies that are valued in the tens of billions of dollars.''' ,'''As a platform, our real goal is for someone who's a Roblox creator to make one experience that can work around the world in many languages.''' ,'''Roblox provides a world where kids can get together and socialize in hundreds of different settings.''' ,'''We have people building models in Roblox for their Mayan ruins history project, or we've had people build tornadoes for their weather project. Roblox can be used in a lot of different ways.''' ,'''VR provides the most immersive way of playing with Roblox, but we think it is very important that VR players can play with players on other devices.''' ,'''We continually compare Roblox to traditional gaming companies. The difference between us and them is that Roblox has millions of people always creating stuff. That gives us the viral juice both with the content and the sharing between all those users.''' ,'''We're the toolmakers. Our developers are the real creative geniuses.''' ,]
