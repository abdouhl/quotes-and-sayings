- If you get to the point in your career where you're running with a gun - I've yet to run with a gun. I've stood still with a gun, and I've walked with a gun, but I've never run with a gun. Running with a gun, to me, that's when you know you've really made it.
- I think I've cornered the market at playing ineffectual. I think I'm quite accomplished at it.
- I feel like I've gotten so lucky and gotten to do such cool things with such cool folks. It's really great. You definitely want that momentum to keep going, for sure.
- For sure, I'm an acquired taste. People who've had that acquisition, who've acquired it, are quite surprised when they see me.
- With great writing, there is great clarity.
- My biggest thing is that I would love in some form or fashion to return to the 'Marvel' universe, whether in television or a feature. I love the people at 'Marvel' and grew up reading the characters, and it was a real dream come true getting to play with the toys.
- Friends of mine were the creators and executive producers of 'Damages,' people I knew from graduate school.
- 'Suits' fans. I've never met a more diverse audience: across gender, race, class. It's incredible. People who are high-powered lawyers to doormen. A Chinese immigrant cable installer - who barely spoke English - loves 'Suits!'

- Certainly when 'Breaking Bad' had hit its tipping point, people got very excited. They couldn't believe their eyes, that Gale could be on the subway, alive and well.
- I was a total, insane 'Breaking Bad' fan.
- In addition to being an extraordinary actor, Bryan Cranston is a really generous guy and also very funny.
- Sometimes, you pinch yourself. I get to do such incredibly fun things with people who are of such an incredible caliber. It's really, really awesome.
- I moved to New York in '92 and got my graduate degree in acting from NYU - they have a great acting program. I graduated in '95.
- Every actor I know pretty much wants to be a rock n' roll star, and we'd all give it up to be in a rock n' roll band, but we're never going to do that. But being in cartoons - that's as close as you get without being an action figure.
- Because I look like Everyman on some level, I would say I get recognized once or twice a day.
