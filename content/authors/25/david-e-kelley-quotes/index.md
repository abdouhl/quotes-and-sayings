- For me, I'm happy to succeed on any network.
- I don't think it's that strange that a show has sort of a bumpy beginning. It's just part and parcel of the process.
- It gets harder and harder to succeed and find audiences with the 500-channel universe, the remote control, and people being so trigger happy with that remote control. It just gets harder to get a foothold.
- When the stories come easily and the writing process doesn't feel laboring, that's usually a good sign for me.
- The way I personally work is I like to write what I know, what I feel, and also where I am.
- I've never really told jokes. I'm not good at it.
- When you create a show, and create characters, these people are like children to you.
- Some of my high school teachers did remind me that I had an excellent imagination when it came to making up excuses.
- People are out of their home on a Saturday night or they're at the movies or they're at dinner and a lot of the people who flip on the television are doing just that. They may have never seen your show before and you can't count on to your audience to be there week in and week out.

It's a question that defense attorneys answer for themselves by not addressing.
- If you interview people or friends who work with me, they would say I'm private or internal or don't emote a lot. Yet I do it every day for 10 million people. I just don't do it for the 30 people I'm in the room with.
- You've got to honor your relationship with your audience - that they sit down because they want to be entertained. And that doesn't mean you can't provoke them and antagonize them and challenge them in the course of the entertainment as long as you keep the entertainment part of the equation alive.
- My court skills may have atrophied.
- I think the law changes, which is a nice luxury.
- I gravitate toward the law, I think, certainly more times than not, because it's our best mechanism for legislating human behavior, and morality, and ethics.
- But Steven Bochco was smart; he knew that viewers were smart.
- Chemistry is not anything an executive producer or writer can orchestrate or plan; you just hope for it.
- I don't think I could write a straight drama.
- So I think a writer should write what he loves, the people he relates to.
- I miss Denny Crane.
- When I really have to push and grope and scratch and claw to make a story work, that's a telltale sign that maybe something conceptually isn't right.
- The more lawyers there are, the more people are out there to encourage others not to go to law school.
