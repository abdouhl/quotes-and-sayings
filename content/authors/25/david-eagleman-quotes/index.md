Each one of these cells is as complicated as a city.''' ,'''Every week I get letters from people worldwide who feel that the possibilian point of view represents their understanding better than either religion or neo-atheism.''' ,'''People wouldn't even go into science unless there was something much bigger to be discovered, something that is transcendent.''' ,'''I think the first decade of this century is going to be remembered as a time of extremism.''' ,'''There are always wonderful mysteries to confront.''' ,'''There are an infinite number of boring things to do in science.''' ,'''Part of the scientific temperament is this tolerance for holding multiple hypotheses in mind at the same time.''' ,'''I think what a life in science really teaches you is the vastness of our ignorance.''' ,'''I know one lab that studies nicotine receptors and all the scientists are smokers, and another lab that studies impulse control and they're all overweight.''' ,'''We don't really understand most of what's happening in the cosmos.

What I am doing is pulling the gene forward and imaging and doing behavioural tests to understand what that difference is and how reality can be constructed so differently.''' ,'''My dream is to reform the legal system over the next 20 years.''' ,'''What we find is that our brains have colossal things happening in them all the time.''' ,'''What has always surprised me when I walk into a bookstore is the number of books that you can find that are written with certainty. The authors tell some story as though it's true, but they don't have any evidence that it is true!''' ,'''A typical neuron makes about ten thousand connections to neighboring neurons. Given the billions of neurons, this means there are as many connections in a single cubic centimeter of brain tissue as there are stars in the Milky Way galaxy.''' ,]
