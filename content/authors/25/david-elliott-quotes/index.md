- We want people to experience art and think about it. The art reflects our time, it is about our culture.
- Once we start collecting, the more you have, the more it gets valuable and that will stop us from responding to the present and taking on new ideas what the artists are doing now.
- We are concerned with the relationship between art and life. Contemporary art is only intelligible in terms of its relationship to our life.
- Unless you are a born connoisseur of art, you will not be able to judge by yourself why certain art is superior to other art.
- The educator and the public need to have an opportunity to discuss why certain art is important.
- We may not like our times or many aspects of the time we live in but that is not the fault of art as such.
