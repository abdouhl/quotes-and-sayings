quotes = ['''If you look at the play very closely, this is a thirdhand report of what a wonderful hero Macbeth is for saving Scotland. And in the next scene, he's planning to murder Duncan, and you never really know why or what's behind Macbeth.''' ,'''Opinions are 10 a penny. In the spin-driven, PR-controlled world of the 21st century, hard facts are rare indeed.''' ,'''Romney Marsh remains one of the last great wildernesses of south-east England. Flat as a desert, and at times just as daunting, it is an odd, occasionally eerie wetland straddling the coastal borders of Kent and Sussex, rich in birds, local folklore and solitary medieval churches.''' ,'''The list of Scarborough's rock credentials could go on forever.''' ,'''Scarborough never really began to live until the summer of 1964 when the Beatles played the Futurist Theatre, and no one in the audience, least of all me, heard anything but the screaming.''' ,'''Historically, Macbeth is one of the greatest kings Scotland ever had. He was on the throne for 19 years, and he simply has this dreadful reputation because Shakespeare manipulated history for the benefit of James I, who was paying him to write the play to blacken Macbeth's name.''' ,'''Nobody strikes a medal for the Royal Military Canal campaign any more, but a pint in the back bar of the ancient Mermaid Inn, perched in front of one of the biggest and oldest inglenooks you're ever likely to see, is its own reward.''' ,'''Lympne Castle opens its doors to visitors during the summer only. It is privately owned, and more an interesting medieval manor than a castle.''' ,'''Edam and Gouda are genuine Dutch cheeses, but the real thing is a lot less bland than the varieties most of us experience in the U.K.''' ,'''If you think about what 'The Killing' is, it is the theatrical production, not the script.''' ,'''Alfriston is a compact village set around a rather traffic-weary High Street, mainly of old, timbered buildings. The principal sights lie to the east on the river side.''' ,'''Flash photography can be horrible. In the hands of an expert who knows how to bounce all that searing bright light in the right direction, it may make an impossible picture workable.''' ,'''Flash turns up the optical volume so that whatever lies behind the lens - be it film or a digital sensor - is a little more receptive.''' ,'''The hearing test, which involved sitting in a quiet room listening to noises of various pitch played through headphones, confirmed the worst. I had no hearing in my left ear whatsoever.''' ,'''The path from Hythe leads, for a little while, along the line of the Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch railway, whose 15in-gauge steam trains run throughout the year from Hythe to Dungeness.''' ,'''The truth about the Costa del Sol is that what endures, what is worthwhile, is what is Spanish.''' ,'''Old Filey lies around the Ravine, a glacial gash running down to Coble Landing. This is the fishing Filey of centuries past, with neat little terraced cottages and a cluster of attractive 18th century houses.''' ,'''There are any number of reasons for visiting Filey. The beach is clean, long, and rarely crowded. The countryside is bold and handsome, with one maritime feature that deserves to be better known: the long, thin rock finger of the Brigg, pointing into the chilly grey waters of the North Sea.''' ,'''In London, the home of the quick deal is that outer ring of the seven circles of hell, Tottenham Court Road, where, as a rule, finding something with an advertised price is as likely as spotting a mermaid under Vauxhall Bridge.''' ,'''In the world of crime novels, the annual Audible Sounds of Crime awards are a pretty big deal, and I was thrilled to be shortlisted for my fifth novel in my bestselling Nic Costa series.''' ,'''Once you get over the culture shock, Filey is a pleasant spot, particularly at the beginning or end of the summer, when the hotels are half full. The brave go in winter, when the wind can be bitter and biting and Filey resumes its real life as a tiny, introverted fishing community.''' ,'''Low light demanded 'fast' film, usually ISO 400 or higher; the fastest available would be about ISO 1000. When the sun was bright, you would reach for ISO 64 to avoid the burned-out look of overexposure.''' ,'''In a sense, there is no such thing as a bargain in computing. Models which are popular sell for the price they are supposed to fetch for the best part of their product cycle.''' ,'''Surprisingly few outsiders know about the Cuckmere Valley, and it is not uncommon for people to confuse Alfriston with Alfreton in the Derbyshire Peak District.''' ,'''Few areas which are not publicly owned can boast as many footpaths as the Cuckmere Valley. For a short walk, a footbridge across the river leads back to the little hamlet of Milton Street, where another classic local pub, the Sussex Ox, provides an admirable lunch.''' ,'''I don't think I'd seen anything like 'The Killing.'''' ,'''Scripts are very different to books. They are blueprints for building, not the building.''' ,'''The problem is not that the PC you need always costs more than you can afford. The problem is that whatever the price, it is still too much.''' ,'''I want to do more audio originals because I think that it is a fascinating medium. If you think about it, this is original storytelling.''' ,'''I just love doing different things, which is what being a working author is like.''' ,'''Stand outside De Eland, on the Berenstraat Bridge over the Prinsengracht, and you see what real Amsterdam life is like.''' ,'''The bronze dwarfs give you the first clue that Wroclaw is no ordinary city. They lurk all over the place, carousing outside pubs, snoring at the doors of hotels, peeking out from behind the bars of the old city jail.''' ,'''Authors do this for a living, and if you take their work for nothing, you are depriving them of a living.''' ,'''I'm much more likely to get lynched over 'The Killing' than 'Macbeth.'''' ,'''Most visitors to Amsterdam will wander into the red-light district out of sheer curiosity. The narrow streets are mostly safe day and night - just don't try to take pictures of the women working in the windows.''' ,'''Although I'm deaf in only my left ear, when there is noise all around, I'm unable to distinguish sounds and can't hear anything.''' ,'''TV has a three storyline structure, but 'The Killing' takes on that structure with such ambition.''' ,'''Why do we use flash at all? Because photography is not the same as eyesight. We can see in low-light situations where cameras, dependent upon a physical process to record visual information, are half blind.''' ,'''Historic Amsterdam, that old part you first see when you turn up at Centraal Station, may have its monuments, but it's also the most tawdry and overcrowded part of the city.''' ,'''In Filey, you eat early to prepare for the highlight of the evening: social intercourse of a kind one thought relegated to Stanley Holloway monologues.''' ,'''Viral infections, such as mumps, rubella and meningitis, cause inflammation of the inner ear or auditory nerve, resulting in permanent damage.''' ,'''The English Channel is such a narrow little puddle, you cannot help wondering why no invader has succeeded in crossing it since 1066.''' ,'''I think there is this huge hole in Shakespeare that you do not know why Macbeth is who he is.''' ,'''Torremolinos has no Jesus Gil, no pretty little old town, and no resident celebrities to sing its praises.''' ,]
