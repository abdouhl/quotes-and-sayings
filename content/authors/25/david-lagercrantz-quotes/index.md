- Of course I want to be a best seller because I'm in the business and I want to be read, but there is no money in the world that can compensate for writing badly.
- The beautiful thing is I have sort of grown up. I don't care if I'm highbrow or not anymore.
- I'm ashamed to say that I'm from a very privileged background.
- I want to have new challenges and write new crazy books because I think it makes me a better writer to be insecure and try new things.
- The capacity of computers is doubling every eight months. It's exponential development. I think it's a real threat, actually, that a computer one day will be more intelligent than us.
- You have to search for the best writer - I'm not saying I'm the one, but it's a bad idea to just find the person who is a copycat of Stieg Larsson.
- There is no money in the world that would compensate me for writing a lousy book.
- I'm an author who likes assignments, who needs suggestions, ideas I would never have thought of otherwise - then something happens inside my alien head. Other people have to decide whether or not I'm a good writer, but I do have the ability to write in different styles.
- I have the deepest respect for Eva Gabrielsson and all she has gone through, but I also know that I make maybe her sad, and I am sad about that, but I make so many other people happy.
- All I wanted to do was to follow my passion and tell a good story.
- I know I don't want to be Stieg Larsson my whole life.
- If you have an extreme character, you need normal characters to contrast them. Sherlock Holmes certainly needed a Dr. Watson. And Pippi Longstocking, who supposedly inspired Lisbeth Salander, needed Tommy and Annika, the normal middle-class neighbors.
- I'm not a secretive guy. I'm talkative.
- Part of the brilliance of Stieg Larsson's books is that they are so complex, so many different facets coming together.
- I've always been interested in people who think out of their time, and I have this passion, actually, for science. I'm just so enormously interested in how, when you think of these revolutionary ideas, other people get threatened, especially if you are different.
- A conventional crime story is simple - it's just a corpse in the river or something, and a detective with an alcohol problem.
- I'm a strange kind of author - I like assignments. I wasn't clever enough to invent an iconic figure like Salander, but she's my kind of girl.
- We must fight intolerance, racism and the far-Right.
- I'm always interested in talented or odd people, and my whole life I've written about geniuses who society has treated badly and they strike back - or not.
- I'm very bad at violence in real life. I can't stand it. And I'm so fed up with crime novels that have too much violence. I can't really do it. It's unnecessary.
- The real demon in my life is my father.
- I was so obsessed by Lisbeth Salander and all the characters, but of course if you're going to write a crime novel worthy of Stieg Larsson, you need a plot, don't you?
- My life as an author has always been about brilliant, odd people.
- I write best when I sort of collide myself with another man. So I think, I hope, that a combination of me and Stieg Larsson will create something good.
- I have this reporter's temperament still in me - I thrive under pressure.
- My father was highbrow: writing long biographies of Dante and stuff like that. Ghostwriting sportsman memoirs? That was sort of the lowest of the low.
- We had all these famous writers in Sweden and from all over the world home at dinner. I wanted to be a writer, and I wanted to be a highbrow writer as my father. He never, ever read anything like crime novels. He wrote biographies of Dante, James Joyce, August Strindberg and Joseph Conrad.
- All great characters, great icons, in literature are a bit of a riddle, and that's the reason we go back to them over and over.
- I wrote about Alan Turing, the great mathematician and code-breaker. He was an absolutely different person, certainly more brilliant than I ever will be.
- A supervillain must continue to exist.
- I want to be read, and I certainly want to sell, but I also see my father's eye from Heaven: 'Always write quality. It doesn't matter if you sell; if it's good, it's good - if you capture the complexity of life.'
- My father was this huge, influential intellectual in the '60s and '70s. He was one of the main players in the cultural discussion in Sweden, the editor of papers.
- Alan Turing is such an amazing, tragic story.
- I met a lot of hackers, and some of them were very arrogant. They thought I was stupid because I couldn't follow what they were talking about. But then I met this great guy whom companies hire to find their security holes, and he was very good about explaining so I could understand.
- I said from the start I had to be trustful of the Millennium universe. It was not going to be a Stieg Larsson book, but my interpretation of his iconic characters and universe.
