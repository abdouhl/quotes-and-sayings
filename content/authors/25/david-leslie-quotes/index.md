quotes = ['''The team's aims are do to the best we can basically.''' ,'''The one I was driving for at the time, Nissan, they pulled out after they won the championship, because it was costing millions of pounds to do a national championship and ok, that might be ok when you're doing an international championship, but not for a national one.''' ,'''It is expensive to start from scratch though.''' ,'''We've had to set a workshop up; we've had to equip the workshop and everything else. But all that equipment is there now and whatever projects they want to use it for in the future.''' ,'''Some other people are very lucky and always get in to the very best teams at the very best times and therefore go out and score lots of championship points and be in with a chance of the championship.''' ,'''The team is very enthusiastic - everyone is trying hard to do their best, and everyone is putting a lot of effort in to moving forward and getting the right results and it's a very good, close-knit team.''' ,'''It will be hard work. It's always hard work, and hard work from everybody within the team - technical director, mechanics, drivers, engineers - everyone in the team.''' ,'''I'd like to see us improving on what we had last year.''' ,'''I don't think it's so much of a disadvantage setting up from scratch.''' ,'''Unfortunately we don't have all the bits and pieces on the car that we had hoped to have by this stage so we've got to make as good a job as we can with what we have and we feel we are doing well with that at the moment.''' ,'''It's a good team though that works very closely and very well together, and all those people putting that effort in, then I'm sure we will improve dramatically from where we are now as the season goes on.''' ,'''I would like to become champion, but I'm realistic about it.''' ,'''From where started, I think it is too far down to try and win a championship at the end of the season, although we had a very good first race at Mondello and scored some good points.''' ,]
