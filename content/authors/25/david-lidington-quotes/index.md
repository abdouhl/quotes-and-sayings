All of us who are adults remember how daunting it was, but we sometimes take it for granted that children will be able to cope with the change.''' ,'''Sometimes getting something off your chest to someone else is an important step in coping - so you know that you're not alone, you're not failing, and that it is perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed or sad at times.
