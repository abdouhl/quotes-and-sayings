It is treating the nation as if it was the property of a single individual, and he had the right to bequeath it to whom he pleased - the same as a patch of land for which he had the patent.''' ,'''I have always supported measures and principles and not men.''' ,'''The enemy fought with savage fury, and met death with all its horrors, without shrinking or complaining: not one asked to be spared, but fought as long as they could stand or sit.''' ,'''Look at my arms, you will find no party hand-cuff on them.''' ,'''We must not permit our respect for the dead or our sympathy for the living to lead us into an act of injustice to the balance of the living.''' ,'''You may all go to Hell, and I will go to Texas.''' ,'''Let your tongue speak what your heart thinks.''' ,'''The party in power, like Jonah's gourd, grew up quickly, and will quickly fall.''' ,'''Throughout the day no time for memorandums now.

This rule will hit nine times out of ten.''' ,'''It was expected of me that I was to bow to the name of Andrew Jackson... even at the expense of my conscience and judgement. such a thing was new to me, and a total stranger to my principles.''' ,'''You will find me standing up to my rack, as the people's faithful representative, and the public's most obedient, very humble servant.''' ,'''It is a huckleberry above my persimmon to cipher out how it is, with six months' schooling only, I, David Crockett, find myself the most popular bookmaker of the day, and such is the demand for my works that I cannot write them half fast enough, no how I can fix it.''' ,'''If one man in the country could take all the money, what was the use of passing any bills about it?''' ,'''I learned to read a little in my primer, to write my own name, and to cypher some in the three first rules in figures. And this was all the schooling I ever had in my life, up to this day. I should have continued longer if it hadn't been that I concluded I couldn't do any longer without a wife, and so I cut out to hunt me one.''' ,'''I voted against this Indian bill, and my conscience yet tells me that I gave a good, honest vote, and one that I believe will not make me ashamed in the day of judgment.''' ,'''I would rather be politically dead than hypocritically immortalized.''' ,'''Fame is like a shaved pig with a greased tail, and it is only after it has slipped through the hands of some thousands, that some fellow, by mere chance, holds on to it!''' ,'''Be always sure you are right - then go ahead.''' ,'''No man who has not tried it can imagine what dreadful hard work it is to listen.
