quotes = ['''The joy of 'The X-files' is how it plays on so many different realities never knowing what is the truth and what is the deception. So my approach to my character has always been that we are alive and have always been alive and were never 'killed off' but held a fake funeral in 'Jump the Shark' to get the heat off of us.''' ,'''The beauty of any conspiracy theory is that because it can't be proved, that just makes it more 'real.' It's not a question of believing or not believing, really; it's more a question of just accepting a series of probabilities that lead to an undeniable conclusion.''' ,'''I believe in the potential of all things possibly imagined that can be made into a reality. My uncle was a Swedish scientist, and in the 1970s, he would speak of computers controlling most things in the future and self-driving cars and wireless communication. All the things that we are living with now.''' ,'''The 'conspiracy theorist' is no longer a crazy person with a tinfoil hat, but they are the Edward Snowdens and the WikiLeaks that bring down major institutions and are the catalysts for social change.''' ,'''I was the class clown in school, and I was also a child actor - not on television, but in the theatre.''' ,'''It would seem staggeringly arrogant to think we were the only ones in the universe, but at the same time, I don't know if contact has been made yet or not because you think something like that would be hard to cover up. I'm still on the fence. I keep an open mind about all of these things.''' ,'''And as I have always said, the only thing more scary than knowing we are not alone in the universe is knowing we are alone in the universe.''' ,]
