quotes = ['''The promise of American opportunity and prosperity means something different to each of us. What we each envision varies in terms of wants and needs, and aspirations can change over time. But we all want to see our children have more opportunities than we had.''' ,'''There is no justifiable reason why our electricity, heating and cooling and transportation needs aren't powered by 100 percent renewable energy.''' ,'''Everything depends on our ability to sustainably inhabit this earth, and true sustainability will require us all to change our way of thinking on how we take from the earth and how we give back.''' ,'''In spite of our agonizing history, Native American people find much to celebrate. The songs, the dances, the culture and traditions surrounding planting and harvests, the prayers that are sent upward for healing and peace, and the welcoming of children into our families, are all reasons for us to keep moving forward with optimism.''' ,'''During my elementary and middle school years, my mother made me and my siblings' lunches every single day - this was affordable for a Marine climbing the ranks and supporting a family of six.''' ,'''Immigrants and Native Americans have made our country what it is today, and if we've learned anything through these hundreds of years - it should be that we can accomplish more when we work together.''' ,'''If anyone can say 'go back,' it's Native Americans. My Pueblo ancestors, despite being targeted at every juncture - despite facing famine and drought - still inhabit this country today. But indigenous people aren't asking anyone to go back to where they came from.''' ,'''I know what it's like to have to put back food at the checkout line because you don't have enough money and those kinds of things.''' ,'''On this 50th Earth Day, we face a crisis unknown to those who gathered on the first Earth Day - the climate crisis.''' ,'''It's taken over 240 years for there to be a Native American woman elected to congress, so it's definitely significant that we were able to accomplish that.''' ,'''Racism and bigotry should never fuel any administration's policies. Calls to send anyone 'back' contradict who we should be as a country and the ideals for which we stand.''' ,'''We're a matrilineal society, as Pueblo women, and there are a lot of tribes across the country who are.''' ,'''Like many New Mexicans, I enjoy spending time outdoors and understand how important New Mexico's natural beauty and resources are.''' ,'''For almost 20 years, I've worked on various campaigns. I started out as a phone volunteer. I'd go into campaign offices, ask for lists of Native American voters, and just start calling people because I felt that I just wanted to help more Native folks get to the polls.''' ,'''There is no moral high ground from which President Trump or any of his followers can tell anyone to leave this country, because they are not the first inhabitants of this land. They should instead look into their history to learn where, when and why their ancestors came to this country.''' ,'''We need more people in office who understand struggle. In Congress, I want to take my experience and fight to expand support for families who are hurting.''' ,'''We must ensure full access to all reproductive health services, including abortion. We must also provide for our aging population, ensuring our parents and grandparents have the care they need. We must defend Medicare, expand Social Security, and provide tax credits for families who care for their elders and loved ones with disabilities.''' ,'''As someone who has dealt with economic hardship, I am committed to making the changes necessary for our country to become more equitable. And to do so, I believe we need to think big.''' ,'''We are not strangers to poverty in New Mexico.''' ,'''In 2008, I was a full-time volunteer for Barack Obama's first election. I'd take a carload of people and we'd go and canvass in a Native American community every evening.''' ,'''I have spent my life fighting for the underrepresented and I am working tirelessly to be New Mexico's champion in Congress.''' ,'''We must be welcoming to those who flee their country because of violence and abject poverty in hopes of a better future - that's who we are as Americans.''' ,'''Elizabeth Warren has been a champion for working people. She has been a champion for Native people. She has been a champion for education and all of the things that we should care about in this country.''' ,'''If we're not protecting our women and we're not protecting our girls and we're not protecting the most vulnerable people in this society, who are we as a country?''' ,'''The GOP wants to cut funding for birth control, place undue burdens on clinics that serve low income women and families, and defund Planned Parenthood.''' ,'''Loss of natural areas threatens our water supply, national security, farms, and health.''' ,'''We have a government-to-government relationship with tribes, and they should have that opportunity to weigh in on important decisions that affect them.''' ,'''Over-dependence on finite resources, like oil, ignores the ability of our great minds to develop alternative energy for the masses, and in doing so ignores climate change and sets up our students and workforce for failure by not educating them about the needs of our future.''' ,'''We are pushing for Medicare-for-all. That's an economic issue - it really is. And if we can work toward a fair, more-equitable system for working families, everybody would have health care.''' ,'''Moving to 100 percent renewable energy is a good economic opportunity, one that the U.S. must seize before other nations take full advantage of it.''' ,'''When my daughter Somah was young, I didn't have much money. But I was fortunate to find a preschool where I could volunteer in exchange for lower tuition. I saw firsthand how an early childhood education shaped my daughter's success.''' ,'''If Trump wants to appeal to protectionism, the president should be protecting Americans from global warming and the accompanying extreme weather that's becoming more common.''' ,'''SNAP benefits help local economies because the benefits are spent at local grocery stores - with locally grown and locally-made products. I remember many years ago, while on food stamps, I advocated for the benefits to be spent at local farmers markets - a move that has helped local economies even more.''' ,'''We have to move toward renewable energy in a big way here in America.''' ,'''Time and again, it has been proven that SNAP benefits are the most valuable government stimulus we can have for local economies.''' ,'''I think Nancy Pelosi is extremely qualified to be speaker of the House, because she has been speaker of the House. I trust her leadership. I trust her judgment.''' ,'''We need a national universal paid family leave program that allows families to be together in the most important moments of our lives - from having a baby to caring for a dying parent.''' ,'''We must shift our thinking away from short-term gain toward long-term investment and sustainability, and always have the next generations in mind with every decision we make.''' ,'''It would be nice if every state were like New Mexico and cared about the Indian vote.''' ,'''Any type of anti-Semitism in any form needs to be soundly rejected.''' ,'''If we don't have a planet, we don't have anything.''' ,'''Running for Congress isn't something I ever thought I would do.''' ,'''I'm concerned that if we don't do more to protect our open spaces and reduce climate change, there will be devastating and lasting impacts on us and future generations.''' ,'''Too many American families go bankrupt from healthcare expenses, and low wage workers have to hold two or three jobs just to make ends meet, which leaves many young children without any hope of having a pre-K education - the most important start to a good education and a path out of poverty.''' ,'''As an organizer in the most underrepresented communities in my state, I have felt the frustration that so many voters must feel when other states limit polling locations, require photo IDs, and put unnecessary barriers in front of voters.''' ,'''I think it's important to always have diversity, in our Congress or anywhere, but you also need diversity not just for women of color who are most underrepresented, but diversity in different walks of life.''' ,'''In New Mexico, we're very lucky that we have laws in place that really help ensure that Native Americans' right to vote is unencumbered.''' ,'''Native American activists have been present as long as the Europeans have been working to colonize us.''' ,'''I am disappointed and frustrated by the FCC's decision to ignore the vast majority of Americans across the political spectrum, and instead side with corporations that now have the power to manipulate Internet access based on who can pay more.''' ,'''We don't have time to play politics with people's lives or the planet's future.''' ,'''My first job was at a local bakery, and when I graduated from high school, I was promoted from retail sales to cake decorator.''' ,'''We can't afford to compromise on anything we have fought for - abortion is legal in our country, and I will do everything in my power to stand up for the rights of women and all people to choose when and how they build a family.''' ,'''The tenets of my cultural teachings are rooted in our commitment to lift up every community member so that no one is left behind. Work and food were shared equally. Through our commitment to community, we care about children, even when they aren't ours, and we want our old folks, and yours, to live their last days in dignity and comfort.''' ,'''Trump continues to diminish the office of the Presidency.''' ,'''When the sun is sending more energy to earth in one hour than the entire world consumes in a year, any political play to undermine our ability to harness this energy effectively and efficiently is clearly not economical but it's also unethical.''' ,'''Offshore drilling is not the solution to U.S. energy independence, and I am against opening parts of the Arctic, Pacific and Atlantic oceans to oil and natural gas production.''' ,'''The provision of healthcare in America has been a major policy issue for many decades. From the establishment of Medicare & Medicaid to the Affordable Care Act, we have struggled to find a solution for not just providing access to healthcare - but also becoming a healthier population.''' ,'''I was a chairwoman of my state Democratic party.''' ,'''I learned from my parents to revere nature. Their way of teaching my siblings and I to respect the environment was to be in it, and so we spent a great deal of time outdoors.''' ,'''My dad was a 30-year career Marine. He was stationed in Quantico Va., and another military base.''' ,'''I will fight special interests in Washington who exploit Native, rural, and low income communities for the purpose of fracking and drilling that pollutes our environment. No short or long term gain is worth polluting our water. Water is life.''' ,'''The Republicans cry for smaller government; however, it seems that at every turn, they work at interfering with the lives of Americans, and we can add food-choice to the list.''' ,'''We - our children need a quality public education.''' ,'''Every American has a right to food, housing, and health care - and we can afford to provide it if billionaires and big corporations pay their fair share.''' ,'''I think it's important that we have different perspectives.

But one day, I looked in the mirror and realized I wanted more, for me and my people. I saw too many Native Americans struggling, and I realized we should have a voice in who our elected officials are.''' ,'''Healthcare is a human right. No one should face bankruptcy or death because of lack of healthcare. All Americans - regardless of their health or residential status - should be able to access the healthcare they need, whenever they need it.''' ,'''A free and open Internet is crucial for innovation and the exchange of information and ideas. It allows grassroots communities to organize and mobilize against injustice across our nation and the globe. It's good for business, consumers, and our entire economy.''' ,'''The majority of America wants action on climate change. The majority of America thinks we should regulate carbon dioxide as a pollutant. And the majority of America thinks we should prioritize solar and wind infrastructure over fossil fuels. Those are impressive majorities, ones that every office seeker and office holder should heed.''' ,'''The health of Americans must no longer be a commodity to be traded, bought, or sold for profit by the insurance and pharmaceutical industries. We must promote medical and Medicaid home models to provide comprehensive care for body, mind, and spirit.''' ,'''In 1881, my dad's grandparents, who were Norwegian farmers, immigrated to the United States - the same year my great grandfather from Laguna Pueblo was put on a train to Carlisle Indian School in Pennsylvania.''' ,'''The 50th Earth Day was always going to be special, but the coronavirus pandemic has made it even more so.

It's an attack on human rights.''' ,'''My mother was an extremely strong Pueblo woman. My grandmother was the same. I had strong women in my life. My aunties who were there for me every step of the way.''' ,'''I want every young Indigenous girl to think about getting involved in their communities.

Some Tribes were wiped out by 90 percent, while others were completely decimated.''' ,'''The Violence Against Women Act didn't have specific provisions for Indian country until 2013, which is really sad. It's Native women who are the most vulnerable.''' ,'''We have to protect our democracy.''' ,'''I wasn't raised to make history. In high school and family, no one around me was politically involved, and few of my friends planned to attend college or even thought about it.''' ,'''My mother was a stay-at-home mom until I turned 14, and up to that point, we were made to study hard after school each day, and appreciate what my dad called 'a free education.'''' ,'''We only have one earth.

We have to find solutions to make their lives better, right?''' ,'''I will continue to be at the forefront, participating in rallies, marches, letter-writing campaigns, and fighting for federal funding for Planned Parenthood. And, I will always oppose the nomination of any anti-choice U.S. Supreme Court Justice.''' ,'''It's always really great when your hard work pays off.''' ,'''The immigration policies that Donald Trump and the Republicans are pushing are downright hateful and must be stopped.''' ,]
