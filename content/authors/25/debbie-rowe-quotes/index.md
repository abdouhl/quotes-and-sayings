- I turned out two pretty good-looking kids. For that I am proud.
- Michael and I will always be connected with the kids. I will always be there for him. I will always be there for the children. And people make remarks: 'I can't believe she left her children.' Left them? I left my children? I did not leave my children. My children are with their father, where they are supposed to be.
- Michael had a very low pain tolerance, and his fear of pain was incredible. And I think that doctors took advantage of him that way.

- Didn't know I had a half sister until I was 12 or 13. So that was interesting.
- I had eyebrows and eyeliner tattooed, so I have, like, make-up. How lovely is that?
- Michael respected doctors immensely: that they went to school, that they studied... to do no harm.
- Coyotes are smart and hunt very well in L.A. When dogs are small, you can't leave them out alone - especially at daybreak, night time, and evening.
- You know what Michael did? He got me the most fabulous place to live. If you read the tabloids, it's the enclave of the enclave, Beverly Hills, which I have no idea what an enclave is. If it's chic-chic, it's cool.
- My lawyer is telling me I have to take some responsibility about the welfare of the children. Do I want the kids? Hell no. Does it look good for me to ask for them? Absolutely. I don't want to look like the woman who gave away her kids and just forgot about them.
- I was Michael's best friend.
- Michael did it all. I am telling you that he is the most brilliant father. Almost before the baby needed something, he knew what it was.

- I am possessive and protective of my babies. Their happiness means more to me than anything else on this world. I love them more than I would ever have thought was possible.
- The very rich, very poor, and the very famous get the worst medical care. The very rich can buy it, the very poor can't get any, and the very famous can dictate it.

- One of the saddest things in this world is to see a child grow up hating one of their parents because they only got one side of the story.
