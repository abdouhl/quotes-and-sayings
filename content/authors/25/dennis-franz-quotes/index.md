- Coming from Chicago, I like a white Christmas.
- I'm not one of these actors who feels a pressing need to direct, and I have no plans to do it.
- For lack of a better term, they've labeled me a sex symbol. It's flattering and it should happen to every bald, overweight guy.
- My doctor asked me if I smoked, and I said only when I'm working, golfing, or drinking. Then I realized the only time I don't smoke is when I'm home. I didn't even realize I'd become a smoker.
- I'll miss the relationships I have built with these actors. I'll miss the devotion we have to this work. Over this length of time, the tendency is to think it will never end.

- I was so emotional. Choked up. I could hardly talk all day. I'll be cleaning out my trailer and saying goodbye soon, realizing what a wonderful experience this has been.
- One of the things I had a hard time getting used to when I came to California in '78 was Santa Claus in shorts.
- In a perfect world, you would be able to hold onto everyone. But It's not realistic. The changes with NYPD have been progressive and have taken the show to new levels.
- Everyone needs to be proactive and know the various warning signs of cancer. Early detection and research to make detection easier at earlier stages, along with the treatments needs, is still a must. I salute all those winning the battle.
