- I have in the past overly trusted people and was, in turn, let down by some. Since then, I have learned the difference between putting faith into people and blindly trusting them.

- Forever 21 is my American Dream.
- It's important my daughters learn from the hard work my wife and I put into this company. Who better to look out for your best interests than family?
- When I first immigrated to the United States, there were not many jobs that stood out. So I worked at a gas station, cleaning.
- I feel truly blessed by Forever 21's success.
- When we started, the business name was 'Fashion 21.' And change it to 'Forever 21' later.
- I noticed the people who drove the nicest cars were all in the garment business.
