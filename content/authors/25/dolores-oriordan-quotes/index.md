- Sometimes your kids give you that shove out the door to do things that you need. Teenagers are good that way; they keep you in the loop.
- The writing became a hobby in the background: it took a back seat to parenthood and being a person and being a human being.
- I worked myself into a frenzy. By 1996, I had a nervous breakdown just from working. I couldn't eat, couldn't sleep, just getting anxiety attacks and all of that stuff because I was doing too much, too young, all the time.
- Each gig is brilliant and fun. When it becomes a routine, we'll take a break. There's no point in doing it if you don't enjoy it.
- For an artist or an entertainer, it's the ultimate when you can go to the forest when you're done your work and escape.
- My mom always had a softer spot for boys, as a lot of Irish women do. If you were a girl, you'd have to sing or wear a pretty dress. But boys could just sit there and be brilliant for sitting there and being boys. It makes you that little bit more forward. Pushy. I was singing, always.
- My husband Don's mother, Denise, was diagnosed with cancer, and she was given eight months to live. We decided to go and stay there and help live her days with her, 'cause you don't get those chances again, right?
- You get older and come to the conclusion that it's a great gig making music. Even if you turn into an old gnarly fart, no one cares what you look like if you write good songs - the only gig is to sing well and perform.
- I was a full-time mom for seven years. You go back on tour, you're back in hotels, you're ordering room service, and you're getting an itinerary slipped under your door every,day. You're kind of thinking, 'Did I go home for seven years, or was that just a dream?'
- I try to think about optimism. I try to look at the beautiful things in life.
- We all wonder about death, where people go and what happens. But certainly, they cross over from this dimension to another one.
- For a while there, our writing got really edgy... I've always written about experiences, so when your life gets a bit crazy, you start to write songs that are a bit edgy.
- There's always a party in my bus.
- In 1997, we took time off, and that's when Oasis broke and Princess Diana died and I was home with my baby hating the music industry. People asked what I thought about the Spice Girls, and honestly, I was so happy to tell them I couldn't be bothered to care.
- I guess the way to keep a grip on reality is just to take breaks in between albums like most normal bands do. Go home and be a person and hang out with your friends. Do separate things and get back to earth and write songs and go out there again.
- We all got older, and we'd tell our children things like, 'Mommy used to be in a famous rock band,' but they didn't believe us. Part of the reason for our reunion was to show our children what we did to make the lives they have possible.
- I was at that point where my children needed more than going around the planet in the back of a bus. They needed stability, they needed to build their own lives and relationships, and I needed to put my life on hold. I made my choice - I chose my children.
- A lot of these songs just came from day-to-day experiences. And it was a very natural, kind of organic process.
- For me, you can't be a big fat pig up there, slovenly and singing croaky and whatnot. You have to work.
- I went very close to the edge, but it's nice to have been strong enough to get through it. I'm lucky I had family, a good husband, and my mom. People like that help balance you. When you're feeling down and bad, it's the people that love you who kind of sort your head out for you.
- I lived in buses. I didn't really have anything else. I didn't feel like a female, and I ended up really kind of isolated. Everybody thinks you're so happy and so wealthy and such a big star, but you're really kind of lonely and don't know how to stop it.
- I got to a point where I referred to myself as Dolores of the Cranberries instead of myself because I alienated my real self from what I became so much.
- I've come to the conclusion that life is for the taking and just too short to dwell on the negative.
- My parents were in the local church choir, and I used to go along and sing and play the organ at all the weddings and christenings.
- I didn't know initially whether I'd like doing TV and whether I'd be able to work with other people. I've always done my own thing. I've never put myself into that situation, but it's the most fun I've had in years.
- It's very difficult to break in Europe unless you break in England, and it's very difficult to break in England if you're Irish.
- People don't look at you singing. They go within themselves and listen. Music is about listening, not looking. That's why I wore these huge baggy dresses on stage with The Cranberries.
- Luckily I don't have a sinful past, because there's nothing you can hide from your kids now.
- I'm an icon. I'm the Queen of Limerick.
- The first album didn't become successful until the second was practically written.
- I look like that in the morning: my hair's all greasy - it's not, 'Hey, look at the babe of the band!' I hate that kind of thing, the way women are always pushed forward as beauties... it's very easy: you can make the ugliest pig look lovely in a photograph.
- The things a young woman goes through between the ages of 18 and 20 are far different than what a young woman can go through between 20 and 22.
- As you get older, it's good to open up and acknowledge that everybody has their scary moments, their negative moments. And in order to move on and find comfort and hope, you have to stop running from the darkness and face it. And when you face it, it's not that scary at all, and sometimes it actually turns around and runs away.
- When The Cranberries got really big in Ireland, it became difficult for me to be there with all the photographers and paparazzi.
- You want to be in control of a lot. You grow up. You sink or swim. I suppose I swam.
- What's amazing is - I actually have problems getting it into my head - Canada is so big, right? And Ireland's small, you know; you drive from coast to coast in three hours.
- I don't appreciate people invading my privacy.
- You know that band that are all over 'Melody Maker,' Huggy Bear, they're just a load of crap, right? Riot grrrl group - y'know, it's all sexism and stuff, women standing up for their rights: 'This girl said this at the gig off the stage.' It's nothing got to do with music. They're probably untalented gits when it comes to the crunch.
- Not everybody wanted a female to be the front face of a big band, you know... You had to be three times better than a man had to be.
- I write about what is getting to me at the time, about the things you need to talk about, but which would sound silly if you sat down and told them to your friend. I only write for myself, to get my emotions out. It's self-therapeutic.
- I thought the best thing to do to bring me back to reality would be to have a child, and by the time I had my first, Taylor, when I was 25, we'd sold 35 million records as a band, and I'd had enough; I knew my sanity was more important than success.
- I hated singing, I hated being on stage; I hated being in the Cranberries. I was constantly crying. I was going insane. I wanted to be a shopkeeper, a hairdresser, anything. I was so desperate to have a reality, friends, a regular, boring life. I missed that.
- I missed a lot of family weddings and funerals because we were out on the road and had these big gigs, and you can't pull out of these gigs at the last minute because too many people are counting on it. It got to the point where I was consumed with that.
- I love to go home to my kids. I don't have that lull in my life when I didn't have them.
- It's pretty weird when you are just touring all the time and you don't have a normal life. You're out of touch with reality too much.
- We were never a frivolous band; we prided ourselves on having something to say, and I think that's what gives your songs longevity.
- When the band were really big and we had massive hits, I was always stressed-out and insecure. I thought I wanted the band to be really popular, but when that happened, there was so much pressure to keep it going.
- 'Linger' was the first song I wrote after joining the Cranberries. I was 18, and the youngest member of the band was 16 at the time. We never imagined it'd be such a big hit.
- Everyone at school knew I wanted to be a singer. I'd always be banging on the piano playing my new song. The teacher would gather us round, and the whole class would listen.
- It was different to what everyone else was doing. It was very hard to pigeonhole The Cranberries. And we were just huge; it was just sensational.
- It's a great gig, really: getting on stage, playing the guitar, singing. For a living, it's super.
- I keep my children safe and protected from all my baggage. They get to have a normal childhood, and they're not affected by my life.
- When the Greatest Hits came out and we did that tour, I just felt I wanted to take a break, totally. Probably because, as well, I was so young when I got famous. I did album, tour, album, tour, album, tour, then I had a public nervous breakdown where I just lost tons of weight.
- You can't be in a situation where you are not happy. It's as simple as that.
- When you're pregnant or living with an infant, there's a kind of sacredness around your body that affects everything you do.
- I was 19 when I wrote 'Dreams,' and that would have been when it started to happen. The band got signed, and I was probably beginning to see different things besides my small town of Ballybricken.
- It was tough. We went right from being teenagers to musical superstars with money and fame and attention. All of us had a hard time adjusting to it, especially me.
- When I was about 14, I got a tacky keyboard for 250 pounds and put on a drum machine and found I could write a song.
- Only we were in The Cranberries. Only we know what it was like being in that crazy whirlwind of fame. We have children and spouses and lives, but there is only one Cranberries.
- The feeling that's in your heart all the time comes out spiritually in your voice and the music.
- I guess all bands get to that point where they run out of inspiration and just get bored with the chemistry.
- Room service is nice. Ooh-la-la, a hotel. At home, it's laundry and school lunches.
- I think there's a difference between somebody who grows up in Paris or London and goes to Los Angeles. But if you grow up in the green fields, and you rarely go into the city, you're so overprotected that when you do go to L.A., it's almost a bigger slap in the head.
- I went to Irish dance when I was four. I was playing the tin whistle when I was five. So I think certain things are bred into you.
- When everybody's looking at you, it does your head in. When you're always on the inside, sometimes you can't see the forest for the trees.
- In Canada, anything that's not in the city is referred to as a cottage. Or a log cabin.
- Why can't we actually sing and get respected as good singers and songwriters without having our boobs and butt hanging out?
- I enjoyed living in Canada, where my husband comes from, because I was treated like any ordinary person. I became a volunteer at my children's school; I went into the classroom. It was very grounding. I got sick of being famous.
- I was so young when I got so famous, and then I kind of put up a wall around myself. I didn't really want to show people any fragilities or fears; I was trying to be this tough person that I felt was expected of me.
- There's no point in getting too worried about things, because life is too short.
- I remember when MTV first put 'Linger' in heavy rotation, every time I walked into a diner or a hotel lobby, it was like, 'Jesus, man, here I am again.'
- When my grandfather died, I was on tour, and I didn't go to the funeral. I never got to say goodbye, and this is one of the problems of being in a rock band is that you're away, and your loved ones die, and you can't even see them.
- When you're on tour too much or on stage too much, you feel like you have to deliver and get this super-hyped vibe going.
- I just block out the demons. I sing. I block them away. I put my pain into my music. I paint. I make my own videos. I direct myself. No one directs me anymore. I am in charge of my destiny.
- I didn't really know many girls, growing up, because there weren't many other people living around where I lived.
- The school I went to was so Gaelic that you learned how to play the tin whistle and how to Irish-dance in class.
- One day we were in Limerick... and then, a few weeks later, we were being flown around to play. When we started, it was just a hobby. It wasn't any big ambition.
- I am just trying to live for my kids. It is all about my kids now. I love them endlessly.
- I always come across like I'm looking serious, but I just don't like smiling. Honestly, obviously I'm different in person.
- When I got pregnant, I started singing again. It was my saving grace. I literally mean having this amazing human life, and our relationship in the sense of mother and child, redeemed my soul.
- Men have no idea how much more difficult it is for women in the rock and roll industry, and while we are trying to give birth, breastfeed, all they do is have a good time.
- U2 and Sinead O'Connor - I haven't a clue why we're compared to them. Apart from us all being Irish, we've nothing in common.
- My kids mean more to me than anything I thought was important when I was younger.
- People often ask me why I sing with a strong Irish accent. I suppose when I was five years old, I spoke with a strong Irish accent, so I sang with one, too.
- It's important to take time off because it's a long journey this life, and I want to be singing in 30 years' time. You see a lot of artists who get caught up in the here and now, and they just burn themselves out, and I kind of did that myself with my third album.
- I was so famous that I couldn't leave the hotel room. I remember looking out of the window at all these fans but just feeling so isolated.
- I didn't get a lot of attention from my dad when I was young. That's a big part of it for girls. Because your dad is the first love of your life. If he doesn't put you on his lap and give you a pet, you do end up not really liking yourself that much.
- My father, I spent a lot of time with him at the hospital. I was with him when he took his last breath, but I felt something coming from him into my hand and into my body.
- It's amazing to see anyone come out, let alone tell you they have been waiting so long. They are loyal people, our fans.
- Growing up, there was a lot of pressure for women to be good-looking, but my mum was very strict, and she didn't allow me to wear make-up. Looking back, it was good for me. It slowed me down from becoming an adult too quickly.
- It was great about the sizes of the audiences we were getting in America, but sometimes you feel like telling some of the men that you're not on stage to have your body looked at.
- People look at you and see a product. They don't see a soul. They see an empty hole.
- I'm an artist, and I need to work, like everybody. We need to be challenged and that we're getting up and doing something with our lives.
- To me, life is a bit of everything. I have the band, I have my kids. Life is a big picture. It's not just your career.
- You never find peace in this realm, but it's okay, because when my dad went to the other side, he looks after me now better than he did in life. He is with me all the time.
- I lived in a small village outside the city and grew up in a large family, so my world was very much centred around that. I used to sing in the local church, and I would also occasionally sing in the local pubs for which I used to get a few bob. That, for me, was the start of my interest in music, which has obviously expanded since then.
- I love performing, and I love the idea of people buying records. I don't particularly like the idea of people knowing me or thinking they do, but that's a part of what I choose. I choose not to go to college; I choose to be a singer.
- Once you succeed at what you're doing, your parents see that what you were doing wasn't so bad after all, though they'd prefer to see you in a secure lifestyle where you have a contract for years and years, or you have a diploma or degree.
- We have a certain bond that we don't have with anyone else on the planet. You just have that bond, that journey when you are in a band together.
- My priorities were taking the kids to school and being a mum and being a daughter and being a sister. Just spending a lot of that time with my family that I'd probably lost a lot of, touring with the Cranberries.
