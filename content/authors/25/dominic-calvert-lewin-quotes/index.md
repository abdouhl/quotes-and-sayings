quotes = ['''It's very difficult, but if I'm talking from my personal view and what I do as a job, which is playing football, how the Premier League and football handles racism should be with great severity because there's no place for it in the world.''' ,'''I like to bring different things to the table.''' ,'''I like to think I have shown I am ready to live up to the expectations of being Everton's number nine.''' ,'''To be one of only three Englishmen to have scored in a World Cup finaI is amazing.''' ,'''My leap is something that I've always had.

But no-one can really prepare you for the mental side of things and having 40,000 fans saying you're not a good player or you don't belong.''' ,'''It's what you dream of as a kid, playing for your country and winning a World Cup.''' ,'''It doesn't matter where you come from.''' ,'''We're human beings, we're still learning and still growing.''' ,'''As a footballer you're so in a routine, and you do the same things every day.''' ,'''I went to Everton, and it's levels - the higher up you get, you are under more and more scrutiny as a football player. You have to learn to deal with it at that scale and gradually progress to be able to deal with it at an even higher scale.''' ,'''I have been guilty of running here, there and everywhere and not being enough of a goal threat.

It's definitely toughened me up and mentally made me into the person I am now.''' ,'''Everybody is likely to make mistakes at times but it's important we learn from it, apologise, recognise where you've gone wrong and keep improving.''' ,'''I work a lot with Duncan Ferguson - and after training - doing finishing drills and how to become a better player.''' ,'''I'm a big admirer of Raheem and I think that he's a big role model for people like myself, young black people and young people as a whole.''' ,'''I've got to prove I'm good enough to play for Everton.''' ,'''I've had my football education in the Premier League in the eyes of everybody to see.''' ,'''I have worked with a lot of different people who have helped me along the way.''' ,'''I'm a student of the game and a fan of football so I enjoy watching other centre-forwards.''' ,'''I just have to keep scoring goals.''' ,'''Every time we lose I just want to play the next one and win.''' ,'''I am just happy to hit the back of the net.''' ,'''Every player wants to start the game, especially me.''' ,'''I am fine-tuning certain aspects of my game. Beforehand, I was guilty of doing a lot of my best work away from the goal. But now I am getting in between the sticks and putting the ball in the back of the net.''' ,'''I enjoy being a presence in the box.''' ,'''I think the more I play, the more goals I will score and will become more prolific because I'm working hard in training to become a better player every day and I do believe I can play for England at some point.''' ,'''My favourite player was Jack Grealish; top man! He is a naturally gifted footballer and for me, he is a joy to watch. If I could watch any player play, it would be him.

All I can do coming off the bench is affect the game and score the goals so hopefully that puts a question mark in the manager's mind.''' ,'''I'm not going to score if I'm out near the corner flag.''' ,'''I love where I am and the position I am in and I love playing for Everton Football Club.''' ,'''It's a dream of mine to play in the Premier League and to make my debut.''' ,'''I always knew to warrant a call-up for my country, it was important that I was doing my job, and that is scoring goals.''' ,'''It's always hard sleeping after an evening game because you have a lot of caffeine for the game and the adrenalin is still going around your body. You go to bed and realise you're still wide awake.''' ,'''I believe in perfect timing.''' ,'''I would have to say my best moment as an Everton player would probably be making my debut against Arsenal, coming on to such a good atmosphere as well.

I am leading the line for Everton so you have to grow into your shoes and carry that weight on your shoulders.''' ,'''I experienced it at Sheffield United, where there were rumours that Everton were coming in for me and I was going there for a million pounds. At that time, I am a kid who uses social media like Twitter. Sheffield United fans were saying they would walk and carry me there, wanting me to go. As a boyhood Sheffield United fan, that still cuts me deep.''' ,'''We're always quick to pigeon-hole players and say 'he's a targetman' or a 'spin-in behind man.' But I think I can bring different aspects of the game and heading is one of my strengths.''' ,'''If you get the cross in there's always a chance I can head it into the back of the net.''' ,'''I am a proud Englishman and proud every time I pull on the England shirt.''' ,'''I've been blessed with the athleticism that I've got. I've worked a little bit to try and fine-tune certain aspects - my pace, leap, timing - to make it work on the football pitch, but I always had it in my armoury being able to jump high.

It teaches you real football and you realise that this game is sink or swim.''' ,'''I can't really affect anything else other than when I'm on the pitch, so I try and concentrate on that.''' ,'''There here has been some exceptional players to wear the No 9 shirt for Everton. For me to get that number, I knew what it meant and I knew what was required.''' ,'''I need to stay consistent, I don't look too far ahead but just affect what I can affect. To be ready in the right place at the right time to put the ball in the back of the net.''' ,'''I have got people around me who will help me keep my feet on the ground. That is the way it has always been.''' ,'''It's definitely not an overnight success. There has been a lot of work, effort and concentration to get where I am now. I've gone through different experiences, good and tough, to mould me into the player I am now.''' ,'''I have to back myself and think if I'm big enough to be picked by Everton and exposed in that situation, then I'm old enough to take whatever comes with it. That's the way I kind of see it.''' ,'''My target from a young boy is to try and reach as far as possible and achieve as much as I possibly can.''' ,'''Some players hit the heights straight away, for me it's been gradual improvement.''' ,'''I think that idea is more an emphasis on being in the right place at the right time, not to say I'm a carbon copy of Inzaghi. I had a little YouTube of his goals, and watched a 15-minute reel of him, and obviously a lot of his goals are one-touch finishes.''' ,'''I'd gone through a lot of ups and downs and learnt from a lot of experiences as a young player joining Everton and playing under pressure.''' ,'''I like to think I've got a bit of everything in my game.''' ,'''I've always believed in myself.''' ,'''If you've got competition for places then you always need to be on top of your game.''' ,'''No matter how good you are, or what level you get to, there's always going to be people that don't think you are very good or have their opinion to say.''' ,'''The only pressure I really feel is that which I put on myself.''' ,'''There are times you start to doubt yourself a little bit but you have to snap out of it.''' ,'''The Premier League is a competitive league where strikers can be brought in for x amount of pounds and it might block your pathway as a young player. To go abroad, if it gives you the opportunity to play at the highest level in that country then I think it's a no-brainer.''' ,'''Being in the best league in the world you are expected to score goals. I am disappointed when that doesn't happen but that is not to say I'm not working on it and trying to improve every day.''' ,'''You don't score 20 goals a season by accident!''' ,'''It's nice to know what I'm working on in training is coming off on the pitch.''' ,'''You could say heading is a dying art in football because a lot of games are now played tiki-taka on the grass.''' ,'''Everton have had great centre-forwards in the past - they are big boots to fill.''' ,'''To have a manager who has worked with top players, top strikers, who have played in my position, it's always nice to know that when he is giving me information, he's coached these players before so it's important I take it on board.''' ,'''With such a big number comes a great responsibility so I have to accept that on my shoulders and live with what comes with it, good and bad. It is not a burden, it is just part and parcel of being a No.9.''' ,'''As footballers we are in a really privileged position so it's good to give back to the community.''' ,'''It was relief really, to know that I have scored on my England debut.''' ,]
