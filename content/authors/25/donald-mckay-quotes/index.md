quotes = ['''Write in a disciplined manner, but write in a way that is natural to the individual's thought processes.''' ,'''My first novel took 12 years to complete because life got in my way.''' ,'''I write when the urge hits me, getting the words down as fast as I can type and then I step back from what I just wrote and start a dialectical process where I begin challenging my own writing.''' ,'''I've been a writer for 42 years and, yes, it is a full time job for me. Not a hobby, but serious work.''' ,'''To come up with the ending to a story and then work backwards is like tying your shoe with one hand only.''' ,'''I do not write by any set time schedule. I realize there are many writers who follow a daily regime where they arise at 6:00 a.m., do some sort of exercise, eat breakfast and then sit down and produce words for a three to four hour period.''' ,]
