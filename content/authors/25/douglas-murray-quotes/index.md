- Audiences I speak to are often openly hostile, and I know my arguments might fall on deaf ears with 99% of the audience.
- You can't get much more egregiously wrong and wicked than the views expressed by al-Muhajiroun.
- I speak at various events, including student societies, several times a week.
- In Israel, you see strong borders as the best way to ensure peace, while in Europe, people see it as a cause of war.
- It's unwise to say nation-states wanting to retain their national identity in Europe should be dissuaded or stopped from doing so. Nationalism can go wrong, sure - but everything can go wrong.
- A good cause need not be tarnished by its most fanatical expressions. But it is rarely helped by them.
- Immigration is the major issue everywhere, and even the countries where it isn't the number one issue, it ends up becoming one.
- There are nutters across every political and religious spectrum; it goes without saying.
- Rather than being a 'perversion' of Islam, it is truer to say that the version of Islam espoused by ISIS, while undoubtedly the worst possible interpretation of Islam, and for Muslims and non-Muslims everywhere obviously the most destructive version of Islam, is nevertheless a plausible interpretation of Islam.
- Londoners say, 'We're so proud of our diversity and tolerance,' but what if that diversity ends up making us intolerant?
- ISIS may seem un-Islamic to President Obama, but to anybody who has read Islam's core texts, it might appear to be a fairly straightforward attempt to create a state based on Mohammed's instructions as laid down in the Koran, in hadith, and in Mohammed's own example.
- Fanaticism is at its very strongest when it has political or, better still, religious motivation.
- Gay men don't have much in common with lesbians.
- For historic reasons - principally the political Right's opposition to gay rights - most gay spokespeople continue to think that the political Right is the sole locale from which anti-gay sentiment can come.
- Fanatics end by subverting their own argument. For instance, animal rights activists have some point, and many people feel sympathy with them. But animal rights fanatics do not have a point. They are the sort of people who threaten human beings in their effort to 'defend' animals.
- Neoconservatism is not what people think it is. It is not a party or a group. Many people popularly seen as neocons - Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld - are no such thing. Most neoconservatives reject the term. And those who accept it generally don't know each other and certainly don't act as the cabal that conspiracy-lovers imagine.
- A fanatic commits to an ideal to whatever end. A fanatic throws everything aside to pursue their idea. Take something which it would be good to be committed to, like basic human rights. You might campaign for such a thing. You might spend every day of your life pursuing such a thing. But once you become fanatical about it, anything can happen.
