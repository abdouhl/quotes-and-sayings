- You've got to embrace those times as a professional player very seriously, because it will come to an end.
- Yes, I've done a lot of things in life, but I've also achieved a lot, I've won trophies. When I was at Sunderland I looked through the dressing room and thought 'who's won anything substantial here?'. Nobody had and yet they all had a flashy car and an opinion.
- Despite all my experience of being a player, I've never had the experience of being a manager which is a different concept from being a coach.
- It's often been discussed, no-one has really taken it up, but I do have a tendency when I speak to everybody, certainly black players who are trying to break into managerial department are coming up against the same concept because of your race.
- I used to play football on the streets, kicking breadfruits or oranges.
- I remember when we were playing Liverpool away from home and we recorded one shot in the whole match. That's not Man United. You want people go out and express themselves.
- Football is a global sport and black players have contributed to the global sport for a number of years.
- People like myself, who have good credibility in the game and played at the very top level, you'd think would get a job or at least be given an interview, but you're not even getting an interview.
- I see managers with my own eyes walking out of jobs and then walking into jobs, getting sacked and then walking back into another job... yet we can't even get an interview.
- If you are on the front foot playing attacking football and you want to score goals, that is what people want to pay money to watch.
- In my time you had to be the main man year after year to be able to demand respect at your club, but now it's too easy because of the financial rewards on offer.
- My first three years at United were pretty much flawless. In the first we won the treble and I finished top scorer: I was walking on cloud nine. I came back the next year and scored 26 goals.
- Everybody can go out and buy fancy things and, while I don't have a problem with that, I do think players should earn the right to say 'I deserve this big contract and all this money'.
- To be a part of the history with the Manchester United club is a huge moment.
- I still love my dad and appreciate what he's done for me, but I despise some of the things he has done to the family and certainly to my mum.
- Look to the Premier League. Are there any black managers? Look at the Italian league? Are there any black managers? The list goes on.
- But to have to have the opportunity to travel to all of these countries, drink some nice wine, see the other side of the culture of these countries I've been to, it's nice.
- But would I give up the women and nights out for another year at United? Would that make me happy? Would that make me the person I am today? I'm not sure. I have no regrets. I went to United to win things and I achieved that.
- I've done all the coaching badges at St George's and the one thing I find very difficult, let alone get a job, is to even get an interview.
- I don't even remember half the places I've been, but it's been a nice journey. I enjoy traveling.
