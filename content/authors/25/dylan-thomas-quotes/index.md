- But time has set its maggot on their track.
- My education was the liberty I had to read indiscriminately and all the time, with my eyes hanging out.
- Every device there is in language is there to be used, if you will. Poets have got to enjoy themselves sometimes, and the twistings and convolutions of words, the inventions and contrivances, are all part of the joy that is part of the painful, voluntary work.
- No honest writer today can possibly avoid being influenced by Freud through his pioneering work into the Unconscious and by the influence of those discoveries on the scientific, philosophic, and artistic work of his contemporaries: but not, by any means, necessarily through Freud's own writing.

- Don't be too harsh to these poems until they're typed. I always think typescript lends some sort of certainty: at least, if the things are bad then, they appear to be bad with conviction.
- Somebody's boring me. I think it's me.
- I've just had eighteen straight whiskies. I think that's the record.
- Never be lucid, never state, if you would be regarded great.
- Go on thinking that you don't need to be read and you'll find that it may become quite true: no one will feel the need tom read it because it is written for yourself alone; and the public won't feel any impulse to gate crash such a private party.
- The first poems I knew were nursery rhymes, and before I could read them for myself, I had come to love just the words of them, the words alone.
