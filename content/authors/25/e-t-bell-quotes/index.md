- Time makes fools of us all. Our only comfort is that greater shall come after us.
- Science makes no pretension to eternal truth or absolute truth.
- I have always hated machinery, and the only machine I ever understood was a wheelbarrow, and that but imperfectly.
- Fashion as King is sometimes a very stupid ruler.
- 'Obvious' is the most dangerous word in mathematics.
- The pursuit of pretty formulas and neat theorems can no doubt quickly degenerate into a silly vice, but so can the quest for austere generalities which are so very general indeed that they are incapable of application to any particular.
- The mistakes and unresolved difficulties of the past in mathematics have always been the opportunities of its future.
- The longer mathematics lives the more abstract - and therefore, possibly also the more practical - it becomes.
- Euclid taught me that without assumptions there is no proof. Therefore, in any argument, examine the assumptions.
- Out of fifty mathematical papers presented in brief at such a meeting, it is a rare mathematician indeed who really understands what more than half a dozen are about.
- It is the perennial youthfulness of mathematics itself which marks it off with a disconcerting immortality from the other sciences.
