- I'll often get obsessed with something for about three days, and I'll be utterly into it, and I'll read every single thing about it possible. And then three days later, I'll just forget about it, and I'll be onto something else.
- I never started collecting figures or anything like that because I'm slightly completist with things, so if I start down a path, I'm worried where it'll end up - i.e. With a wall of something!
- I started stand-up in 2007. I'd done a couple of gigs before that, but not much, and I was in a sketch group at Uni from 2005 as well.
- I read comics and stuff. I buy a lot of comics, a lot of films and boxsets.
