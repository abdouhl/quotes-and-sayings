- I was very worried about being unattractive because I think I look quite masculine. Sometimes I feel more masculine than feminine and I don't like it.
- I've never had a highly developed sense of being female. The sexuality has either been stopped, or else it's been an exaggerated P J Harvey kind of sexuality.

- There were a few singers at home, one or two aunties. We did have a piano but I think that got put on the fire eventually.
- The lyrics tend to fascinate people, but for me, when I listen to a record I don't always latch on to the lyrics. I listen to the whole thing and it may be five or six days before I even realize what the song's about.

- I guess my diction just isn't very good.
- I can't act. I can't lie.
- I had always thought of myself as a sanguine person, quite light and airy. But for a long while, no one could have possibly made me laugh or smile. It was awful.
- I think basically we know how stupid we are, that's why we don't do interviews.
- I've always had a thing about sevens.
- I was able to make up lots of portementos, literally hundreds and hundreds of words... See, I find that mine don't have any meanings. They're not proper. Although I've got a great dictionary of them. It's like the Cockney rhyming slang or something.
- I suspect a singing teacher would have a fit with my diction. They'd probably think I was doing a very bad job.
