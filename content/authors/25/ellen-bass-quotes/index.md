- So much inspires me. People living their lives with courage, beauty of all kinds, nature in all its aspects, people I love and people I hardly know, and, of course, other poets.
- I think many people love poetry who don't know they love it. People are sometimes afraid of poetry, or they've been introduced to poetry that doesn't speak to them.
- Poetry is the most intimate of all writing. I want to speak first from me to myself and then from me to you.
- I live in Santa Cruz. I moved here in 1974 and couldn't leave.
- Garrison Keillor read several of my poems on 'The Writer's Almanac' and I've heard from listeners nationally and internationally. That's one of the great gifts of email.
- I wanted to be a writer since I was in high school, but I never thought it was possible.
