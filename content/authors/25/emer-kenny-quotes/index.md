- But I've never tried writing an episode of 'EastEnders', even as an exercise.
- I don't really miss the life around EastEnders because it's so intense. It's so well-watched that... it's quite a lot... a lot of people recognise you. It kind of takes over your life.
- Actually, I was writing as I was acting - it was kind of simultaneous. I wrote on 'E20', which started this whole 'EastEnders' journey. It's not like I was writing and then I got into acting - they have always been kind of together for me.
- I tell my mum everything. Even things she doesn't want to know.
- I really wanted to create some of my own characters, then it became wanting to act the parts, then it sort of grew from there because I really enjoyed doing it.
- I don't have anyone to be reunited with. My whole reception class is on Facebook.
- I think I'd prefer to write something more youth-orientated, or something to do with people in their 20s or even 30s. 'EastEnders' spans so many generations that I think I'd find it difficult, but I'd love to have a go.
- You can freak yourself out with 'EastEnders'; think about how many people watch it, how long it's been going, it's iconic. But since I've been on it, I've come to terms with it.
