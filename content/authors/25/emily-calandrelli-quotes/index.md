- I want to make everyone believe that they can understand math and science.
- In the grand scheme of things, polar bears are the least of our problems when it comes to climate change.
- Because of engineering, I have been able to experience things I never thought I would be able to do as an undergraduate.
- Being interested in science and engineering is not a male quality.
- Planet Earth is far more resilient than humans and will certainly outlive us.
- Because of technologies from space exploration, we can begin to understand our world's origins, and our lives are improving. These are the reasons why dedicating a life to the sciences and space exploration is so meaningful and rewarding.
- Girls need to see somebody that looks like them talking about science and technology.
- When I got to college, I discovered how many incredible opportunities NASA offered students pursuing a career in the space industry.
- 'The Daily Show' took a topic - politics - which many people considered to be boring, confusing, or even annoying to learn about, and found a way to make it interesting, digestible, and fun. I believe 'Bill Nye Saves the World' can do the same for science.
- Nobody likes feeling like an outsider, so it's intimidating for young girls to give STEM a try when they look into STEM clubs/classes and see a room full of boys.
- I tell students that I believe STEM majors have the most exciting opportunities than any other majors in college.

- In high school, I didn't realize that science or engineering were male-dominated fields. When I got to college, and I was one of two girls in a 50-person class, that's when I realized that this was a unique decision I had made as a girl to go into engineering.
- Representation is so important because it's hard for kids to want to be what they can't see. Little girls and boys need to know that it's natural for girls to love science and tech.
- Sometimes, when you are one of only a couple of girls in an engineering class, you feel like you are representing women in general. That is a large burden to bear.
- I've always been in love with the stars and view the cosmos as the ultimate adventure.
- I wish that I was one of those kids who grew up saying I always wanted to be an astronaut and was really good at science and math. But that wasn't really the case. I always liked it, but I never believed I was one of the smart kids.
- When I got to MIT, I discovered a really interesting Master's program called the Science and Technology and Policy Program - it taught people with a background in STEM how to think about science and tech from a policy perspective. It was a great way to understand how to communicate science to a policymaker or a layperson.
