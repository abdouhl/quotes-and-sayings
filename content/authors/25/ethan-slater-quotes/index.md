- SpongeBob's voice is really pingy and forward and nasally. The problem is, if you live in the extreme of that for more than 10 minutes, it can be a little grating, and it can be hard on your voice. Also, it gets in the way of the acting to be forcing your voice into this place.
- It's inherently a part of my childhood and my development as a person and an artist, this childlike feeling knowing that something is missing but not quite knowing how to fix it. I'm always drawing on it.
