Our factories shuttered, our manufacturing shrank, and we grew more dependent on foreign suppliers.
- Many investors understandably want to do good while also doing well. But the standards for ESG investing are often unclear and sometimes contradictory.
- I am not necessarily my clients. I will seek to defend them, to vindicate their rights but that doesn't mean that I necessarily think that what they did was proper.

- Running a business and need more skilled workers? If you're not considering apprenticeships, then you're behind the curve.
