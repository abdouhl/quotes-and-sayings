quotes = ['''I am one of those from the green movement who recognises the low carbon benefits of nuclear generation.''' ,'''We must face up to the long-term failures of Britain's approach to immigration and make the argument for an effective, compassionate and liberal alternative.''' ,'''If we can speed up the deployment of clean energy technologies in developing countries with investments from the Green Climate Fund, hundreds of millions of people will be able to access electricity for the first time - with all the education, health, communication and entrepreneurial opportunities electricity enables.''' ,'''Climate change is a complex challenge, and one that will not be easily solved.''' ,'''Our party's greatest achievements have always been delivered from the radical centre-left.''' ,'''Solar power - the costs have dramatically fallen, far faster than anyone has speculated. It's probably one of the greatest steps forward in human history.''' ,'''As a carer for my disabled son, I understand just how hard caring is, at the best of times. I know how important it is for families to get the support they need.''' ,'''We are a million miles from the Tories. While we promote international co-operation and human rights abroad, they pull up the drawbridge.''' ,'''The homeless often lose trust in people: in the hospital doctors, who had no choice but to discharge them back on to the streets, and in the family members from whom they have become estranged. Their past use of the NHS can make it difficult to patch together a full medical history.''' ,'''Any genuine progressive should work together to stop Brexit - this is a national emergency, requiring national cooperation.''' ,'''Liberal Democrats will not rest until we have stopped Brexit.''' ,'''What I saw in my first year as secretary of state was a danger that if Britain didn't lead the way on climate change nothing would happen. I thought: If I don't lead, no one else is going to.''' ,'''Liberal Democrats cherish freedom of movement.''' ,'''Energy is one of those things that brings Europe together in terms of our security needs, affordable energy and climate change.''' ,'''British civil society has a fantastic record of campaigning to push politicians of all colours and countries to step up on climate.''' ,'''Liberal Democrats are proud to be the main U.K. political party leading the Remain campaign. Being pro-E.U. is in our DNA: internationalism, tearing down walls rather than building them, is at the heart of who we are as a party.''' ,'''Whenever there's a big national event that brings the country together - whether it's the Olympics, a royal wedding or the 'Bake Off' final - there are inevitably a few contrarian voices speaking out against it.''' ,'''My grandfather was like a father figure to me.''' ,'''Brits, Indians, Frenchmen and Belgians fought side by side in the trenches of the Somme and on the fields of Ypres.''' ,'''Britain's energy markets were a mess in 2010.''' ,'''I'd say that I'm a pro-European.''' ,'''Brexiteers often hark back to the blitz. Maybe they think the 'Britain standing alone' motif adds much-needed heroic purpose to a Brexit future in which Britain stands without trading partners or allies to tackle climate change.''' ,'''My job as energy and climate change secretary is to both power the country and protect the planet. Nuclear power delivers on both of these objectives.''' ,'''Caring is tough.''' ,'''In both world wars, Britain understood that our national sovereignty could only endure if we cooperated with other nations. That our fate is inexorably bound with that of our neighbours.''' ,'''When I was energy and climate change secretary I sat around a cabinet table with Gove, and he couldn't help playing to the Tory climate-sceptic audience. As education secretary, he tried to ban climate change from the geography curriculum. After an angry exchange of letters with me, he eventually backed down.''' ,'''Just as Donald Trump is abrogating America's responsibility to lead the fight against climate change, Theresa May is evading Britain's role.''' ,'''There is nothing triumphant or boastful in the way we mourn the dead and pay our veterans the respect they deserve.''' ,'''Britain needs a diverse energy mix - home grown renewables, new nuclear, a switch from dirty coal to cleaner gas, and, when the technology is ready, carbon capture and storage. Diversity will keep the lights on and ensure we go green at the lowest possible cost.''' ,'''The reality is that no country's actions alone will create the impact required to limit global temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius - we all need to be part of the solution.''' ,'''Putting Michael Gove in charge of the Department of the Environment is much like putting a wolf in charge of the chicken coop.''' ,'''We have been developing an ever closer relationship with China on climate change for many years which has led to collaboration on carbon trading, offshore wind development, on low-carbon buildings, on nuclear energy, and on carbon capture and storage - to name just some of the ways in which we're working together.''' ,'''Diplomacy is essential if we are to find peaceful resolutions in times of tension.''' ,'''We will always be committed to promoting as close a relationship with the E.U. as possible.''' ,'''Climate change remains the biggest threat to our civilisation, economy and security - even bigger than Brexit.''' ,'''We have ensured through the 2013 Energy Act that low-carbon energy resources have a secure future in our energy mix. Wind, tidal, nuclear, biomass and CCS all have a major role to play.''' ,'''We need to invest in home-grown clean energy that will bring cheaper prices in the long run, shielding consumers from volatile international fossil fuel markets.''' ,'''British leadership in Europol has made the law-enforcement agency far more effective, and we have been influential in making human trafficking one of its top priorities.''' ,'''Climate change threatens serious economic disruption to us all with serious implications to global stability and the impact it will have on the whole of humanity.''' ,'''Climate change is putting pressures on the resources we need to survive: water; agricultural land; food.''' ,'''The Liberal Democrats are proud pro-Europeans, and internationalists - and always will be.''' ,'''When we fight to uphold the rule of law, it's vital we uphold the rule of law as we fight. Otherwise we simply play into the hands of the terrorists and undermine our values and system of justice.''' ,'''I'm determined to use all of my powers to make sure that Britain leads the way in sourcing the energy we need from low carbon sources.''' ,'''We want the NHS to be able to recruit the doctors and nurses it needs. And we want British businesses to be free to hire the best workers from anywhere in the world.''' ,'''Slavery is perhaps the greatest affront to the fundamental principle of individual liberty.''' ,'''We want to encourage foreign students to come to our universities - to study, research and teach.''' ,'''From Nato to the U.N. and the E.U., the generation that lived through the first half of the 20th century knew they needed to create a new world order. An order with rules and institutions which, however imperfect, could act both as constraints on individual countries going rogue and as catalysts for co-operation for mutual benefit.''' ,'''For me, the most ironic aspect of the Brexit debate has been right-wing Brexiteers speaking loftily about parliamentary sovereignty, when they have never backed MPs having a fuller involvement in how our country is run.''' ,'''Even before the Windrush scandal, it was clear Britain's immigration system was in desperate need of reform.''' ,'''The union that is the United Kingdom has been extraordinarily successful. Our British family has cooperated brilliantly, working together with shared goals and values, to make a unique four-country multinational success.''' ,'''We fought hard for green taxes and won.''' ,'''Abuse of human rights and international law demand resolution - whoever is responsible.''' ,'''Carers' are all sorts of people. With so many different caring roles.''' ,'''We won't rescue humanity from self-destruction without a dramatic change in how we invest for our future energy needs.''' ,'''You don't need to be a John Maynard Keynes to understand that if Britain leaves the European market, a border will have to be put in place - and that would break U.K. obligations in a treaty lodged at the United Nations.''' ,'''Well, there's always risk in long-term investment.''' ,'''We now have the economics confirming that not only is climate action required to reduce climate risks, but that it is vital to building long-term, sustainable economic growth.''' ,'''Nuclear represents a significant low-carbon opportunity. The electricity it produces is green and reliable.''' ,'''For Liberal Democrats, the political choice between the hard Brexit menus offered by Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt might seem about as tempting as arsenic verses strychnine.''' ,'''My dad had died when I was four, so after my mum passed away, it was her parents - my amazing Nanna and Grandad - who took me in.''' ,'''Tackling climate change is not a luxury for the good times: for good and bad times it has become a necessity - but necessity is the mother of invention.''' ,'''We are strong supporters of energy efficiency. The question is: what is the most appropriate way of doing it?''' ,'''Home-produced energy enhances our energy security and boosts the economy.''' ,'''Climate change threatens the wellbeing of every person around the world and can only be addressed through a global response to reduce emissions.''' ,'''We should be working with our European allies, not turning them into opponents.''' ,'''I am an anti-Conservative politician, and that's how I would lead our party.''' ,'''I've been a young carer, an adult carer and a parent carer.''' ,'''It's crucial we make the case for institutions like Nato and the E.U. as foundations for the peace and prosperity we have enjoyed for decades - and which too many people appear to take for granted.''' ,'''I'm proud to have led the brokering of the ambitious 2030 climate package in the European Union to cut greenhouse gases by at least 40%, which puts the E.U. ahead of the global pack in terms of commitments.''' ,'''Alongside energy efficiency, renewables and abatement, I believe safe nuclear power, with manageable waste, can play an important role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, as long as it is cost competitive with other low carbon generation.''' ,'''What's most disappointing about May's failure on climate change is that Britain played such a pivotal role in securing international agreement on it in the first place.''' ,'''I am not going to give up on renewable energy.''' ,'''Ed Miliband rails against energy companies and says the market isn't working. But wasn't he Britain's first secretary of state for energy and climate change in 2008?''' ,'''When I fought the Tories over climate change and won, more than trebling renewable power with a new subsidy policy combining state intervention with competitive market forces, it was world-beatingly radical.''' ,'''Britain must be the champion of international law.''' ,'''The truth is that E.U. citizens contribute far more to our economy and public services than they use.''' ,'''Offshore oil and gas has proven to be a vital strategic resource for the United Kingdom. Not only has it contributed to Britain's energy security over decades, but it has supported hundreds of thousands of jobs across the country and contributed hundreds of billions of pounds in taxes to the economy.''' ,'''The truth is, it was my Nanna and Grandad who helped me get over my mum's death. Surrounding me with infinite, unquestioning love, they were classic kinship carers.''' ,'''The U.K. has been at the forefront of developing the climate change policy architecture that can ensure climate action is integrated into economic decision making.''' ,'''Jeremy Corbyn's policy on Brexit has failed to unite his own Labour MPs and has been rightly castigated for lacking any clear course.''' ,'''There was a time before my O-levels when I remember thinking I used to study hard and work hard to please my mother, like most young children. And then I realised I'm doing this for me.''' ,'''A credible and effective response to climate change - which protects future generations from an unacceptable level of risk - needs the involvement of all countries.''' ,'''I can't stand by, the Liberal Democrats will not stand by, to see disabled people lose their rights, lose the care they need, when they need it the most.''' ,'''My experience as energy and climate change secretary - in the months I spent battling George Osborne over the budget for investment in low carbon, and in the daily attrition with Eric Pickles over onshore wind - was that many Conservatives simply regard their commitment to climate change action as something they had to say to get into power.''' ,'''Witnessing injustice, in person, leaves an indelible mark.''' ,'''People need to understand what a party is about. And you can't define a party by an issue which will go, which is transitional.''' ,'''I am not a natural fan of Mr Tillerson's political instincts. Indeed, there maybe few things I would agree with Rex on: for example, he vouched his support for the war in Yemen, approved of Assad's regime, and has pushed for tax cuts for American big business.''' ,'''When I visited Jerusalem and the West Bank back in 2008, I was shocked by how individual Palestinians and whole Palestinian communities were treated by the Israeli government. From the illegal settlements to daily humiliations at checkpoints, the evidence of gross injustice and the human suffering it brings is indisputable.''' ,'''I don't ever talk about red lines whether in coalition negotiations with other partners or in Europe. It is important that we listen to others and find a way forward.''' ,'''The Tories wanted to get rid of fuel poverty targets. I stopped them.''' ,'''There is no good time to break the law.''' ,'''No-deal Brexit could be Boris Johnson's biggest deception yet - worse than the Boris bus or the lies that had him sacked as a Times journalist or as a spokesman by the then Tory leader, Michael Howard.''' ,'''On climate change, Britain is leading in Europe.''' ,'''Climate change is hugely threatening to our way of life, in the U.K., Europe and the world.''' ,'''I'm all in favour of talking to other parties, always have been, always will be. I'm a pluralist, talk to them, see what we've got in common, work together, fine.''' ,'''Not having a roof over your head at night must be frightening, cold, lonely and depressing. To be seriously ill as well must be beyond upsetting.''' ,'''One of the most exciting opportunities created by renewable energy technologies like solar is the ability to help the world's poorest develop faster - but more sustainably too.''' ,'''The very idea that human beings are held in bondage is sickening.''' ,'''We should be redoubling our own efforts to combat climate change, not watering them down.''' ,'''By leading on a strong emissions reduction target, the U.K. is persuading others on the need for member states to have the freedom and flexibility to develop their own energy mix to achieve these ambitious reductions.''' ,]
