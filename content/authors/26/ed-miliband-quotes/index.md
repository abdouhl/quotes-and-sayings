- The most important lesson of New Labour is this: Every time we made progress we did it by challenging the conventional wisdom.
- Let the message go out - a new generation has taken charge of Labour which is optimistic about our country, optimistic about our world, optimistic about the power of politics. We are optimistic and together we will change Britain.
- I think the Labour government did good and important things, and it's really important not to undervalue them. I see in my constituency how it helped with education and all those things.
- There was an event called the World Transformed, which was set up by Momentum, and people from across the political spectrum have had to tip their hat to it. It's vibrant, with interesting discussions and ideas. That's why it's such an interesting political moment.
- Let's start to have a grown up debate in this country about who we are and where we want to go and what kind of country we want to build.
- Freedom and opportunity are precious gifts and the purpose of our politics is to expand them, for all our people.
- I don't believe in God personally but I have great respect for those people who do and different people have different religious views in this country.
- Look, there is a sort of old view about class which is a very simplistic view that we have got the working class, the middle class and the upper class, I think it is more complicated than that.
- Well you can be the son of a Marxist and not necessarily be a Marxist in all your views.
- The new generation of Labour is different. Different attitudes, different ideas, different ways of doing politics.
- There just isn't a version of 'socialism in one country' around in the 21st century. I think it's really important that we don't fall for this nirvana of 'Let's just get out, and we can create a socialist Britain.'
- People want bigger, bolder answers to the problems that exist. I felt, as leader, 'My analysis is big; are the answers big enough?'
- Yes, look, social class is definitely an issue in Britain, it is definitely an issue and I think that most people across the country would sympathise with the idea that there are lots of people with talent and ability all across this country who want to make more of themselves and part of the responsibility of government is to make that happen.
- And think of how we challenged the idea of a male dominated Parliament with All-Women shortlists and made the cause of gender equality central to our government. We were right to do so.
- Scepticism and cynicism about politics is so great that one of the best counters to it is what you can do at a local level.
- A company is not accountable just to its owners, but to its workers and its customers.
- I suppose not everyone has a dad who wrote a book saying he didn't believe in the Parliamentary road to socialism.
- While there's capitalism, there'll be socialism, because there is always a response to injustice.
- Do you defend free markets, or do you reform them? It's the same issue that Labour had in the mid-Seventies, and it's the same issue the Tories had after 1945. How do you interact with this new ideological term?
- It's really important to say this. Often the faith schools were founded before the state provided education. I want good education in this country so I'm not going to slag off faith schools. I think that it's important that people of different backgrounds and different faiths go to school together and many faith schools do that.
- Think of how we challenged the impression that we taxed for its own sake and that we were hostile to business. We were right to change.
- I think part of the thing that is important to me, and is important to Labour supporters, is that the fight goes on. The fight goes on in relation to this budget, in relation to Europe, and in a way, the history of progressive politics is that there are setbacks - significant setbacks - and you have to overcome that. But obviously it's tough.
- We began as restless and radical. Remember the spirit of 1997, but by the end of our time in office we had lost our way.
- This idea about cheerful thinking, a digital platform for people to present their ideas, organise events around the country - that is what I am focused on building: a digital think-tank for the modern age that can help show people things can be better; the world can be different.
- The way that you are when you're allowed to be yourself is very different from when you're, say, being interviewed by Jeremy Paxman. You're never given the breathing space.
- Remember, I'm the guy who didn't want the referendum - I wouldn't have had it if I'd been prime minister. But you have to respect how people voted because this was partly about political alienation, so if the response to political alienation is to ignore it, that's a recipe for more political alienation.
- The great thing is that whether we have faith or not, we are by and large very tolerant of people, whatever their particular view.
- You're running to be prime minister - it's hard to be the person who makes jokes.
- I felt I could still make a contribution with ideas. I didn't know how, and it has taken me some time to work that out. There were things that mattered to me about the future of the country: inequality, what the post-financial crisis settlement would be. I still felt strongly about all that.
- My beliefs will run through everything I do. My beliefs, my values are my anchor and when people try to drag me, as I know they will, it is to that sense of right and wrong, that sense of who I am and what I believe, to which I will always hold.
- I come from a generation that suffered school lessons in portacabins and crumbling hospitals. I tell you one thing, for the eighteen years they were in power the Tories did nothing to fix the roof when the sun was shining.
- I want to move to a world of no nuclear weapons but I want to do that through multilateral disarmament so that we all disarm together.
- We do not have to accept the world as we find it. And we have a responsibility to leave our world a better place and never walk by on the other side of injustice.
- The numbers that we can welcome to our own countries are relatively small in comparison to the millions that have been displaced, but it's vital because it sets an example.
- Dominant narrative is so overwhelming in politics. The smallest gaffe when the momentum is against you is a disaster. But when it is with you, everyone just ignores it.
- No one is going to persuade me that eight people arriving in South Shields is going to overwhelm the local system. I think that 25,000 refugees would be more in line with the U.N. That would be a substantive contribution.
