- I tend to wake up around 7, and I start the day with a protein shake.
- My workouts are based on very heavy, fast movements using weights, the science behind it being that the faster you move a weight, the more fast twitch fibres you rip and then repair.
- Yes, I'm doing damage to my body now. The human body isn't designed to be this size.
- Because fats are so calorie-dense - there are nine calories per gram of fat - at 400 grams of fat, you're getting a lot of calories in. It's so easy to digest fat, too. That was my fuel.
- It's that great feeling, like the first man on the moon, the first man to run a mile in under four minutes. And now, I'm the first to deadlift half a ton. It's history, and I'm very proud to be a part of it.
- I remember watching World's Strongest Man as a kid, and I was just obsessed with it. At sort of five, six years old. Just watching these huge guys lift planes, pulls trains, lift stones - I was just mesmerised by it.
- Sometimes I'll have cheesecake - just anything that's high calorie, because that's what I need for the training.
- When I was ten years old, I would get up at 5 in the morning, cycle to the swimming baths, do an hour-and-a-half session, then cycle to school, do a day at school, then cycle back to the baths after.
- My life revolves around World's Strongest Man. I want to be the World's Strongest Man.
- Breakfast is the most important meal of the day; this is where most people will make their first big mistake if they're trying to lose weight.
- For the people that keep asking why I don't compete at the World's Strongest Man anymore, simple: I choose to live a healthier life now and enjoy the fruits of my labour.
- After swimming, I have breakfast. I start with a big bowl of porridge - say, 100 grams of oats - then some cereal, five or so pieces of fruit, an oat bar, a litre of fruit juice, and a big bag of beef jerky.
- I'm not going to walk around at 28 stone until I'm 48. My plan is to win the World's Strongest Man, walk away gracefully, and live a long life.
- No event in strongman competitions lasts longer than 40 seconds, so by swimming in fast bursts, my body is conditioned for the level of speed and power it needs.
- I was expelled from school at 14, and whilst everyone else was studying for their GCSEs, I got a membership for that gym, and I just started lifting weights. So while everyone else was in school, I was in the gym sort of bulking up, and when I got to 17, I got a full time job.
- Coffee... The caffeine in your morning coffee stops an enzyme called amylase from working correctly, which is located in your mouth and gut, and breaks down starchy carbs.
