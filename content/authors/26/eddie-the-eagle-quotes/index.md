- We were not rich by any means. My dad was a plasterer and worked long hours - I hardly ever saw him when I was growing up. He had always gone to work before I woke up, and usually, I would be in bed before he came home.
- I always do the very best I can, and I should be given the opportunity and the right to represent my country.
- If you have got a dream and you've got ambition, then go for it. You know, unless you try, you'll never know.
- When I started competing, I was so broke that I had to tie my helmet with a piece of string. On one jump, the string snapped, and my helmet carried on farther than I did. I may have been the first ski jumper ever beaten by his gear.

- Life is good, and I'm happy, and I don't know that it would be as good if I'd been the winner in Calgary.
- Ski jumping is just 10 per cent physical, 90 per cent mental. Some people can't do that. It's not just to do with the fear at the top. It takes a lot of guts to go off the top, but it takes 100 times more courage to jump off the end.
- The press portrayed me as a joke and a clown.
- As a child, I was always getting into risky situations with the potential to hurt myself, but mum and dad never stopped me doing what I wanted to do, and they assumed that if I fell and hurt myself, I would learn from that and maybe not do it again.
- The worst thing that happened to me as a child was seeing my brother get pushed into a cement mixer.
- I liked being Eddie the Eagle, but I also like being Michael Edwards, plasterer and general builder.
- I actually had huge problems with my glasses steaming up all the time. I had to train very carefully around the limitations caused by wearing them.

- I'm a positive person who likes to have fun and get the best out of every day.

- Some people thought I was bringing the sport down. I don't think so. I was the best and only jumper my country had.

- I was like the George Clooney of the ski business.

- When I plummeted into infamy in the Calgary Olympics, I never thought that a film would be made about my life.

- I wish they'd build a ski jump at the Grand Canyon; it'd be fantastic.
- I'm the Eagle: I can fly.

- Both parents were hard-working and made me work for my pocket money by doing household chores. That taught me the value of money and gave me a strong work ethic.
- I've never really let any kind of negative things affect me, generally. I would take a positive out of the most desperately horrible situation.

- I'm not frightened of death.

- In 1988, I earned something like £700,000. Yeah! I was earning 10 grand an hour opening shopping centres. Yeah! The most I earned in one day was 65 grand. I opened the Alton Towers fun ride in the morning, did a commercial in the afternoon and an appearance at a nightclub in the evening. Sixty-five grand in one day!
- I was a latchkey kid. Every afternoon, I would walk home from school, let myself in, make myself a banana buttie, and watch telly until Mum came home.

- My dentist said my teeth were wearing away at the back because I couldn't bite. My top jaw was broken and brought forward, and my bottom jaw was broken and put back.
- It's not been a bad life, and I do know that I could never have been a world champion. All I ever wanted to do was be the best I could with what I had, which wasn't very much, really. And that's what I think I did.
- If there were some people who considered me a joke, I'm sorry about that. But I did not do it for any other reason except that I loved to ski jump, and I had hopes that by my doing it, other people in my country would take up the sport.
- You've got to think life can give you some bad knocks; no matter how hard you're knocked, you've got to get up.
- People really aren't interested in the way I look. It's my personality they like.

- I was a true amateur and embodied what the Olympic spirit is all about. To me, competing was all that mattered.

- I've got two daughters of my own, and I loved watching my children grow up.
- Americans are very much 'Win! Win! Win!' In England, we don't give a fig whether you win. It's great if you do, but we appreciate those who don't.
