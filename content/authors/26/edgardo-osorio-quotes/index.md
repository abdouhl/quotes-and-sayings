- We do high heels, and people know us for that, but the idea of wearing a flat from day to night feels special.
- My retail partners, they are my brand ambassadors. They're the ones who are selling the shoes to women.
- No one needs anything; they have to want it.
- I got the same industry experience in five years that someone else might have had in 15.
- I was lucky that I started very young, since I had a very clear idea of what I wanted to do. But my father is very conservative, and he never considered fashion to be a real career but something I could pursue as a hobby. He wanted me to be a doctor, and at one point, I thought of becoming a plastic surgeon.
- My shoes aren't minimalist, but they are about a new simplicity.
- I was the first one to say that there could be comfortable, sexy shoes, and it's a big part of our brand.

- For me, it's important that I can talk to my customers all over the world. They can comment on what they like, tell me what fits - we have a daily dialogue.

- Florence is charming, cozy, beautiful, inspiring - it has so many great places to go to and so many unique things to see that you won't find anywhere else!

- Avoid patent leather, pink, and crystals.
- I have so much fun because I love to meet the women who wear my shoes and meet the clients. That, to me, is the best part - getting to know the faces of the people who actually wear my shoes and getting to have a conversation with them.
- I love to turn an idea that is in my head into reality.
- I like statement flats that can take you from day to night.

- People want fashion from us, whereas they might buy core styles from other designers.
- A sexy shoe is one that men like.
- For some reason, many designers are in fashion, but they don't love women. I love women, and I follow my clients on Instagram.
- Being inspired is one thing, but completely knocking off a design is another. There is a big difference.

- I was surrounded by women and all I would hear is of them complaining about their shoes. Back then, 'comfort' was a dirty word in fashion footwear. This was before fur loafers or sneakers. So, I wanted to create a shoe that was like slipping your foot into a glove - something beautiful, feminine, and sexy at the same time.
- Historically, I think you can really judge a person by their shoes.
- Whenever I went to a wedding or a party, girls kept complaining about their shoes. I love to dance, and I wanted them to have shoes they could keep on all night.
- I went to department stores, and there was nothing that I really loved. All the shoes were too complicated, too crazy, too ridiculous, too extreme. The platforms were so high; the shoes were so ugly, covered in crystals and feathers and crap. I just thought, 'Maybe somebody wants a beautifully simple, sexy shoe that they can actually walk in.'

- America is our biggest market, and I really do believe if you can make it in New York, you can make it anywhere.
- For me, I knew the Christy flat was a beautiful shoe, but I had no idea the incredible trend that would follow - I mean, it's the most copied thing ever!
- You can wear a beautiful black dress that you've maybe had for years, but if you wear a fun shoe, you can completely change it. Wear something different, something sexy, something strappy, or something with pom poms.
- I never met a stripe I didn't like.
- There's something special about shoes, they give you a high like nothing else.

- I love art, being so close to the galleries, being by the water - and sunsets from the terrace.
- I wanted to create flats that are as chic as heels - flats you don't have to apologize for.
- It's as if to be interesting, you had to be depressed and messy, but that's complete nonsense.
- Shoes are very emotional. For women, they carry the message that you want to give to the world. One day you want to be sexy, or super powerful at your job - you wear a great pump. If you want to be on-the-go and running after your kids - you wear a great flat.
- I started doing flats because women would always apologize for wearing them when they met me, as if they had to be in heels when meeting a shoe designer.
- When I sit down and design, it's shoes that always appear.
- When I started out, the idea of comfort in shoes was almost a dirty word.
- I've always wanted to create shoes that were positive and happy.
- I want to make shoes that a woman can walk in. That's kind of what they're made for.
