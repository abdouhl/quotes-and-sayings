What can you do to make consumers happy enough with legitimate use of the system that they'll be willing to pay for it?''' ,'''The problem - when you cast your net that wide - is you inevitably catch something you don't want to catch.''' ,'''I think there are problems with compact disc copy protection that can't be resolved.''' ,]
