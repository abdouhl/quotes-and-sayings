I use as little oil as I can possibly help, and that's my method.''' ,'''I trust Winsor and Newton and I paint directly upon it.''' ,'''My aim in painting has always been the most exact transcription possible of my most intimate impression of nature.''' ,'''If I had the energy, I would have done it all over the county.''' ,'''More of me comes out when I improvise.''' ,'''The trend in some of the contemporary movements in art, but by no means all, seems to deny this ideal and to me appears to lead to a purely decorative conception of painting.''' ,'''I think that zinc white has a property of scaling and cracking.''' ,'''After all, we are not French and never can be, and any attempt to be so is to deny our inheritance and to try to impose upon ourselves a character that can be nothing but a veneer upon the surface.''' ,'''If the picture needs varnishing later, I allow a restorer to do that, if there's any restoring necessary.''' ,'''I have tried to present my sensations in what is the most congenial and impressive form possible to me.''' ,]
