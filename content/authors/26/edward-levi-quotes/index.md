- The introduction of many minds into many fields of learning along a broad spectrum keeps alive questions about the accessibility, if not the unity, of knowledge.
- The role of a liberal arts college within a university is to be a genuine part of that university, giving and responding to the other parts.
- Universities are the custodians not only of the many cultures of man, but of the rational process itself.
- Law builds upon and, I should like to claim, is one of the liberal arts. It uses words of persuasion and changing definitions for practical ends.
- As an instrument for practical action, law is responsive to the wisdom of its time, which may be wrong, but it carries forward, sometimes in opposition to this wisdom or passion, a memory of received values.

- The University conceives of itself as dedicated to the power of the intellect. Its commitment is to the way of reason.
