I believe in a one-state solution.''' ,'''When you become a public figure, you still think, 'That's really not me; there's more to me than that.'''' ,'''Since the time of Homer every European, in what he could say about the Orient, was a racist, an imperialist, and almost totally ethnocentric.''' ,'''I have been unable to live an uncommitted or suspended life.
