- The audience is smart and catch on pretty quick when they are sold the same old thing.
- I've worked on some movies that get put in the horror shelf on the video stores, but they're really structurally like mysteries, and not so dependent on the gore factor, so they really don't need to be R-rated movies.
- I've watched 'Ringu' probably three or four times before writing the first draft of 'The Ring.' And then I'd seen 'Ringu 2' I think once.
