- Most of our models have just walked in off the streets, although I also find them on countless trips to Europe - particularly Scandinavia. I operate by instinct. It's a process I cannot explain, but the prettiest girl on the block is not always the best model.
- I don't think of people as black or white. It's a question of are they photogenic or not? I don't think anyone says, 'Let's book her. She's black.' I think they say, 'Let's book her. She's good.' We've come that far.
- Our business was built on trust.
- Most models are emotionally abandoned. They need me. I'm their mother.
- My family believed I could do no wrong. That's probably why I have utter confidence in myself even when I shouldn't have.
- None of the people I grew up with had identity problems. We all had perfectly marvelous lives.
- I create a look, and I create a style.
- I see girls that I know - I absolutely know - will be star models within just a matter of weeks, and they always are.
- I can't add above 10, I can't draw a stick figure, and I'm tone deaf. So I had to be able to do something. I found that something was picking successful models.
- American women mean a great deal to me. They're such lost souls, particularly the women of my generation. And women need so much help. They never have anyone to turn to. I help them understand how they can look better, how to do this, do that, get a job. And they're very trusting. Like little lost kids.
- I had a nice, pert nose but a plain round face and a mop of curly brown hair. That was not the photograph of a successful model.
- I really prefer light-eyed models, They photograph more easily. Of course, I come from a light-eyed background, so maybe that influenced my taste.
- I never worry about fat people worrying about thin people, because slender people bury the dead.
- I feel that my ideas of beauty have been given very strong backing by Botticelli and a few others: Slender hands, long neck, long limbs - look at Nefertiti. She was very teensy-weensy with a long neck and wide-spaced eyes.
- Grace Kelly was a very commercial model; she had no interest in being a fashion model. None at all.
- Jerry didn't know he wanted to get married until he was married.
- I got everything I wanted from my parents: Brooks Brothers sweaters and Spalding saddle shoes.
- You never know when or where you will find the next new model, but you can bet someone from Ford Models will be looking.
- I suppose you could say that I majored in men and minored in psychology.
- I'm afraid to go to sleep; I don't like to lose control of myself. I don't like chauffeurs, either. I like to be in charge of my own destiny.
- We couldn't afford to move, so we decided to start up a model agency.
- I interview about three thousand models yearly, and I must see almost 20 tons of excess avoirdupois annually.
- The horrible thing about being me is that I have a very good eye about what people look like. Even me.
- Models are a business, and they have to treat themselves as a business, which means they have to take care of themselves and give up all the young joys.
- I live in a wonderful world of make-believe. A world of Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire. A world of Winnie the Pooh and Edward Bear. Things like that. Wonderful things. Funny things.
