Instead, it destroyed trade so effectively that by 1932, American exports to Europe were just a third of what they had been in 1929. World trade fell two-thirds as other nations retaliated. Jobs evaporated.''' ,'''We need long-term tax reform that promotes private sector job creation. And legislated mandates that kill jobs by raising the cost of payrolls need to be eliminated.''' ,'''The work of these women doesn't end when they return home from overseas, as one goal of the Peace Corps' mission is to help promote a better understanding of other cultures here in the United States.''' ,'''Capital available for individuals to start and expand businesses would increase with regulatory and strategic tax reforms, like reducing marginal rates, repealing the alternative minimum tax, and making the U.S. the most welcoming place for employers to relocate and create jobs.''' ,'''The ingenuity and creativity of the private sector is essential to meeting American's needs for a skilled work force.''' ,'''I know what it is like to feel vulnerable and fearful during a difficult time.''' ,'''The Obama administration's zeal to not 'waste a good crisis,' as Secretary of State Hillary Clinton put it, has been stunning even for Washington insiders to behold.''' ,'''There are many reasons to worry; the evening news is full of them.''' ,'''Those memories of living in a developing nation are part of who I am today and give me a profound understanding of the challenges of economic development - an understanding which will make my tenure as Peace Corps director, I hope, a very special one.''' ,'''Even if it's a national issue, the federal government cannot provide all the answers.''' ,'''In normal times, laid-off workers are unemployed an average of eight weeks.''' ,'''When my mother, sisters and I arrived on the shores of America when I was 8 years old, the boat on which we came, a freighter, passed the Statue of Liberty.''' ,'''We are a Republic with different branches of government, and so the Senate and the House are going to be full partners in working with the White House.''' ,'''To foster entrepreneurship, expansion and job creation, more leaders at all levels of government have to demonstrate some understanding of what it takes to build and grow businesses in the private sector.''' ,'''There should be an immediate moratorium on federal regulations that endanger jobs.''' ,'''The borrow-spend-and-centralize agenda that has been so destructive to job creation elsewhere in America has been a gravy boat inside the Beltway.''' ,'''To maintain their own competitiveness, workers need to attain and stay current on the qualifications needed to advance in a constantly evolving economy.''' ,'''It has long been said the only things in life that are certain are death and taxes. Automatic enrollment for insurance of 401k loans would add an additional certainty.

But nearly always, a simultaneous and even greater burst of new jobs has been created to offset the jobs lost - millions of new jobs every year.''' ,'''Deep in the heart of Kentucky's rugged Eastern Mountain region, there lives a woman who has fascinated and inspired me for two decades. She is known locally these days as 'Mayor Nan' - the octogenarian chief executive of Hazard and advocate for its 5,467 residents.''' ,'''We have many rules and regulations that can be sometimes confusing and complicated. By reaching out to the employer community and educating them on what their responsibilities and obligations are to their work force, that, along, with strong enforcement, is the best way to protect workers.''' ,'''In the best of years, millions of jobs are lost.''' ,'''As I looked up at the Statue of Liberty, I thought at that time, 'What a wonderful country.'''' ,'''Activists have every right to espouse their views of utopia.''' ,'''Confidence, capital, and credit fuel entrepreneurship and economic expansion.''' ,'''Nan Gorman was born in Memphis, Tenn., on St. Patrick's Day.
