- I really enjoy spending time at home.
- I hate, hate Times Square!
- I didn't go to university, and I always had in my mind that I hadn't studied properly.
- I don't know if vocally I am so great.
- I went to the Conservatory, studying piano and singing, up to high school - but I only did four years because I then had to start working, and the jobs were so good that I didn't stop.
- At the age of 15 I began my singing lessons, and once I became a professional performer, I dove into acting.
- I keep everything fans give me, if I can, but I do worry about when I run out of room in my house!
- Sunday is the day I connect with Buenos Aires. I speak to or text my mother every day, but on Sunday I phone everyone.
- My grandmother taught me to knit, and as I knit, my mind returns to my childhood.
- I am not normal.
- I thought that I'd never be able to work in films or TV. Another girl would be cutting her nose to be an actress. I was always very sure about myself.
- 'Piaf' I did it because I wanted to do more theater instead of only musicals, and someone gave me the book and said to me, 'You have to do it.'
- I like to tell stories through dancing and singing.
- I met Patti LuPone and Elaine Paige in a party. I didn't speak too much with Patti, but she was lovely with me.
- In Buenos Aires, I have a very close friend who speaks very good English, and she taught me. It was quite difficult because the muscles of your mouth are used to your language, and then when you want to speak another language, they don't go to the place they need to go to make the sound.
- Sometimes Buenos Aires is not so safe. You are scared to have someone behind you at night.
- When I am working, I have two shows on Saturday, and when I wake up, and it's a lovely day, I just cry. I'm joking: I love my job.
- I know I want to work for my whole life because I know I can't live without music or dancing. But I don't know if I want to be a big star.
- I love to be awful. There's nothing wrong with being awful.
- I remember one director in Argentina said to me, 'You are not going to have any opportunity to be a leading lady because of your height.' And I didn't care. I don't have a complex.
- I feel that working now is the way for me to learn things, whether it's languages or another activity.
- I've never been punched in the face, so I didn't know it would hurt so much!
- I would like to play Broadway!
- London has this culture of the theatre that is so big, it was a like a dream - but I never had a thought to be able to play here because my English was not very good. So being given the opportunity to come work here was like a gift.
