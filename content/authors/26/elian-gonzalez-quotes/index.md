- I'd like to go to Cuba.
- Fidel Castro for me is like a father.
- Because he'll take me to Cuba and I don't want to go to Cuba.
- It's the least that someone can do, someone like me that owes so much to this people and to the revolution: study hard, but more than that, defend them under any circumstance.
- I don't profess to have any religion, but if I did, my God would be Fidel Castro. He is like a ship that knew to take his crew on the right path.
- Wherever I go, there's always a child, an old woman, that comes to me and wants to meet me. Not because I am famous but because they suffered with my family.
