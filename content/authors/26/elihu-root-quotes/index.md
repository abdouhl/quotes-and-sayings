they give up trying.''' ,'''The methods of peace propaganda which aim at establishing peace doctrine by argument and by creating a feeling favorable to peace in general seem to fall short of reaching the springs of human action and of dealing with the causes of the conduct which they seek to modify.''' ,'''The line of least resistance in the progress of civilization is to make that theoretical postulate real by the continually increasing force of the world's public opinion.''' ,'''The theoretical postulate of all diplomatic discussion between nations is the assumed willingness of every nation to do justice.''' ,'''Human life is held in much higher esteem, and the taking of it, whether in private quarrel or by judicial procedure, is looked upon much more seriously than it was formerly.''' ,'''No nation now sets forth to despoil another upon the avowed ground that it desires the spoils.''' ,'''The growth of modern constitutional government compels for its successful practice the exercise of reason and considerate judgment by the individual citizens who constitute the electorate.''' ,'''Gradually, everything that happens in the world is coming to be of interest everywhere in the world, and, gradually, thoughtful men and women everywhere are sitting in judgment upon the conduct of all nations.''' ,'''Honest people, mistakenly believing in the justice of their cause, are led to support injustice.''' ,]
