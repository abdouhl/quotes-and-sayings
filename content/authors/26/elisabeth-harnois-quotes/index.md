I just feel happier and more motivated to do things.''' ,'''That's an amazing gift as an actor - to be able to say I have an audience in so many countries in the world and that people know my work.''' ,'''Whether it's a blessing or a curse, I have always played someone like 10 years younger. When I was 23 or 24, I was playing 15 opposite Evan Rachel Wood in a movie called 'Pretty Persuasion.'
