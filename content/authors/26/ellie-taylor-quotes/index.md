- My sister told me: 'You need to have a baby so that you've got someone to look after you when you're old.' And I was like: 'Hang on - I thought that's what the NHS was for? Unless the NHS is that screwed by the time I'm old, you've literally had to give birth to your own medical professional.'
- Hogwarts is comforting.
- The high of a great set is better than anything.
- Don't get me wrong. I don't have a problem with anyone being proud to be a parent. I love children, some of my best friends used to be children. But I was fed up of these 'competitions,' so I decided to do the opposite, I decided to do the non-motherhood challenge and post five photos of myself which made me proud not to be a mother.
- I'm definitely my worst critic. I guess that's good because it keeps you on your toes.
- I feel like the timbre of your voice as a woman doesn't cut through as well as a loud bassy voice, so you need to noticeably speak up.
- I went out with a guy from Wolverhampton once. He took me to watch a Wolves match. A man in the seat behind me burned a hole in my coat with a cigarette.
- I remember I quite liked 'SingStar' for a while.
- Playing the Hammersmith Apollo was pretty special.
- There was the phase I went through where I'd put streaks of red food colouring in my fringe as some kind of budget instant hair dye. Fine until it rained and I looked like I'd had a head injury.

- I started comedy as a hobby with no intention of making it my career.
- I feel like everyone could do with starting wearing SPF at least a decade earlier than they do, just for ageing.
- I have no maternal instincts.
- I want to do everything, so when I started I wanted to be an actress, and I've always written funny things. I love that; it gives me a real sense of achievement and joy. I also love presenting. I'd never been interested in it before but found it pretty fun and easy, and I really enjoyed working with a group - standup is so lonely.
- I wear a lot of black, floaty things, but I've got lots of bright, flowery stuff, too.
- When I was younger it was people like Victoria Wood who I loved.
- I'm quite ungainly.
- Nothing gets a party started like some 110 per cent proof Ouzo from Kavos circa 2002.
- Lots of people do stand up shows with no narrative, but I love a beginning, a middle and an end.
- I've had some bad gigs, don't get me wrong.
- I'm always in comfy clothes.
- I was a massive geek.
- If I see a baby, I don't feel anything. It's like Theresa May walking past a homeless person.
- If you haven't truly died a million times as a comic you haven't gigged enough!
- I can't drink anything after 9 P.M. otherwise I'm up all night.
- I tend to read quite serious things in order to try and appear superior.
- I'd like to be on 'Graham Norton.' Just because I used to do the audience warm-up for the 'Graham Norton' show, and I just think that would be a beautifully lovely, typical end to a narrative. I like a neat ending.
- When I've been on shows as a guest, I'm backstage, so I don't usually hear what the warm-up is saying, so I went and watched a couple of people do it and thought, 'Actually, I reckon this is do-able.' The audience is usually excited to be there; it's just getting a good chat with people.
- I was always the tallest. I was five foot seven when I finished junior school.
- I want a dragon.
- I prefer clothes with a waist rather than boxy shapes.
- I did a standup show called 'Show Me the Funny,' so from that I got some TV stuff and people would book me for gigs. I wasn't really good enough at that point, so had to catch up with expectations.
- I would like to go to the Oscars. I'm not even talking about being nominated - although that would be lovely. Even if it was I won a competition on the back of a crisp packet to go to the Oscars I would like to go to the Oscars.
- Everyone knows the feeling where you're in the pub and you make your mates laugh. It's awesome, you feel like you rock. That's what comedians want with a bit of extra ego.
- The real pleasure of cruising is arriving at a new destination.
- With social distancing restrictions in place, many are finding themselves isolated from their support networks and suddenly navigating parenthood differently than they expected.

- I was working in a day job in marketing but I had my sights on doing an open-mic night.
- I once hosted the Butcher Shop of the Year Awards. There's nothing like performing to the personification of the phrase a 'sausage fest' to hammer home how you've hit the big time.
- I reckon I'm in pyjamas 70 per cent of my life. But I do love getting dressed up, too.
- I'm not interested in babies at all. Babies to me are like wasps: pointless, irritating and even one can ruin a picnic. They're just not my bag at all.
- I always showed off when I was a kid.
- There's always someone out there being mean, but what upsets me is the spite. Why are you like that? Why are you so horrible?
- People who have heard of me have heard of me mostly through presenting and asked, 'Why have you gone into comedy?'
- In group situations, I tend to be the quiet one.
- I drink loads of water.
- I was never thin enough to be a proper model and not big enough to be plus-size.
- Show Me The Funny' was not very successful ratings wise, but the right people saw me.
