- I grew up working in Canada so everything was low budget.
- I think the Smart Car is awesome. The only problem is I've been on the freeway and felt like I was going to be blown away like a Tim Hortons coffee cup, so I may have to upgrade to a Mini Cooper - something a little stronger.
- To be in a position, at my age, where I am financially independent, I can help develop things, I can promote stuff that I believe in, I can say no a lot and spend time writing - that is a gift.
- Fashion once meant dresses and heels, and I didn't know why I'd want to be dressed that way. Now I'm like, 'Oh my God, those Saint Laurent boots!' Those are not words I thought I'd ever say. A beautiful suit is nice. I get fashion now. In fact, I love it.
- I don't really want to do the Hollywood thing. I think you ought to try to say something with your movies.
- I don't want to become unhealthily attached to what I do. I'm grateful for what I do, but I also want to be able to be OK when I'm not doing it.
- People ask if I'm concerned about getting pigeonholed. No one asks, 'Ellen, you've done seven straight roles in a row. Shouldn't you shake it up, do something queer?' There's still that double standard.
- I've become really interested in permaculture, simplifying my life and doing everything I can to develop more of a sustainable lifestyle.
- I actually can't watch blood and gore and all those things. I watch Netflix shows with my hand over my face, like, peeking out. Which is funny, because I'm on sets all the time, and I know how those effects are done.
- I think, because I've been working for a while, I've been working since I was ten, I had the fortune of reading a lot, a lot of scripts.
- I wish I was a teenager in the 1970s.
- I think it's obvious when you're watching a movie, and there's people fighting or someone's slipping on the side of the building, that it's fake and it really removes you from it.
- I'm a huge Sissy Spacek fan.
- I'm a huge fan of the program 'Democracy Now,' which is hosted by Amy Goodman, and I subscribe to the podcast.
- The thing that I would say you get the most hate about on social media, in my experience, is if you tweet anything about women's rights or feminism. It blows my mind. But it's the thought of not being a feminist that actually blows my mind.
- When I feel strongly about something, I'm not so quiet.
- I didn't really play dress up when I was a kid, and I'm really T-shirt and jeans-y.
- I was maybe 10 or 11 when I saw 'Titanic.' And, yes, I was a fan. I loved it.
- The relationships I've had with my girl friends are so powerful and meaningful. Without them I truly don't know what I'd do.
- I love sport, I grew up playing sports, that's all I did, and it is so invigorating now that I'm supposedly adult to learn something completely new, from the bottom up.

- I have trouble sometimes watching actors - even when they do a great job - with an accent.
- There's no big budget Canadian movie. Whatever movies are big budget in Canada come from the States. Or also have States financing. Everything's pretty small.
- There's obviously a lot of tragedy in comedy; I really enjoy the paradox of what a really good comedy is.
- I'm not good at watching stuff that I'm in at all. I should stop. I shouldn't watch something for the first time with a room full of people at Sundance. It's not a good idea.
- I always take the time to eat well and eat locally because it's common sense.
- Conversations create change. It's easy to call someone 'enemy,' but there's more to it, right?

- X-Men is massive, like nothing I've ever experienced. But great in its own way.
- And I've shot in Prince Edward Island winters, I mean, I've shot in some intense, intense temperatures.
- I hate how box-office failures are blamed on an actress, yet I don't see a box-office failure blamed on men.

- I'd ice-skated before, because I'm Canadian and that's what you do as a kid, but I'd never, ever been on quad skates.
- Mind you, Roman Holiday - which is kind of a romantic comedy - is one of my favorite films, and I think Audrey Hepburn is absolutely phenomenal in that movie.
- Yeah, people following me down the street and at the airport and all that. I can't imagine what it must be like for people who are, you know, actually famous.
- I love nicknames. It makes me feel loved. It makes me feel less alone in this world.
- And I think it's really easy for people to point out hypocrisy in people's lives.

- I think a lot of the time in films, men get roles where they create their own destiny and women are just tools, supporters for that.
