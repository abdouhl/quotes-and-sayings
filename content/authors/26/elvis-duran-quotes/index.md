- I've always been very comfortable with me and the people I work with, and my family have always been very plugged into who I am with my personal life.
- I'm still me, no matter if I'm gay or straight or whatever.
- I have no desire to spend my off-hours listening to other shows. Unless it's Howard Stern, of course.
- I used to come to the gay pride parades in New York. I've been to a few down in Miami Beach, if memory serves.
- I had a little radio, and I listened to music in my bedroom when I was supposed to be sleeping. I was probably 6 or 7 years old, and I loved the DJs who would come on and talk about the artists and the songs they were singing, and they gave away prizes. I was like, 'This is a cool job!'
- I never graduated from college. While I was in a mass communication class at North Texas State University, I was on the air weekends in Dallas and knew more about major-market radio than the guy teaching. When I told him that, he failed me.
- I definitely don't ever see a time I want to retire. Ever.
- Having the gastric sleeve procedure and losing 120 pounds, it was a huge difference in how I look in such a short amount of time. It really garnered all the attention.
- I have no problem with someone who disagrees with my life. That's your right to feel that way.
- I think interviews are good when you are an actual fan of the person you are interviewing.
- If an artist is going through a lot of bad publicity, I don't want to ask them about that. If they want to talk about it, I'll make them comfortable enough where they can bring that up on their own. Not only do I want them to feel comfortable, I want them to come back.
- I love what I do. I love the music, and I'm honored to be presented with a star by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce.
- Crank-calling people is the oldest bit in the world.
- I miss being able to pig out sometimes.
- One of our rules for the show, I guess the filter we try to pass everything through, is it's a safe place for women to be. It's not a show for women, because we're basically 50/50 men/women in our audience, but it's a safe place where women win. Women never lose on our show. I think that's very important. It's very unusual.
- I just always assume no one is listening.
- To be the Grand Marshal of the most recognized Halloween parade in the world is so much fun. People plan for months and months to design their costumes, and it is amazing. It is a true competition and amazing to watch everyone.
- Here at Z100, we're kind of famous for breaking new artists and watching their careers bloom.
- I'd love to write a book and dabble in TV a little more - but only if it's right. I'm not going to go out there and beg anyone for a job.
- I wash my own dishes; I do my own laundry. I'm not a glamorous person at all, not at all.
- I was never hiding from being gay; I just never talked about it.
- One thing that makes me optimistic is other media from the digital world coming at radio. MTV tried to kill the radio star back in the '80s. And with all the digital services coming at us, people say it's a thing of the past - it's not.
- I really feel that leading by example is the best way for people to see who you are and let them connect with you.
- Radio was always a fun, geeky thing to be a fan of - the history of radio, where it is, and where it's going - but it was really also a pretty easy job.
- If I played golf, I'd be on the golf course every day, but I just can't wear those dumb pants.
- I was sort of a loner as a kid, so radio was where I turned for companionship. I loved the music and how the DJs talked about the artists and used words to paint pictures to evoke emotion.
- As far as radio goes, it really isn't what listeners get; it's how they get it. Social media gives us new and fun ways to stay more directly connected to people who listen to us, and it also helps us make decisions faster.
- To meet an artist when they first start out is like having a seat on the 50-yard line and watching them get a touchdown... The Weeknd, Pink, Harry Styles, Lorde, Miley Cyrus, Niall Horan, Kesha - these are all artists I interviewed back before anyone knew who they were. To watch them turn into these superstars is just amazing.
- I think it's a wonderful thing, turning 50. I think everyone should do it at least once.
- Radio in my beginning days was going into a room for four hours, playing a bunch of music, and screaming about the artists... radio now has come out of the radio, on to the net, and on to video and on stages; it's a multiplatform thing. It's nothing I expected ever to see.
- I grew up in the age of radio where we just went wherever the jobs were available. The job doing afternoons at Z100 was, funny enough, the only job I could find.
- Sometimes fame overshadows an artist's music, and we forget just how incredibly talented these people truly are.
- My voice was awkward. I had a deep Texan accent.
- If you're born and raised a New Yorker, you're probably pretty to-the-point, and you don't care so much about hurting people's feelings as you do about saying what's on your mind, because you assume they'll get over it.
- The only thing about politics I do discuss is, be into them: Read what's online. Read what the candidates are talking about. Try to understand why people are fighting over what the candidates are standing for.
- Radio isn't just a jukebox for music anymore because you can get music anywhere.
- Halloween is not only about putting on a costume, but it's about finding the imagination and costume within ourselves.
- I don't think of me as, quote, 'coming out,' because I was never 'in.' I rarely, if ever, spoke about my private life and remain as neutral as possible.
- Traditional radio is not going to die; it's going to evolve.
- I really think there are many great organizations out there getting the word out about LGBT youth and bullying, but GLAAD has this way of making sure the stories about gay people are sent out and heard and not covered up, and I like that.
- Our sole mission on this show is to make people think, make people feel, and make people happy as much as we can.
- The magic to our show and, I think, any successful show, be it on the radio or TV, is every person being true to themselves.
- I love taking time with an interview. Time with an artist relaxes them; it makes them want to be there and answer all your questions.
- I don't think we have to make a big thing about being gay, except for when we get together for these gay pride events.
- I've found in the past that if we planned the show a night before, once we slept and woke up, we weren't in that mood anymore. Because I really think doing a live show means you should be exploring your live feelings, and planning is not good.
- I look at old pictures of me... and I don't feel like I'm that guy anymore, but then I look at pictures of me now, and I'm not quite sure I'm this guy.
- At 14, I began working in radio. I ran the board at a little radio station in Dallas.
- Social media has given us the world at our fingertips every morning. And we watch it change, live. In the morning, in the old days, we'd read the 'Post,' and that was what we had.
- I've never been truly closeted on the air; it's just something I never really made a big deal out of because I never felt like I wanted to push an agenda or push it any further than I felt comfortable with.
- I love Justin Bieber. There are times where people only report negative things about him, but everyone forgets how incredibly talented he really is.
- I am honored to be named Godfather for Norwegian Bliss. This incredible ship and all the innovative activities onboard, from the race track to Broadway shows, perfectly reflect the energy and excitement of our morning show, and we are looking forward to bringing our loyal listeners along for this once-in-a-lifetime experience.
- I have no deep desire to hit the pavement and audition for TV projects or raise money to produce a show.
- I happen to know personally that Donald Trump does not have a problem with gay people.
- I never interned. The first job I ever had was a very low-paying job, and the guy running the radio station was so poor, he couldn't pay us sometimes - so it's almost like an internship, right?
