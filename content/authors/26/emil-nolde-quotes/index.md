- Clever people master life; the wise illuminate it and create fresh difficulties.
- What an artist learns matters little. What he himself discovers has a real worth for him, and gives him the necessary incitement to work.
- Art is exalted above religion and race. Not a single solitary soul these days believes in the religions of the Assyrians, the Egyptians and the Greeks... Only their art, whenever it was beautiful, stands proud and exalted, rising above all time.
- The artist need not know very much; best of all let him work instinctively and paint as naturally as he breathes or walks.
- The art of an artist must be his own art. It is... always a continuous chain of little inventions, little technical discoveries of one's own, in one's relation to the tool, the material and the colors.
