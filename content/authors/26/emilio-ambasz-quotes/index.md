quotes = ['''I was born in Argentina, June 13, 1943. I brought up my parents very well, so they let me come to America to study at Princeton University.''' ,'''My first architectural project I did, I must have been fifteen, was for neighbors across the street, a couple of school teachers, and I designed a house for them. I didn't know anything about Le Corbusier or anything like that, but it ended up being a very cubistic kind of house. I always wanted to be an architect.''' ,'''Argentina is a marvelous place. Argentines are great bankers of information. They import information; if someone sneezes in Milan or in New York, they clean their faces very fast there.''' ,'''Princeton is a sublime undergraduate university. It has a good architecture school.''' ,]
