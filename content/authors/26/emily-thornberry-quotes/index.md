quotes = ['''The principle behind the Equal Pay Act is that if an individual woman finds a man doing similar work and being paid more she can take her employer to a tribunal and get paid equally and compensated. Sounds simple enough. But in reality this law has been hamstrung by a series of stupid loopholes that have developed over the years.''' ,'''White collar crime must be taken as seriously as any other crime.''' ,'''I certainly think sometimes when it comes to sexism, some Sky presenters need to look at themselves.''' ,'''Whatever people's backgrounds or values, a society where more and more people face a daily struggle to house, clothe and even feed themselves and their families cannot possibly be the answer.''' ,'''We need to have a system whereby, when a victim walks into a police station, she can be confident that she will be believed and that every effort will be made find evidence to support her in court.''' ,'''We need a foreign policy which responds to challenges like forced marriage, and which speaks to the particular needs of women and girls at risk of being sold into slavery.''' ,'''I don't think you negotiate with people by going around telling them that they're like Nazi guards or it's all about prosecco.''' ,'''First-past-the-post builds a direct relationship between a community and their MP. Residents come together to decide who most people want as their national representative. No one has more than one vote and it has to be cast responsibly.''' ,'''I don't think we should be undermining our democracy.''' ,'''Prosperity need not come at the expense of this country's proudest traditions as a beacon of justice.''' ,'''Unesco can rightly be claimed as one of Britain's greatest contributions to that global architecture of peace, and for Penny Mordaunt to be willing to destroy that legacy by withdrawing Britain's membership is nothing but historical and cultural vandalism.''' ,'''My European constituents are among the most politically engaged people I represent.''' ,'''Given that GPs are essentially a private part of our health care system, providing services independently of the rest of the health service, NHS England is supposed to take a strategic approach to co-ordinating GP practices.''' ,'''Labour is fundamentally a Remain party but it is in our interests to negotiate as good a deal as possible.''' ,'''The destructive impact of employment tribunal fees, which were introduced in 2013, is by now well known.''' ,'''If I had a row with my husband, it's not going to work my saying, 'Right, if you don't do what I want, I'm going to walk out.' It doesn't work on any level. What you do is you go in and you say, 'I have a problem. You have a problem. Let's try and sort this out together.' You don't come to an agreement with people who you're falling out with badly.''' ,'''When one party is really unpopular, like the Conservatives in 1997, AV can really skew the result disproportionately against them.''' ,'''Everybody gets paranoid about deselections. I do.''' ,'''Equal constituencies' sound fair. So why is Labour so against the constituencies bill and why do we call it gerrymandering? Because, like so much Tory rhetoric, it sounds good, but if we look beyond the soundbites it becomes clear that it covers policies that promote narrow sectional interests.''' ,'''It has always been the case that people on out-of-work benefits have to apply for more or less any job they can reasonably be expected to take. But the operative word there is 'reasonable,' because a job that's appropriate for a single, able bodied 22-year-old man may very well not be appropriate for a single mum who can't afford childcare.''' ,'''The social safety net was created by a united society in the aftermath of the Second World War. It came out of a British sense of fairness.''' ,'''Whether it's in Jobcentres or in Whitehall, young people are constantly coming up against a narrative that portrays them as lazy and feckless, when in reality nothing could be further from the truth.''' ,'''Help to Work' always felt like a singularly inappropriate name for a scheme which had the express intention of 'stepping up the pressure' on the long-term unemployed, rather than actually helping them into work.''' ,'''The right to strike is one of the most important safeguards working people have in this country. It's a weapon of last resort that has served throughout history as a bargaining tool which allows unions to push for recognition of ordinary workers' rights to be paid fairly and treated with dignity.''' ,'''Where there are breaches of human rights, you need to speak out about it, no matter where it is.''' ,'''It is up to Labour to keep alive the belief that government should be for the whole nation and that no section of society should place itself beyond scrutiny and above the law.''' ,'''I went to this rubbish school. I asked the careers master what he thought that I was going to do with my life, and he said I could always visit criminals in prison.''' ,'''Our courts' decisions do not permeate the public consciousness - we have no equivalent of the Brown v Board of Education ruling which outlawed racial segregation, or of Roe v Wade, which enshrined a woman's right to choose not just into law but into the public imagination as well.''' ,'''A scam is a scam. A fraud is a fraud. Different rules don't apply in the City than they do for you and me.''' ,'''Allowing young people to vote for the first time while they are still at school would allow them to engage with the political process, as well as the relevant issues, with the support of teachers to help them make informed choices.''' ,'''Food banks have become such a powerful symbol in part because they're inescapable.''' ,'''This sounds ridiculous, but my political inspiration is not Marx or Engels or ­anything like that. It was my mum.''' ,'''When you've made a mistake, you have to admit you've made a mistake, and correct it.''' ,'''I think there are many people on £70,000 who may well feel that their circumstances are such that they are not rich.''' ,'''Carving out our own role, distinct from America's, might not be easy. But we must ask ourselves: what alternative is there? Unthinking, uncritical loyalty to the U.S. under Donald Trump is a far less appealing idea.''' ,'''It is clear that too many bankers think that laws are for the little people.''' ,'''The 'Welfare Reform and Work' Bill does nothing to address low wages, or underemployment, and I haven't even got started on how it undermines the provision of affordable housing.''' ,'''As I'm sure everyone would agree, carers who do the difficult job of looking after the elderly and vulnerable deserve to be paid a decent wage that they can actually live on.''' ,'''Putting roadblocks in the way of legitimate strike action only increases the likelihood of more wildcat strikes, which in turn will make it that much harder for employers to address legitimate grievances, given that they'll lose the ability to negotiate with recognised union leaders.''' ,'''The U.K.'s reputation as a business destination will suffer if its authorities cannot be relied on to enforce the law.''' ,'''If you've just been sacked from work, with no money coming in and a baby to feed, clothe and keep warm, it's unlikely you'll have a thousand pounds or so to spare.''' ,'''People like to think about MPs in very crass terms: you're either an uber-loyalist babe, or you're a rebel. There isn't any grown-up room to be thoughtful. There isn't space in public debate for that.''' ,'''We got evicted from our house in Guildford. We were chucked out and had nowhere to go. We ended up in social housing. And it was very hard for my mum. My brothers were five and three.''' ,'''When I first started campaigning to become an MP in 2004, we were suffering as a party because our hierarchy and leadership were totally detached from the party's membership.''' ,'''We should waive fees for those taking equal pay claims; they are our whistleblowers and should be encouraged.''' ,'''You have to be very poor and desperate, or very rich, or lucky, to live in Islington. We don't have the people in the middle, the people who serve the community.''' ,'''The most prominent - and by far the most controversial - part of 'Help to Work' essentially forces people to take unpaid work placements as a condition of receiving their benefits.''' ,'''You can take the girl out of the estate, but you can't take the estate out of the girl.''' ,'''Low pay is a serious problem, and its victims need a genuine solution.''' ,'''For centuries, the courts took the view that preserving the discretion of the authorities trumped the rights of victims to hold them to account. It was because of the Human Rights Act that this began to change.''' ,'''The Human Rights Act has not just given a voice to victims, but to the families who have to fight for the victim where the victim has died.''' ,'''It's often been said that politics in Islington, in many ways, begins and ends with housing, and it's not hard to see why. Despite the borough's image of exclusivity - the stereotype that it's all Georgian squares and cappuccino bars - the reality is much more complex.''' ,'''By creating a perception that the U.K. places a higher premium on striking commercial deals than it does on promoting and protecting human rights, our reputation in the world suffers.''' ,'''The welfare state, which grew out of post-war solidarity, has for decades been based on the principle that those who pay into the system are entitled to expect that the safety net will be there for them when they fall on hard times.''' ,'''The Tories have long since abdicated any pretension of principled global leadership.''' ,'''Taxpayers' and 'people on benefits' are not two separate and distinct groups of people.''' ,'''I've been in politics a long time and the only way you survive is by getting the hide of a rhino.''' ,'''So how helpful has 'Help to Work' actually been? Not very.''' ,'''The fact of the matter is that when governments fail - as the Tories have done - to tackle the root causes of working peoples' need for welfare support, like low pay and high rents, the number of working people relying on benefits increases.''' ,'''When the Tories came to power in 2010, the ground-breaking Equality Act had just become law. But the newly appointed Equalities Minister wasted no time in systematically undermining both the Act itself and the Commission responsible for enforcing it.''' ,'''There was a time when a certain type of Tory could have been relied on to swing from the chandeliers in defence of the rights of freeborn Britons. I suppose a lot of those Tories would have been what you might call 'one-nation Tories.' That tradition has died in the Conservative party.''' ,'''Mum was on benefits for a few years. Then I failed the 11-plus and I went to the secondary modern. And that was hard because the expectations were so low in the school.''' ,'''When upmarket shops like Waitrose collect contributions for local food banks, they serve as a constant reminder to those of my constituents who are lucky enough not to have to worry about where their next meal will come from that those less fortunate than themselves are increasing in number, and suffering more than ever.''' ,'''What a nightmare it would be if we individually had to criminalise every single abuse of every single commodity, market or financial product. There are thousands of these and new ones being invented every day. Such an approach would have disastrous implications for regulation and policy-making. Any slide towards it must be resisted.''' ,'''Even though I've had the odd terse word to say about Donald Trump, I still get invited to events at the U.S. embassy. I always attend, because as long as they're prepared to hear the opposite viewpoint, then I'll never miss that chance when I can.''' ,'''It's unfortunate that the U.K. and Europe don't have the kind of culture which esteems legal protections enforced by the courts in the same way as, for example, the U.S. does.''' ,'''As the MP for Islington South and Finsbury, I have the privilege of representing one of the most diverse constituencies in the U.K.''' ,'''We have all these strong men in politics - whether it's Brazil, or the Philippines, or Trump, or Putin. They're all big men: it's let's look up to them, don't be afraid, they're looking after things. It's so fundamentally anti-democratic.''' ,'''There's a particularly nasty element when lots of men get together sometimes.''' ,'''If we were to allow the Chris Grayling and his cronies to tear up the Human Rights Act and withdraw from the European Convention on Human Rights from which it is derived, we would set back the cause of victims' rights by decades.''' ,'''We must apply the same standards to countries such as Saudi Arabia, Israel and Egypt that we apply to Iran, Russia and Syria.''' ,'''We need to put human rights, a belief in multilateralism and respect for international law back at the heart of foreign policy.''' ,'''I was born into the Labour party. I was delivering leaflets by the age I could reach the letter box.''' ,'''While scrapping the HRA would severely curtail people's ability to seek legal redress in U.K. courts for violations of their fundamental rights, the Tories' threat to withdraw the U.K. from the ECHR are far more frightening.''' ,'''The financial elite do not need special laws for themselves. This is one nation and there is one criminal law.''' ,'''The Fraud Act 2006 makes it perfectly clear that Libor rigging is prosecutable as a criminal offence.''' ,'''My awakening to the fight for women's votes came when I was 13, and the BBC screened a drama called 'Shoulder to Shoulder' about the suffragettes, with the great Sian Phillips as Emmeline Pankhurst. It made a huge impression on me - not just the history, but because of the debates it triggered at home.''' ,'''By repealing the Child Poverty Act, which forced governments to take real action to tackle child poverty, this government brings a proud chapter of British history to an undignified end. In future the government will measure child poverty not by looking at whether they have any money, but by looking at their so-called 'life chances.'''' ,'''To give him his credit, I never thought I'd say this, but Donald Trump was talking about the importance of investing in jobs and infrastructure and in the economies across the country, not just the main cities, and that's right.''' ,'''Patients who have suffered appalling medical negligence, abused children ignored by social services, mistreated residents of care homes - they have all been given a voice by the Human Rights Act.''' ,'''All the evidence shows that establishing the habit of voting as early as possible is a vital tool in making sure that it's maintained throughout people's lives.''' ,'''The Human Rights Act is not a terrorists' charter. It enables ordinary citizens to seek redress when the government breaches fundamental freedoms enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights such as the right to a fair trial, the right to life and free expression.''' ,'''It took LGBT activists 15 years to defeat section 28, but this is not a movement that's afraid of the long struggle. They know all progress is hard-fought, that discrimination against any individual anywhere is discrimination against all, and that the campaign for true, global equality must therefore be won one issue, case and country at a time.''' ,'''Yeah, it is particularly upsetting to be called, whatever it was, sneery, or a snob, given the background I have.''' ,'''One of the fundamental pillars of international humanitarian law is that proper distinction should be made between military targets and civilians. That is why indiscriminate bombing, let alone the deliberate targeting of residential areas or agricultural infrastructure, is considered a war crime.''' ,'''In passing the National Minimum Wage Act in 1998, the then-Labour Government did more than just establish the legal right to a minimum wage, significant as that was. More importantly, the Act made non-compliance a criminal offence.''' ,'''Why the Tories are happy to subsidise home ownership for middle class graduates and affluent social tenants, but not for widows on low incomes, is simply beyond me.''' ,'''Laws protecting this right - whatever the level of the minimum wage, and whatever the Government chooses to call it - are only as strong as the threat of enforcement is both real and feared.''' ,'''The notion of women being written out of history is as old as the Bible, but it always seems more galling when it is the history of progressive movements - such as the abolitionist campaign in Britain or the fight for African-American civil rights - in which the role of women has been diminished.''' ,'''We need to build on our diplomatic networks, and the unrivalled expertise of our Foreign Office, to project a positive image for Britain as a force for good in the world.''' ,'''People don't seem to be safe inside Pentonville, and now it transpires inmates can escape. That is the final straw. If they don't have control of the place, what is the point of it being there? This was built in 1842 and is totally inappropriate for modern needs.''' ,'''AV does not bring you greater proportionality - and there is a tendency for parties to gang up on one of the major ones to run an 'anyone but' campaign.''' ,'''I was 10 when the Equal Pay Act was passed. It was pretty inspiring stuff.''' ,'''It is my view that our response to the Brexit vote should not have been to turn in on ourselves. At a time of grave constitutional and economic challenge for our country, it was incumbent on us to rise to this threat and ensure that the Labour party should defend the interests of our communities and not allow the Tories a free hand.''' ,'''The Alternative Vote is sectarian and self-serving and it will not improve people's lives.''' ,'''There are some very plain, very simple offences in the Fraud Act 2006 that can be applied to price manipulation. For example, there's fraud by false representation. This is aimed at people who say something misleading to line their pockets or cause financial harm to someone else.''' ,'''I wear the chips that I have on my shoulder with pride.''' ,'''When I was starting out as a barrister in the 1980s, Lord Denning was the most famous judge in the land, and the supposed role model for every lawyer. But not for me.''' ,]
