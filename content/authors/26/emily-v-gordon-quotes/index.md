- Post-divorce, the world can feel harsh and full of jagged edges.
- Being completely independent doesn't make you a strong woman - it's being strong enough to trust yourself in other people's hands that takes guts.
- Marriage will not change your spouse. It will not make him or her more mature, more loyal to you, or better at housework.

- Awkward conversations are painful, but they're way easier than divorce, resentment, and heartbreak.
- The period that directly follows the dissolution of a long term relationship is extremely volatile, with emotions running the gamut from misery to elation to relief to terror.
- Sometimes new spouses don't fully process the commitment they've made until after the deal is done, and then they panic.
- Marriage is not a magical potion that serves to amplify adoration, reduce deep-seated feelings of resentment, erase fears of commitment, or answer questions about whether or not this is the right move. Marriage is a ceremony that cements your current bond to another human being, and while that's a huge thing, that's all it does.
- I am fairly convinced that people plan destination weddings because they would actually like to elope but want to have given you the option to attend.
- I think it's lovely when people are more involved in local politics.

- I grew up in a very small town in North Carolina, weird and pudgy, without too many other kids to play with. I spent a lot of time watching TV. It was my reassurance that the outside world was bigger and more colorful than the one I lived in.
- I definitely think, when you're a teenager, it's more forgiving to talk to strangers and go up to people at a mall or whatever.
- I'd watch shows like 'The Kids in the Hall' or 'Twin Peaks,' and I'd see weird people being celebrated and appreciated without compromising their weirdness. On 'The Facts of Life,' I'd see girls who were pudgy, beautiful, popular, tomboyish - many ways of being female - and I'd feel quietly reassured.
- In high school, I decided that all of my female friends were stupid and traded them for guy friends. I loved horror movies and heavy metal and used these interests to become a 'guys' girl.'
- Often, when cheating happens, we rush to place blame solely on one person - either the person who did the cheating, or more insidiously, if it happened to us, we blame ourselves for not being 'good enough' to keep them around. But putting it all on one person doesn't paint the entire picture.

- Ghosts of Marriages Past can haunt many aspects of a new relationship - your expectations of what a man should do, how you behave in conflict, your ideas of how commitment should look - they can even make your new man look untrustworthy when he's really behaving normally.
- If a show is wickedly, hugely popular, like 'Mad Men,' I assume that the masses, in their infinite inferiority to me, don't know what good TV is and that everyone is just brainwashed.
- As any daytime judge show can tell you, spending someone's money or taking their stuff because they hurt your feelings is not justified.
- People get married for a wide array of reasons and have all sorts of expectations of how marriage will change the relationship. And while it's true that turning the person you're dating into a legal partner does affect certain things, those who expect marriage to be a cure-all for all your relationship woes are sorely mistaken.
- Without knowing your own history, you are doomed to repeat it.
- Don't sacrifice alone time with your spouse just because the kids seem needy. A united front requires adult time alone, so put it in the calendar and make it a priority. A house cannot stand on a shaky foundation.
- Do remember to pick your battles when you start parenting your stepchildren.

- No matter how you handle alcohol at your wedding, you will most likely be upsetting someone.
- Sacrificing your relationship for your career sounds noble and romantic from the outside, but the reality is that it can create a pattern of self-destruction that will ultimately burn you out on the career you've worked so hard to build. It's a trap and, for some, an easy way out of having to maintain relationships under stress.
- Hindsight is always 20/20, but I imagine a lot of married and divorced people have insights to share about how they felt during their engagement.
- For so long, TV consisted of a limited number of shows a year, and those shows had to appeal to as many people as possible. The joy of TV now is that shows don't have to be broad anymore - they can be small, weird, and niche.
- A lot of people end up getting married more out of expectation than out of passion for each other, but if your options have ever been, 'We either get married or break up,' be careful. Marriage should be a new addition you add to the house that is your relationship, not the structure you impose on the house once it's already built.
- Marriage isn't just about two people who fit together well. It's about two people who figure out how to fit together well.
- It's absolutely amazing to me that anyone allowed their children to watch 'The Ren & Stimpy Show' in the '90s; it's dark, gross, nihilistic, and absolutely bizarre.

- When we each focus on being the dominant force in our own universe rather than invading other universes, we all win.
- I don't remember being put into the coma, but I do have a lot of weird memories from being under. This may be because I was in a coma via medicine rather than trauma. That time period played out for me as one long rambling dream where I was at a hospital to visit my boyfriend, who I thought was in an accident.

- Marriage, or any committed partnership, has become sacred to me, powerful and fragile all at the same time.
- Nothing makes me feel more mushy and full of love for my husband than going back and looking at our flirtation unfolding online. I love reading our old e-mails, texts, and Gchats.
- Keeping physical items from the past is important - we keep old toys, grandparents' jewelry, yearbooks, dance recital programs - and we assign meaning to them. Those items become the memories, and that's a very healthy thing to do. The problems occur when we have too many of those sentimental items, and they start weighing us down.
- Sometimes we are much better at judging people based on how they treat everyone other than ourselves. We make a million excuses for why they treat us how they do.

- In some cases, newlyweds want so badly for things to be perfect that they ignore warning signs, both in themselves and each other.
- In my experience as a therapist and as a friend, it seems that the majority of the breakup resources available are for women and not men. Women, who tend to be more vocal about their emotional struggles, are the squeaky wheel that gets the grease from friends, from online communities, from books, and from therapeutic approaches.
- When someone insists that you watch a show that's already been on for a few seasons, they're basically saying, 'Hey, you're not doing anything for the next five weeks, are you? Because have I got a plan for you every single night! It's 'Weeds!''
- Betrayal can be extremely painful, but it's up to you how much that pain damages you permanently.

- If a show is a critical success but a ratings flop, I assume that people are just championing the show because it looks cool to root for an underdog.

- Don't expect yourself to immediately love your stepchildren. In fact, you may hate them for a bit.

- After my divorce, I took some time off from having a romantic life to begin the tough work of figuring out where I'd gone wrong and what on Earth I could do to understand how to be a whole person in a relationship.

- I remember being a teenager and feeling like I could talk to anyone anywhere about anything.
