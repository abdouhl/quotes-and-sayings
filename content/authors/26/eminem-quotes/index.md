- Hip hop has always been braggin' and boasting and 'I'm better at you than this' and 'I'm better at you than that.'
- Well, I'm working all the time to stay out of trouble!
- I say what I want to say and do what I want to do. There's no in between. People will either love you for it or hate you for it.
- A lot of the problems I had with fame I was bringing on myself. A lot of self-loathing, a lot of woe-is-me. Now I'm learning to see the positive side of things, instead of, like, 'I can't go to Kmart. I can't take my kids to the haunted house.'
- As for my stuff, I'm just doing guest verses for other people's records. I try to stay recording, because if I don't, I get rusty.
- There was certainly, like, a rebellious, like, youthful rage in me. And there was also the fact of no getting away from fact that I am white, and you know, this is predominantly black music, you know.
- To the people I forgot, you weren't on my mind for some reason and you probably don't deserve any thanks anyway.
- The writing process, the way I go about it is I do whatever the beat feels like, whatever the beat is telling me to do. Usually when the beat comes on, I think of a hook or the subject I want to rap about almost instantly. Within four, eight bars of it playing I'm just like, 'Oh, OK. This is what I wanna do'.

- Anything I've ever said, I certainly was feeling at the time.

- I stopped watching TV because of 'The Wire.' Like, 'The Wire' ruined everything for me because I don't even want to watch anything else now.
- I do say things that I think will shock people. But I don't do things to shock people. I'm not trying to be the next Tupac, but I don't know how long I'm going to be on this planet. So while I'm here, I might as well make the most of it.
- Rap was my drug.
- I'm not really book-smart.
- I am who I am and I say what I think. I'm not putting a face on for the record.
- You're not going to say anything about me that I'm not going to say about myself. There's so many things that I think about myself; if someone really wanted to get at me, they could say this and this and this. So I'm going to say it before they can. It's the best policy for me.
- I was poor white trash, no glitter, no glamour, but I'm not ashamed of anything.
- Why is it so hard for people to believe that white people are poor?! I wouldn't say I lived in a ghetto; I'd say I lived in the 'hood. The same friends I had back then are the same people on tour with me now.
- I am whatever you say I am; if I wasn't, then why would you say I am.
- I always felt that if I was going to do a movie, I wanted it to be authentic.

- I have a slight bit of OCD, I think. I'm not walking around flipping light switches. But when I say I'm going to do something, I have to do it.
- Nobody likes to fail. I want to succeed in everything I do, which isn't much. But the things that I'm really passionate about, if I fail at those, if I'm not successful, what do I have?
- I don't even know how to speak up for myself, because I don't really have a father who would give me the confidence or advice.
- Hip-hop is ever changing but you'll always have the pack. And you'll always have those people who are separated from the pack.
- It sometimes feels like a strange movie, you know, it's all so weird that sometimes I wonder if it is really happening.
- It'd be stupid for me to sit here and say that there aren't kids who look up to me, but my responsibility is not to them. I'm not a baby sitter.

- I'm very much a creature of habit.
- I always say this about my music, and music in general: Music is like a time capsule. Each album reflects what I'm going through or what's going on in my life at that moment.

- Personally, I just think rap music is the best thing out there, period. If you look at my deck in my car radio, you're always going to find a hip-hop tape; that's all I buy, that's all I live, that's all I listen to, that's all I love.
- I realized, 'Yo, I can't do anything in moderation. I don't know how.'

- Yeah, I did see where the people dissing me were coming from. But, it's like, anything that happened in the past between black and white, I can't really speak on it, because I wasn't there. I don't feel like me being born the color I am makes me any less of a person.
- I don't even know how to speak up for myself, because I don't really have a father who would give me the confidence or advice. And if you're always the new kid, you never get a chance to adapt, so your confidence is just zilch.
- My thing is this; if I'm sick enough to think it, then I'm sick enough to say it.

- My only scheme was to be a rapper.
- I need to keep working on myself for a while.

- The album requires a certain focus of mine that I can't really explain - let's just say it's all I can really do while I'm doing it.
- Before I was famous, when I was just working in Gilbert's Lodge, everything was moving in slow motion.
- You know, fame is a funny thing, man, especially, you know, actors, musicians, rappers, rock singers, it's kind of a lifestyle and it's easy to get caught up in it - you go to bars, you go to clubs, everyone's doing a certain thing... It's tough.
- A lot of truth is said in jest.
- Certainly I'm not going to sit on the Internet all day and read what Sam from Iowa is saying about me. But I'm a sponge. I've always been a sponge.
- I'd go to, like, six different schools in one year. We were on welfare, and my mom never ever worked.
- I was going to McDonald's and Taco Bell every day. The kids behind the counter knew me - it wouldn't even faze them. Or I'd sit up at Denny's or Big Boy and just eat by myself. It was sad. I got so heavy that people started to not recognize me.

- The details surrounding both my marriage and subsequent filing for divorce are private, and I had hoped to keep them that way for the sake of my family.
- Being a student of hip-hop in general, you take technical aspects from places. You may take a rhyme pattern or flow from Big Daddy Kane or Kool G Rap.

- I don't hate women - they just sometimes make me mad.
- I didn't have nothin' going for me... school, home... until I found something I loved, which was music, and that changed everything.
- Say there's a white kid who lives in a nice home, goes to an all-white school, and is pretty much having everything handed to him on a platter - for him to pick up a rap tape is incredible to me, because what that's saying is that he's living a fantasy life of rebellion.
- Honestly, I never really put the mic down.
- My overall look on things is a lot more mature than it used to be.

- People can try to reinvent themselves. I don't think you can really change who you are, though, because who you are is pretty much where you came from and what you've done up to now.
- When 'Paul's Boutique' came out, I was one of the fans that didn't get it.
