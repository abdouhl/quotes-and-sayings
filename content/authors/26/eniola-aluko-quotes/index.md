- People have been very quick to judge young black players on their lifestyles and then when they go on to win the World Cup, to take league titles or score goals they're all of a sudden changed men. They haven't changed, people are just choosing to see them in a different way.
- When I score I go wild. Sometimes I put my arms out wide like the way Didier Drogba celebrates for Chelsea or sometimes I try to slide on the grass if the grass is wet enough.
- If, say, a striker knows that scoring 30 goals in a season will lead to them winning a prestigious award then they will try that little bit harder because, regardless of what players may say, individual recognition on the world stage is important.

- I feel that sometimes managers think that, if they can come up with a tactic that leads to success in a major game, they can get all the plaudits.
- I take the sporting genes from my dad.
- The big players historically hold a lot of influence at Chelsea and while I would never doubt their attempts to win matches for the club, their levels undoubtedly change depending on how they feel about a manager at the time. They're either having him or they're not, and once they're not it spells borrowed time for the guy in charge.
- Just because someone doesn't have a silver spoon in their mouth doesn't mean they can't be highly intelligent.

- Standing up for what you believe in and being honest, telling the truth are all very liberating things.
- It's important for a player to leave on the right note. Even if you're not happy to be going, or your relationships at your old club have turned sour, it is always best to be respectful. Thank the club and its fans for their support and the opportunity they gave you and leave with head held high.
- I've been at Chelsea five years and been the butt of many jokes. And I give it back sometimes. That is the beauty of team spirit in a healthy dressing room. I'm not a sensitive, precious person.

- An opportunity to play for your country is never senseless and especially when the games are competitive.

- I always try to talk to my younger teammates in the same way I would do with my older ones and you can see in their eyes how much showing them some respect means.
- My father was a politician. My grandfather was a politician too, maybe it's an innate idea of representing people that we have in our family. I won't go into politics. I think I can provide the voice for the voiceless through law.

- I've experienced it with Chelsea Women: it can be very hard at the top for long periods of time, fighting just to stay in the same position and to preserve an unbeaten run that will always come to an end.

- As a quick, tricky player, I've been told that I don't go down enough because I've always tried to stay on my feet or I don't win clever fouls around the box. But when you are quick, the fastest way to be stopped is by being fouled so it happens to me a lot, even if I don't always maximise the opportunity.
- Don't read, click links or subscribe to any media organisations that peddle sinister untruths and stereotypes.
- As I can testify, living in a foreign country takes you way out of your comfort zone. It's the little things, like ordering food in a different language, buying petrol or learning to drive on the other side of the road, but they all add up to making you a more rounded, educated person.

- The fear for English players has always been that you might risk a place in the national team if you go abroad but now with all the technology we have, and social media, you are able to watch goals and assists every week, which means his performances are just as noticeable as anyone's in the Premier League.

- All over the world people know Juventus as a club affiliated with legends and success and the project with the women's side is very ambitious.
- If young players are capable of playing 90 minutes every week at European clubs why prevent them from doing that?
- Something about the WSL is that the margins for error are very small. In the Premier League you can get away with losing a couple of games, but the women's league is so short and the leaders tend to set the bar so high that if you lose a couple of games your title hopes are over.

- From a young age in England I felt technical skills were coached out of me. I remember when I was 15 doing a rainbow flick over a player's head in training and the coach telling me off and shouting: 'This is not the Eni show.' That discouraged me from expressing myself individually with the ball in that team again.

- It can be difficult for players who are perceived to have turned their backs on England, as Wilfried Zaha has found out after deciding to play for Ivory Coast.
- Look, the reality is that people will pay more for a match when Wayne Rooney is playing than when I am playing. I will never expect to be paid the same as Wayne Rooney, because I am not Wayne Rooney. And there's no getting around that.

Contracts can include a buyback clause such as Barcelona had with Cesc Fabregas, or a sell-on clause where the development club benefit financially from all the work invested in the young player.

- I think public criticism of players can go one of two ways: either the players will want to raise a proverbial middle finger at their manager and prove them wrong, or the squad will go within themselves and performances will deteriorate.
- My first experience playing for England was very scary and nerve wracking.
