- I think modelling helped me. I was very shy and self-conscious when I went to college, and I think in some ways modelling exacerbates those things - because it's all about you being the centre of attention - but it also helped me travel.
- Every part of it is important; the film comes alive when you edit it, the film comes alive when you write it, the film comes alive when you act it, and the same with the directing. They're all the most important part at the time and that's why I enjoy doing it, because you're creating a story and every part is a very integral part of it.
- In a modelling shoot you are trying to play a character, a role. There are models who are dead, who have no expression whatever. I think you need to use your physicality, your sense of humour and your emotion when you model.
- Merlin' was awesome, but the costumes would drive you insane. Every day, you'd get into chain mail and wear 30 pounds of that stuff.
- And then modelling, because it pays you really well and you get to travel, I was forced to get used to the idea of standing in front of a camera and having six or seven people watching me and that actually allowed me to loosen up from an acting point of view.
- I stumbled into acting. My dad, James, was a barrister but he was always very creative and he loved theatre and the arts.
- With acting, you have to put in the groundwork, then maybe you'll get lucky. It's a slog but it's also fun.
- I'd never properly done pilot season in America. I did it for just a couple of weeks, a couple of years ago. Usually, you get pilot scripts and the initial script quality isn't there.
- I don't think I ever really thought I was good-looking.
- And even when I was 18, 19, 20 in college, I did a couple of plays in the drama society, I didn't want to play the lead, I just wanted two lines, and I didn't want to be there because I didn't like it.
- All I've wanted to do is write. In school I just wanted to be a writer but I was afraid to be a writer because I felt I couldn't. It didn't really feel like my writing was interesting enough, so getting a book published was a huge kick.
- A lot of fashion photographers are telling a story with their pictures.
- Because if someone writes something and they have decided this is what it is, it's my job to make it work unless it's way out of left field.
- I love acting, but I hate being in front of camera - I get really awkward. I hate being the centre of attention.
- The fun of that sci-fi and adventure stuff is that it's always somebody who's not believed and is not being trusted. If you saw an alien walk across the street, who are you gonna tell? Who would believe you?
- I learnt how acting is more about listening to the other person; it is about reaction. You learn to be a foil, and that helped when it came to directing.
- When you're in college, you meet somebody that you think is a little bit arrogant and cocky, and you don't like them because they have this attitude about them that seems grating, and then you realize that they have their issues and this whole other side going on.
- When you watch 'Alien' you feel that they are touching stuff as opposed to 'Star Trek', where they're clearly not.
- When I was a kid, growing up, I used to write a lot of stories.
- I was just fascinated with the brain and the mind, and I found psychology engaging for writing about people, and that fed into my interest in cinema.
- If you could do 'Mario Kart' as a really cool film I'd do that.
- I used to read a lot of Isaac Asimov and Philip Dick and 'Inland Empire's' one of the earlier books I read!
- I love science fiction just because of the scope of what it can be.
- Because I don't understand what would be someone's motives to want to go into space, where you're possibly going to die, and to try to meet an entity that may or may not be benevolent or want to kill you.
- When you write a book, people legitimise it by actually reading the book and so it's almost okay to write another one.
- I love the idea of playing a character, to get that chance to be somebody completely different.
- I love Sci-Fi. It's pretty much all I watch.
- My novel, 'Kingdom of Scars', is a coming-of-age story.
- I love auditioning on tape because you have the time and the freedom to work on it, a little bit. A lot of film is slightly dependent on what your composition is and what your lighting is.
- Youth is one of the most visceral times that I remember.
- I think it's much harder to make dramatic films, and much harder to create a film that's engaging, where you're actually properly looking at real characters and subtleties.
- When I left college at 22, I went to LA to study acting after being introduced to an acting coach called Vincent Chase. Later, I got an agent over there.
- I go through periods where I feel very confident about stuff but other periods that are insecure... I find doing different stuff removes the responsibility of focussing on one thing.
- You never know with a new show. It takes awhile for shows to find their feet and for people to connect with it.
