- Major labels don't want to take chances on cooler, indie kind of things. People only know, unfortunately, what they're being spoon-fed.
- I love what I do, and if I'm playing for people who love what I'm doing, I don't really care, I'll keep playing till the cows come home.
- My whole goal in this industry nowadays is to keep doing the underground stuff, but to be able to add vocals that are sexy and underground.
- I've always been about the party and about the vibe. When I connect, I don't care if there are two people in front of me or 70,000. If they're going crazy, I'm going crazy.
- When computers came online and people found out people weren't mixing there was uproar, and outed. But now that hasn't happened. People don't seem to care.
- I feel that in the underground world, there's not enough vocals out there.
- Wherever it is, as long as I have a room full of people ready to have a good time, I will take them there and I will keep them up late.
- Lenny Kravitz is someone I wanna work with. But Prince for sure. He's someone I've loved ever since I was in High School.
- Louie Vega was a huge influence on me.
- This year, I had some downtime before my Australia tour and spent a week or so in Phuket, Thailand. As a confessed workaholic, sometimes it's good to unplug and detach and honestly, the scenery, the weather and the people truly made this an incredible place for me to recharge.
- When looking for new talent, I always look for artists who have something unique about them or are clearly on a mission.
- The DJs with a lot of hype are not necessarily the best DJs at creating a vibe.
- I love coming out to Australia, if it weren't so far away I would go all the time. I've worked with a lot of people down there so I love Australia, I have a lot of great relationships down there... it's such a great vibe.
- For quite some time, I lost my way, not only business-wise but personally.
- Master your craft, be nice and stay humble.
