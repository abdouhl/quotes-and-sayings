The younger generation is more comfortable saying something through a digital mechanism than even face to face.''' ,'''The power of social media is it forces necessary change.''' ,'''As social media is less about technology and more about relationship building, we are starting to see more women have a heavy influence if not dominant role in the social media space. It's no wonder that Facebook is being run in part by chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg.''' ,'''You can spend your time daydreaming or make use of it in other ways.''' ,'''Increasingly, consumers don't search for products and services.

But you also had the counter-culture, the Bay Area. That entire brew came together in Steve Jobs.''' ,'''Everybody's got the mindset that everything should be measurable.''' ,'''That's the power behind a tool like Facebook Connect. It is making a Web without walls. Facebook allows you to go to other sites to comment, rate, etc., without having to set up a new profile for that site.''' ,'''Language is always evolving. It's difficult to read Shakespeare now because language has shifted. Similarly, kids these days can get to the point really quick in about 140 characters or less because of these new tools.''' ,'''With the growing reliance on social media, we no longer search for news, or the products and services we wish to buy. Instead they are being pushed to us by friends, acquaintances and business colleagues.''' ,'''Folks want to be listened to, they want to be heard.''' ,]
