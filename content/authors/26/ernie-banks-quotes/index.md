- During my time, there might have been one pitcher or two that were top pitchers on a team. Teams that won maybe had three, but today they have a lot of depth. They have a lot of long relievers, short relievers, and the strategy is different.
- Did you hear that? I didn't hear anything. Put that question another way.
- It's a great day for a ball game; let's play two!
- I learned from Mr. Wrigley, early in my career, that loyalty wins and it creates friendships. I saw it work for him in his business.

- I own stock, and I also insure my car with Geico.
- I don't think it's up to black athletes to get involved in political or racial issues.
- I guess my critics say, 'He must be crazy. Nothing can be that beautiful.' But when you think that there are so many people around the world who have nothing, you realize how lucky you are to be making a living in the big leagues.

- Some people feel that because you are black you will never be treated fairly, and that you should voice your opinions, be militant about them. I don't feel this way. You can't convince a fool against his will.
- But it all comes down to friendship, treating people right.
- I hit a home run in my first game, and they told me to go into the stands and pass my cap around. I made six dollars in nickels, dimes, and quarters.
- I like my players to be married and in debt. That's the way you motivate them.
- It would be a lot different for me because there is a lot of information that you need to know about as a player. How pitchers are pitching you, how defenses are playing, certain situations about certain pitchers.
- You must try to generate happiness within yourself. If you aren't happy in one place, chances are you won't be happy anyplace.
- The Cubs are due in sixty-two.
- We lived near a supermarket, and whatever they threw away, we would get it, and my mother would make soup. Or she would get a big can of lard, a big can of meal, a big can of flour, a big can of beans, and fix the same meal for months.
- Awards mean a lot, but they don't say it all. The people in baseball mean more to me than statistics.

- I wanted to finish my career with one team, in one city, one mayor, one park, one owner. I did that. The Wrigleys owned the team. We played all of our home games at Wrigley Field during the daytime. So my career was very unique, and I am proud of it.

- The riches of the game are in the thrills, not the money.
- When I wake up in the morning, I feel like a billionaire without paying taxes.
- My theme is, 'The spirit of friendship is the balance of life.' Not money. Not the World Series. It's friendship. The relationships I have with people, that's enough to keep me happy.
