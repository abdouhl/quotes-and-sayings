Its temperature varies. It may receive an ink stain. One of its legs may be broken. It may be repaired, polished, and replaced part by part.

No other scientific ideal can be realised, and any other must be meaningless.''' ,'''Thing, body, matter, are nothing apart from the combinations of the elements, - the colours, sounds, and so forth - nothing apart from their so-called attributes.''' ,'''Many an article that I myself penned twenty years ago impresses me now as something quite foreign to myself.''' ,'''The plain man is familiar with blindness and deafness, and knows from his everyday experience that the look of things is influenced by his senses; but it never occurs to him to regard the whole world as the creation of his senses.''' ,'''Personally, people know themselves very poorly.''' ,'''The ego is as little absolutely permanent as are bodies.''' ,'''A colour is a physical object as soon as we consider its dependence, for instance, upon its luminous source, upon other colours, upon temperatures, upon spaces, and so forth.''' ,'''The presentations and conceptions of the average man of the world are formed and dominated, not by the full and pure desire for knowledge as an end in itself, but by the struggle to adapt himself favourably to the conditions of life.''' ,]
