quotes = ['''It's fine to have social media that connects us with old friends, but we need tools that help us discover new people as well.''' ,'''Sometimes you need the things you didn't know you needed to know.''' ,'''I study the ways new media shapes people's perceptions of the world.''' ,'''People generally pay attention to what they already know about and what they care about.''' ,'''The term 'cyberutopian' tends to be used only in the context of critique. Calling someone a cyberutopian implies that he or she has an unrealistic and naively overinflated sense of what technology makes possible and an insufficient understanding of the forces that govern societies.''' ,'''For countries such as Kenya to emerge as economic powerhouses, they need better infrastructure: roads, ports, smart grids and power plants. Infrastructure is expensive, and takes a long time to build. In the meantime, hackers are building 'grassroots infrastructure,' using the mobile-phone system to build solutions that are ready for market.''' ,'''Reddit, which calls itself 'The Front Page of the Internet,' is more influential in shaping Internet culture than its comparatively small reach would lead you to believe.''' ,'''The uptake on mobile phones in Africa is phenomenal.''' ,'''When you look at the 'New York Times,' you look at other elite media, what you largely get are pictures of very wealthy nations and the nations we've invaded.''' ,'''Increasingly, I'm inspired by entrepreneurs who run nonprofit organizations that fund themselves, or for-profit organizations that achieve social missions while turning a profit.''' ,'''Teenagers try to hide what's really going on in their communication online.''' ,'''There's no locality on the web - every market is a global market.''' ,'''Moments of crisis, like the shooting in Newtown, tend to produce brief spikes of popular interest in gun control. My research on media attention suggests these spikes are extremely short-lived, and that they may be decreasing in intensity.''' ,'''Engineering serendipity is this idea that we can help people come across unexpected but helpful connections at a better than random rate. And in some ways it's based on trying to reassess this notion of serendipitous as lucky - to think of serendipitous as smart.''' ,'''The Internet has become a bunch of interlinked but linguistically distinct and culturally specific spaces. There's some interface between them, but there's a lot less than there was years back when we were sort of pretending that this was one great global space.''' ,'''A common language is a first step towards communication across cultural boundaries.''' ,'''Wikipedia is a victory of process over substance.''' ,'''On Twitter, if you want to quote someone else, you say, 'RT, re-tweet, that person's name, and then what they said before.' And it's a way of essentially saying, 'I'm not saying this, but my friend said this and I thought this was interesting.'''' ,'''When I was growing up in the U.S. in the 1970s, 35-40% of an average nightly newscast focused on international stories.''' ,'''It's my fond hope that social networks such as Facebook will help users broaden their perspectives by listening to a different set of people than they encounter in their daily life. But I fear services such as Facebook may be turning us into imaginary cosmopolitans.''' ,'''You can make the case that slacktivism is important because it makes people feel affiliated to a movement and be part of it, and talk about it.''' ,'''People want to be thought of as something other than a source of money. They want to be thought of as creative, thinking people.''' ,'''Talking about 'stopping globalization' is unrealistic - and probably not what anti-globalization protesters actually want.''' ,'''It's become relatively commonplace to find corners of Africa that have good cell coverage but no electrical power.''' ,'''If we need simple narratives so people can amplify and spread them, are we forced to engage only with the simplest of problems?''' ,'''Curators are great, but they're inherently biased. Curators are always making an editorial decision. Those biases have really big implications.''' ,'''Reading the text of my blog itself is not really the interesting part. The exciting part is how the Internet allows me to be the eyes and ears for the people sending me postings from Africa.''' ,'''The Internet challenges traditional ways of distributing and processing information and so encourages new standards and behavior.''' ,'''Google doesn't really forget.''' ,'''I can imagine Iceland becoming a good place to run a controversial Web site. But... Iceland may find itself forced to defend controversial speech.''' ,'''Re-tweeting is a pretty common practice on Twitter, but on an average day, we see maybe one out of 20 posts is a re-tweet.''' ,'''The U.S. media have done a shameful job of reporting on the Arab world.''' ,'''Now if you're using Twitter or other social networks, and you didn't realize this was a space with a lot of Brazilians in it, you're like most of us. Because what happens on a social network is you interact with the people that you have chosen to interact with.''' ,'''When you sign up for Facebook, the service first searches for any mentions of your name and suggests you befriend anyone who has mentioned you in their posts. It then asks to access your e-mail account so you can connect with anyone with whom you regularly correspond.''' ,'''Creativity is an import-export business.''' ,'''I can read a lot of French newspapers with Google Translate and have them read quite comfortably.''' ,'''On the Internet, information from Indiana and India is equally cheap and easy to access.''' ,'''A world where everyone creates content gets confusing pretty quickly without a good search engine.''' ,'''The wider world is a click away, but whether we mean to or not, we're usually filtering it out.''' ,'''Reddit names are unconnected to real-world identities and it's commonplace for users to create 'throwaway' accounts to reveal sensitive information.''' ,'''The benefits and consequences of globalization have a great deal to do with whether we're intelligent and thoughtful about how we approach globalization, or whether we're blindly accepting... or blindly resistant.''' ,'''The Internet has not become the great leveller that it was once thought it could be.''' ,'''If I use Facebook to stay in touch with my high school friends who are church-going Republicans, I may be getting more ideological diversity than in hanging out with secular progressives on the World Politics sub-reddit.''' ,]
