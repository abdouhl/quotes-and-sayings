- You don't have to take yourself so seriously all the time.
- I got the most surprising reaction was when I had bleached blonde hair with a black stripe at the bottom - all of the ends were black. That one got the most attention - good and bad.
- I am trying to be a good person. I am trying to be myself, and if nobody likes me for me, that is their problem.
- What's nice about acting is that you're not just left with yourself all the time, but you get to see the world through so many different people's eyes.

- Throughout the entire time I was filming 'Thirteen,' I'd just lock myself in my room and listen to Garbage's first album. It was Shirley Manson, Nirvana and Radiohead who got me through everything. Also, Alanis Morissette and Tori Amos. They were so beautiful and strange, and they gave women permission to be angry and emotional, but also strong.
- I always feel like one of the guys and very unintimidated.

- I don't remember a time when I wasn't acting. I have taken time off to figure out if it's what I really want to do, and it is. The only other job I'd want is to be a psychologist, as I spend most of my time analyzing people and emotions.
- Dry shampoo is just really awesome because it'll keep your hair light, but it'll give it texture so that you can move it and style it, but it'll kind of just stay in place - so I really love dry shampoo on shorter hair.
- People who I've worked with are always like, 'Why aren't you doing comedy? You're funny!' because they've only seen the one side. I did do the comedy 'Whatever Works,' with Woody Allen and Larry David.
- I'm constantly changing, I'm constantly growing. I think I'm a little controversial... I just try and keep some mystery, so hopefully people can't really put their finger on it.
- All my life people have made fun of me because I was so skinny. They kind of made me feel bad about it sometimes. I worried that maybe people will think I am really anorexic.
- We all just kinda did everything we thought we were supposed to do and girls dated the guys they were supposed to and did things with the guys they were supposed to.
- The biggest lessons I've learned in life have probably come from a bad situation, from an angry situation, even if I wasn't the one who was angry.

- I have a very large shoebox overflowing with lyrics I've been writing and collecting since my teen years and into my late 20s, with lyrics from all walks of my life. Darkness, being in love, being heartbroken, finding yourself... and lyrics that I've been sitting on for, like, seven years, that I haven't done anything with.

- I do love when men wear cologne - if I get a hint of it, I want to move closer so I can smell it more.
- I am on Facebook, but it's mainly for friends and family, so it's not my real name. But I am on Twitter a lot. I resisted it for so long, but I love it because I get to connect with people I look up to - actors, comedians, and singers.
- I have a karaoke lounge in my house, complete with a tiki bar and hula-girl lamps and disco balls.
- Sometimes I think I still dress like a 13-year-old boy. It's not that I don't like feminine clothing: I just like a blend because it reflects who I am.
- I've made my own music, and the way I've always described it is Peggy Lee with an electric guitar, or Billie Holiday with some PJ Harvey in there.
- I was always into very androgynous things. Guys, girls... I'm into androgyny in general.
- Any child actor will tell you that you don't have a lot of the tools or the experience to combat a lot of the criticism or very adult situations being thrown at you.

- I have facials, and I'll do microdermabrasion every now and then. But mostly, I eat right - you know, lots of greens - and I drink a lot of water. And I like to use a lot of natural stuff on my face. I don't like to over-product it. I actually wipe my makeup off with olive oil.
- I'll never forget my 24th birthday when my tooth got punched out. And for a second I was like, it would be really hilarious if I sold it on eBay. But I can't, that's just too creepy. I don't think I can go there.
- The Beatles mean so much to so many people, you know? Everybody has at least one song of The Beatles that's one of their favorite songs of all time.
- I used to not even be able to order pizza on the phone because I was just so shy. I think that's why so much comes out on-screen: because that's my time to let go in a safe place. When you're doing that, it's all written down on paper, and it's total fiction.
