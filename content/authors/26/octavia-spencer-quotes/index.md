- Do I feel that white directors have to tell only white stories? No. Do I feel that black filmmakers should only tell stories about black people? No. If we say that, then that means Asian people cannot write about anybody but Asians. I don't think a woman should only write about women.
- The hardest thing about writing, for me, is facing the blank page.
- Yes, you want to do studio movies, but I also want to grow as an actor, and an actress like me is not going to get roles where you grow and evolve in a studio film. It's just not gonna happen.

- There are fewer and fewer roles that I haven't done already, or archetypes that I haven't played, and to break out of that box, the most interesting stuff is television.
- If you come out of the gate with a finger pointed, then you really aren't opening the door to any sort of resolution to whatever the problem may be. Whether it's about race or sexual orientation or religion, if you can't empathize with the opposing party, then you can't really meet in the middle.

- Tough love is the hardest to give.

- You have to create your own path and I'm up to the challenge.
- The statement that I made and that I think I will continue to make is that racism and bigotry isn't just relegated to the Southern region; it permeates the history of our nation.

- I think it's actually a misperception that I am a comedic actress. I do more drama than comedy but very little of it has been seen. When you are in big funny movies and they do well and your little part in it kind of explodes people perceive you as a comedian.
- I don't have one role that I want to play. I guess... I want to be a producer. I want to be an activist. I want to be proactive in bringing about work for men, women, boys, girls, everybody who is good at what they do and deserve a shot at it.
- Let me tell you, my career went from zero to 900. Its hard keeping up with that pace, but I wouldn't trade it for anything else in the world.

- I choose projects that resonate with me on some personal level and projects that I'm afraid to do. If I'm afraid to do them, then I usually say yes, because it means that I'm not ready to go there and deal with certain aspects of the script. And that means that I need to do it, because the things that scare you only make you better and stronger.

- I want to be proactive in bringing about change and enlightening people.
- You would not believe that Paula Patton and I have the same trainer.
- You have to get out of your comfort zone in order to grow. And as an actor, you don't become Meryl Streep by doing the same type of comedy. You get there by being challenged. And unfortunately, there's a lack of roles for women of color, so you actually have to be the engineer creating some of those roles.
- I've seen too many sunrises, as far as the walk of shame, staying out too late doing very bad things.

- Civil rights happened because youth got involved. The youth stood up and helped to break the pattern that their parents had got accustomed to living. The next generation has to take that stand for whatever it is, socially, that they are involved in.
- My mom always told me I could do or be anything I dared to dream, and I always wanted to work in the movie industry.
- There are so few roles out there. And even if it is a film that could be led by a black actress, how many times is that film going to get funded? Let's just be real. But it's not just black people. It's Asians, it's Hispanic people if you're not Salma Hayek. It's hard. It's hard to get films funded.
- I'm one of those people if you ask, 'What's your favourite song?' I'm going to give you five. I don't have just one favourite.
- I'll say that I don't think you can throw a stone and not come in contact with someone who knows someone or has problems with substance abuse.
- Being a part of a large family is just like a little society: those who fight to the top of the heap. We relied on each other and still do. They never discouraged me or told me to get a proper job.
- People want to see something that isn't necessarily somebody walking around in a superhero costume.
- I should be married and have 19 kids. And now I'm thinking my eggs are dying on the shelf. They're going to go past their expiration date. But it's what I chose, so I'm fine with that decision.
- You cannot live to please everyone else. You have to edify, educate and fulfill your own dreams and destiny, and hope that whatever your art is that you're putting out there, if it's received, great, I respect you for receiving it. If it's not received, great, I respect you for not.
- I'm excited that I get to do what I love, and I'm benefiting through projects that speak to me.
- I know I'm never going to be one of those size 2 actresses - that's just not me. But I do want to be the healthiest I can be, and a role model to women of all shapes and sizes.
- My hat's off to Shonda Rhimes.
- 'Grey's Anatomy' is a very culturally diverse show.
- As a kid, I was always very thin, and I kind of didn't know that I was skinny.
- What I love about Tadashi is that he isn't a designer that designs only for a double-zero. He designs for double-Ds, you know? Women of all shapes and sizes can wear him.
- The reality is that there are so few roles out there for women and for women of color, and I'm a character actor, this I know. And I'm getting to see more of the roles that are out there, but there aren't many. And zilch have been studio movies. Zilch.
- If you are unhealthy, start by making small changes to become healthier. You are unique, beautiful, and worthy.
- If you tell me I can't eat something, I'll obsess over it and end up overeating!
- It may sound funny, but it's true: I tried to put myself through the 12-step program. I didn't want to attend a real meeting; my role didn't really require that, and I feel those meetings are sort of sacred, and they're anonymous for a reason. I tried to deal with some of my love of snacks - and I relapsed a lot.
- Angry or not. It's a human emotion. But you can't walk around being angry all the time. What a dull person you'd have to be!
- I think the paradigm is shifting with regard to women and what we bring to the industry. I feel very blessed.
- If more women ate, they would be a lot happier. Let me tell you, I am a lot grumpier when I don't eat.
