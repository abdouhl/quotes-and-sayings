- You have two choices with Obama. You either believe that he is a man of Christ... or you think he's a liar. And I'm surprised by the number of atheist free thinkers that support Obama, and their argument is essentially, 'He's lying about being religious 'cause you have to do that to get elected.' It's a horrible reason to like somebody.
- It's only the losers named 'Dave' that think having an unusual name is bad, and who cares what they think? They're named 'Dave.'

Voting for our government to use guns to give money to help poor and suffering people is immoral, self-righteous, bullying laziness.

- My hair is way, way long. I've hitchhiked across the country a zillion times. I've ridden in every car. I was never a hippie. It takes more than long hair.
- Computers absolutely changed my life. Before I had a computer, I had never written one thing. Not one thing. I'm a very bad speller and I was embarrassed by that. When I would type, the little mistakes would make me nutty, and I would never edit anything.
- When I was 15, 16, 17 years old, I spent five hours a day juggling, and I probably spent six hours a day seriously listening to music. And if I were 16 now, I would put that time into playing video games.

- Religion cannot and should not be replaced by atheism. Religion needs to go away and not be replaced by anything. Atheism is not a religion. It's the absence of religion, and that's a wonderful thing.
- Everyone's goals are the same with very small differences. I mean, the goal of a socialist and the goal of a libertarian are exactly the same. The goals are happiness and security and freedom, and you balance those.
- The one kind of person I have a lot of trouble understanding is the kind of person that says the existence of God or religion doesn't matter, it's not an important decision. I think it's vitally important; it's what all our lives are based on.

- One thing you learn doing magic tricks for a living is how close every performance of every magic trick is to disaster. There are no robust magic tricks. They're all hanging from a thread - sometimes literally.

- I think one of the things about Donald Trump that's interesting is he lives in a rarified atmosphere where it's possible that he doesn't get enough feedback, enough people rolling their eyes at him. It's a danger more in show business than it is with wealth.
- When someone is trying to interpret something for you, they always have an agenda.

- I've been fired from a situational comedy with a script they wrote specifically for me because of my voice.
- You should think about the world and feel about your heart.

- Modern American magic, late 20th century magic, is tremendously disrespectful of the audience.
- When 9/11 hit, the second thing I said to myself was, 'This really is what religious people do.' Those people flying the plane were very good, very pious, truly faithful believers. There's no other way to paint them. Of course, they are extremists by definition, but they certainly aren't going against Islam in any real way.
- I don't think I'm made of the right stuff to be a politician. I think I'm made to be a loose cannon.
- Even if I disagree with Obama on many, many things, he is certainly qualified to be president. He is certainly competent to be president.
- I will forever stick up for Catholics and Christians in general. With a small number of very horrible exceptions, they do play by the rules.

- If I had to imagine omniscient, omnipresent, omnipotent power in the universe that chose to make my mother suffer, I don't know how I would make that make sense in the universe.
- There's no job in show business that's harder than any other job outside show business.
- It wasn't success, because Teller and I, by the time Asparagus Valley got together - within a year, we had achieved all our goals. I mean, our goal was to earn our living doing exactly what we wanted. Which is many people's goal.
- Jay-Z, he knows precisely who he's going for - 14-year-old white suburban girls.
- TV networks are dying. The death throes of religion give us jihads. The death throes of television give us reality shows.
- Magic is the Special Olympics of entertainment.
- You can't allow people freedom and then change your mind when the things don't go your way.
- Once you have somebody that is telling you, 'We are interpreting God for you,' it seems like you either agree or you don't. You either say, like Martin Luther, 'I'm going to have a direct relationship with the word of God,' or I'm going to go through a conduit of God on Earth,' which would be the Pope.

- From 1985 to 1994, I lived in Manhattan in a big old loft right off Times Square. I could walk to work, which was in a couple of Broadway theaters, to Howard Stern's studio, and to 30 Rock for 'Letterman' and 'SNL.' Even in New York, walking to work is homey and folksy, like living in a small town.
- I don't believe in vengeance. Really, when all is said and done, I probably don't believe in punishment.
- Bob Saget is the dirtiest comic who's ever lived. Nobody touches him.
- The secret truth of 'Celebrity Apprentice' is that it isn't very hard... 'Celebrity Apprentice' is easy like junior high is easy. All the arithmetic, the creative writing and the history are super simple, but like junior high, you do that easy work surrounded by people who are full-tilt, hormone-raging bug nutty.
- I never wanted to be a magician. I never wanted to be a comedian. I never wanted to be onstage.
- Freedom means the freedom to be stupid, and that's what I want.
- I think it's pretty cruel to give a kid a name that others are going to have. I think it's very important to have a unique name within any group you're likely to be in.

- We knew that we were kind of odd and creeps, and we wanted to do odd, creepy stuff for people who wanted to see that.
- Poker has the feeling of a sport, but you don't have to do push-ups.

- Penn & Teller don't know jack about global warming.
- We celebrities are desperate pigs.
- 'Psycho' is fascinating philosophically, because the point of 'Psycho' is that everything that's bad happens because of love.

- I don't speak for all Libertarians any more than Sean Penn speaks for all Democrats.
- I have a very specific definition of censorship. Censorship must be done by the government or it's not censorship.

- Poker would have never gotten on TV when we only had three networks.
- Mentally ill people come from all belief systems.
- I'm very happy being big and effeminate.
- When I was a kid, politicians wanted to avoid talking about religion if they could. John F. Kennedy couldn't duck the issue, being Catholic and all. So how did he address it? By reminding Americans that religion shouldn't be an issue, that he was concentrating on big things like poverty and hunger and leading the space race.
- Democracy without respect for individual rights sucks. It's just ganging up against the weird kid, and I'm always the weird kid.
- There never was a God. 'God is dead' is a halfway measure I won't go with.
- Everybody wants clean, safe energy. Some people think nuclear is the way to go. Some people think coal is the way to go. Some people think wind is the way to go. And there's always balances on that.
- Teller and I worked Renaissance Festivals and street performing - actually more real, no kidding around, Philadelphia street performing than we did Renaissance Festivals.
- No one can tell you the rules of 'Celebrity Apprentice.' No one. Donald Trump just does what he wants, which is mostly pontificating to people who are sucking up to him, while the network people try to manipulate him into making the highest-rated show they can.
- People still seem to think that they should vote themselves money. They seem to think there is stuff which they think is the government's job, when it's really the individual's job.
- I'm a big fan of huge populations of people, so you'd think with 300 million people in the country, you don't even have to please 1% to be phenomenally successful.
- The vast majority of people who have mental illness problems never hurt anybody.
- The Tea Party claims to want small government.
- If I go out to dinner with you and you order wine, I leave. I won't be around drugs and alcohol at all.
- I will not counter the insanity of the PATRIOT Act with an overblown fear of my rights being taken away.
- There is this tremendous amount of arrogance and hubris, where somebody can look at something for five minutes and dismiss it. Whether you talk about gaming or 20th century classical music, you can't do it in five minutes. You can't listen to 'The Rite of Spring' once and understand what Stravinsky was all about.
- 'Zolten' is a common Hungarian name, it's my wife's maiden name and most importantly, it's the name of Dracula's dog.
- The purpose of art is to collide the intellectual and visceral together at the highest speed possible.
- If you spend a lot of time lying to people, you think a lot about what the truth means.
- I like movies that are scary, but I don't want them to be dirt dumb. I want a movie that gets my blood racing, makes me laugh, but also gives me something to think about, with maybe a little sexy thrown in. Hollywood doesn't make movies like that.
- All David Blaine is is a good-looking magician.
- Penn & Teller stopped doing practical jokes, and the reason is we got much too good at it.
- As much as I disagreed with every second of 'Fahrenheit 9/11,' the fact that it is out made me jump for joy.
- Religion is often just tribalism: pride in a group one was born into, a group that is often believed to have 'God' on its side.
- I'm totally against straight marriage - even though I'm married. I don't think heterosexual marriage is any of the government's business.
- Cars mean nothing to me. I'm not a car guy.
- There is no reason for the government to limit political speech.
