- It is important to me that I was not raised in Los Angeles.
- When I first heard 'A Christmas Story, the musical,' I thought, Oh, that could be really good. It just felt like it fit. Some films lend themselves well to other formats, some don't, but there are so many fantasy sequences in the film, and Ralphie's such a dreamer as a character, I thought they could really lend themselves to being set pieces.
- I've been really lucky in that I've been able to work so much, and pretty much everything I've done has been really great fun.
- It's a difficult world for lots of child actors, and it's difficult to be a teenager under any circumstances. Add to that notoriety and fame, and things can go really wrong. But I had a terrific family and grew up very normal in Phoenix.
- I've had a nontabloid life because I had a really good family.
- People will still recognize me and say, 'You'll shoot your eye out!'
- I had brothers and sisters and did chores and had to pick up the dog crap in the yard and mow the lawn and do all the normal things that kids have to do.
- When you're involved in those big-budget movies, there's a lot of hype: 'Oh this is gonna be a big hit!' And 'A Christmas Story' wasn't. It came and went and was a big disappointment at the box office.
- When you're a child actor and play the precocious kid, the temptation is to wear leather pants or a cutoff shirt to redefine yourself. But I never felt the need to randomly reshuffle the deck and say, 'Don't call me Peter. Call me Pete.' I just figured you evolve naturally, and you'll be recognized for what your successes are.
- I only get involved with projects as a producer if I feel creatively inspired.
- Guys like Alvin Adams, Sweet D Walter Davis, Larry Nance, and Kyle Macy became my basketball heroes.
- When the St. Louis Cardinals arrived in Arizona as the Phoenix Cardinals, I became a fan and still am today.
- You have to pace yourself. As a producer, you start with a concept and shepherd it through the script to the delivery of the film. It's a very long journey for an hour and 40 minutes of movie.
- 'A Christmas Story' has always meant a lot to me personally.
- I guess I've always had a similar-looking face.
- I got to Arizona in 1980, before the Cardinals, Diamondbacks and Coyotes. The sun rose and set with the Phoenix Suns, and it wasn't very spectacular. But I became a loyal fan and went to a lot of games.
- I think you always win in storytelling when you let the best creative ideas guide you.
- An actor can come in with a specific energy and get it on film over several days or weeks, but as the producer, I'm responsible for the overall trajectory of the project.
- I stopped acting a long time ago and my primary career has been producing-directing film.
- A lot of people don't like child actors.
- I was sleeping on editing room floors for $300 a week.
- It's nice to be known for a pretty great movie.
- I think if you turn down the volume on the good comedy, you should not even know if it's a comedy or not. It should look like a drama.
- I think good comedy is a commitment to the absurd in that the situation for the actors should be virtually played like a drama.
- I have already done two Christmas films: 'Elf' and 'Four Christmases.' I guess I really am a sucker for Christmas. Both movies are really about the importance of family. I come from a brood of five kids, and it's the one time of year we can all get together. It's hands-down my favorite holiday.
- It's a rare film that has staying power. 'A Christmas Story' is not just a funny movie but something that connects with people.
- I've always been self-motivated, but I can't take a ton of credit for any success I've had.
- I'm generally not a fan of remaking great films.
- I'm a big watcher of sports, consumer of sports content, so I love documentaries; I love the format.
- Why would you want to remake a movie that has endured for more than 25 years?
- When I was a kid, I really wanted a metal detector for Christmas, convinced I was going to find buried treasure and could retire at 12. Santa Claus brought me one, but sadly, that treasure was never realized. It's amazing how many bottle caps you have to dig up. But to be honest, that dream is still alive.
- You're going to spend a long time with the stuff you work on; you might as well like it.
- 'A Christmas Story' has become such a special part of the holiday season for so many families.
