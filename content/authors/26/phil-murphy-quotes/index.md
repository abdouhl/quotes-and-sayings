- I am a huge believer in organized labor. Period. Full stop.
- We want to say to everyone: New Jersey's a place where gender does not play a role in how much you get paid.
- I think the notion of tax fairness is the reasonable thing to do.
- If you're in Alabama, you're selling tax incentives - with all due respect to Alabama - because what else are you going to sell? In New Jersey, you've got location, public education, highly educated workforce, density, diversity, infrastructure.

- What is the deepest passion for me and for us is the historic investment in the middle class and in - as I say often because I was that guy growing up - the dreams of those who look up who want to get into the middle class. That I feel the strongest about.
- When you buy a company that's been on its butt you raise a lot of money, you instantly put new management in place, but that's the end of the glory for three to five years, grinding it out one day after the other.
- I think you can find a good, happy balance between being a great research university as Rutgers is and being a high-quality sports program.
- Raising the minimum wage does not take from growth, it adds to growth.
- Equal pay for equal work isn't, 'Here, I'll give this to you.' It's confidence, it's participation.
- I can't give up the allegiances I grew up with, given where I was born and where I grew up, but you won't see me at a Rutgers game rooting for somebody else. Let's put it that way.
- I'll go to my grave saying a gimmick is not good public policy.
