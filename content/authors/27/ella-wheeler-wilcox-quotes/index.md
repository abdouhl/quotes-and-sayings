This restless craving in the souls of men spurs them to climb, and to seek the mountain view.''' ,'''Give us that grand word 'woman' once again, and let's have done with 'lady'; one's a term full of fine force, strong, beautiful, and firm, fit for the noblest use of tongue or pen; and one's a word for lackeys.''' ,'''The man who radiates good cheer, who makes life happier wherever he meets it, is always a man of vision and faith.''' ,'''It has ever been since time began, and ever will be, till time lose breath, that love is a mood - no more - to man, and love to a woman is life or death.''' ,'''To sin by silence, when we should protest, Makes cowards out of men.''' ,'''Let there be many windows to your soul, that all the glory of the world may beautify it.''' ,'''One ship drives east and other drives west by the same winds that blow. It's the set of the sails and not the gales that determines the way they go.''' ,''''Tis easy enough to be pleasant, When life flows along like a song; But the man worth while is the one who will smile when everything goes dead wrong.''' ,'''The spark divine dwells in thee: let it grow.''' ,'''For an actress to be a success, she must have the face of Venus, the brains of a Minerva, the grace of Terpsichore, the memory of a Macaulay, the figure of Juno, and the hide of a rhinoceros.''' ,'''Earth is the anteroom of Heaven, if we choose to see it so.''' ,'''All love that has not friendship for its base, is like a mansion built upon the sand.''' ,'''The splendid discontent of God With chaos made the world. And from the discontent of man The worlds best progress springs.''' ,'''There is no chance, no destiny, no fate, that can circumvent or hinder or control the firm resolve of a determined soul.''' ,'''No difficulty can discourage, no obstacle dismay, no trouble dishearten the man who has acquired the art of being alive. Difficulties are but dares of fate, obstacles but hurdles to try his skill, troubles but bitter tonics to give him strength; and he rises higher and looms greater after each encounter with adversity.''' ,'''Love lights more fires than hate extinguishes, and men grow better as the world grows old.''' ,'''And the smile that is worth the praises of earth is the smile that shines through tears.''' ,'''So many gods, so many creeds, so many paths that wind and wind while just the art of being kind is all the sad world needs.''' ,'''With every deed you are sowing a seed, though the harvest you may not see.''' ,'''A pat on the back is only a few vertebrae removed from a kick in the pants, but is miles ahead in results.''' ,'''Always continue the climb. It is possible for you to do whatever you choose, if you first get to know who you are and are willing to work with a power that is greater than ourselves to do it.''' ,]
