- You can ask me anything you like about my work, but I'll never talk about myself.
- I never wrote my books especially for children.
- I think that 'Mary Poppins' needs a subtle reader, in many respects, to grasp all its implications, and I understand that these cannot be translated in terms of the film.
- 'Friend Monkey' is really my favorite of all my books because the Hindu myth on which it is based is my favorite - the myth of the Monkey Lord who loved so much that he created chaos wherever he went.
- You do not chop off a section of your imaginative substance and make a book specifically for children, for - if you are honest - you have no idea where childhood ends and maturity begins. It is all endless and all one.
- A writer is, after all, only half his book. The other half is the reader and from the reader the writer learns.
- My father died when I was 7. I was his favorite child, and he was my beloved father. I brought him along with me all through my life. Every elderly man has a bit of my father in him for me.
- I've had quite a lot to conquer in myself apart from writing. Not that I've been a pure angel when I come to the end of it.
- I was brought up Irish, where there was room for my own private world.
- My family didn't like me going on the stage, and they didn't much like my being a writer, either.
- I think the idea of 'Mary Poppins' has been blowing in and out of me, like a curtain at a window, all my life.
- Every child needs to have for itself not only its loving parents and siblings and friends of its own age, but a grown-up friend.
- Sorrow lies like a heartbeat behind everything I have written.
- For me, there are no answers, only questions, and I am grateful that the questions go on and on. I don't look for an answer because I don't think there is one. I'm very glad to be the bearer of a question.
- I cannot summon up inspiration; I myself am summoned.
- Nothing I had written before 'Mary Poppins' had anything to do with children, and I have always assumed, when I thought about it at all, that she had come out of the same wall of nothingness as the poetry, myth and legend that had absorbed me all my writing life.
