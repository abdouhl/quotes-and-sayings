quotes = ['''I've just come back from Mississippi and over there when you talk about the West Bank they think you mean Arkansas.''' ,'''For Americans of the Greatest Generation that fought World War II and of the Silent Generation that came of age in the 1950s, the great moral and ideological cause was the Cold War. It gave purpose and clarity to our politics and foreign policy, and our lives.''' ,'''Whatever they did for democracy, the U.S. interventions in the Middle East and the vaunted Arab Spring have proved to be pure hell for Arab Christians.''' ,'''Once an entitlement program has been created with millions of beneficiaries, it becomes almost impossible to repeal.''' ,'''While our corporatists burn incense at the shrine of the global economy, Trump went to visit the working-class casualties. And those forgotten Americans in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin responded.''' ,'''What would be the political benefits to Obama of an amnesty? It could weld Hispanics to the Democratic Party, would be wildly popular with the ideological and Christian Left, and quietly welcomed by those Chamber-of-Commerce Republicans who have silently supported amnesty and secretly want immigration off the table in 2016.''' ,'''What vital U.S. interest is imperiled in who comes to power in Podgorica, Montenegro? Why cannot Europe handle this problem in its own back yard?''' ,'''How does the GOP repeal and replace Obamacare without cutting the benefits upon which millions of Americans have come to rely?''' ,'''Bush II's democracy crusade and Obama's embrace of the Arab Spring have unleashed and empowered forces less receptive to America's wishes and will than the despots and dictators deposed with our approval.''' ,'''If the Europeans want to intervene, that's their business. But if I were president, I would remove every United States soldier from the Balkan peninsula.''' ,'''Russia and China, which have embraced autocratic capitalism, have attracted admirers and emulators by the seeming success of their strongman rule.''' ,'''The hour of the liberal interventionists like Hillary Clinton in Libya, like the neocons' hour of power in the GOP, is over.''' ,'''The GOP used to be united on a traditionalist view of social and moral issues.''' ,'''To get Xi Jinping to help with our Pyongyang problem, Trump has dropped all talk of befriending Taiwan, backed off Tillerson's warning to Beijing to vacate its fortified reefs in the South China Sea, and held out promises of major concessions to Beijing in future trade deals.''' ,'''Historically, the Balkans have been an incubator of war.''' ,'''Stop exporting American jobs. Stop exporting American factories, and stop exporting American sovereignty and independence to global institutions like the World Trade Organization.''' ,'''Just as there's garbage that pollutes the Potomac river, there is garbage polluting our culture. We need an Environmental Protection Agency to clean it up.''' ,'''The Republican Party of Richard Nixon was called to power in 1968 to bring an honorable end to the war in Vietnam and restore law and order to campuses and cities convulsed by crime, riots and racial violence. Nixon appeared to have succeeded and was rewarded with a 49-state landslide.''' ,'''What kind of society have we become when children in a great city cannot rely on mothers or fathers for a bowl of cereal in the morning and a brown bag with a sandwich and apple in it for lunch?''' ,'''Lyndon Johnson, his 44-state landslide in 1964 and Great Society notwithstanding, was by 1968 a failed president being repudiated in the primaries of his own party.''' ,'''Why, a quarter of a century after the Cold War, do we still have 28,000 troops in Korea?''' ,'''The American tradition of Washington and Hamilton and Madison and Lincoln and TR and Pat Buchanan is of economic nationalism - making America an independent, self-sufficient, sovereign forever country that's able to stand on its own feet.''' ,'''McCarthy emerged in the person of Senator Russ Feingold of Wisconsin.''' ,'''How does one leave Social Security and Medicare untouched, grow defense by more than $50 billion, slash taxes, launch a $1 trillion infrastructure program - and not explode the deficit and national debt?''' ,'''With homosexual marriage gaining converts among the young, the party of the Moral Majority declines to stand with Chick-fil-A.''' ,'''Anybody that believes that a country can be maintained that has no ethnic core to it or no linguistic core to it, I believe, is naive in the extreme.''' ,'''Secularist justices de-Christianized our country. They invented new rights for vicious criminals as though criminal justice were a game. They tore our country apart with idiotic busing orders to achieve racial balance in public schools.''' ,'''While our bipartisan establishment worships diversity, Trump saw Middle America recoiling from the demographic change brought about by Third World invasions. And he promised to curb them.''' ,'''A U.S. war with Iran could end with a Kurdish enclave in Iran's northwest tied to Iraqi Kurdistan, Iran's Azeri north drifting toward Azerbaijan, and a Balochi enclave in the south linked to Pakistan's largest province, Balochistan, leaving Iran only Persia.''' ,'''He rejects the New World Order established at the Cold War's end by the United States. Putin puts Russia first.''' ,'''When politicians don black robes and seize powers they do not have, they should be called out for what they are - usurpers and petty tyrants.''' ,'''I don't doubt a number of those ballots, of those votes that were cast for me, probably were intended for Vice President Gore.''' ,'''The Bay of Pigs became a metaphor for feckless folly and failure.''' ,'''During the Cold War, the United States took its friends where it found them.

Democratic dissidents like Jawaharlal Nehru in India and Olof Palme in Sweden got the back of our hand.''' ,'''As polarized as we have been, we Americans are locked in a cultural war for the soul of our country.''' ,'''From America's schools, religion has been relentlessly purged.

When did we come to worship this idol?''' ,'''Parents have a right to insist that godless evolution not be taught to their children.''' ,'''Beijing cannot sit by and let her North Korean ally be bombed, nor can it allow U.S. and South Korean forces to defeat the North, bring down the regime, and unite the peninsula, with U.S. and South Korean soldiers sitting on the Yalu, as they did in 1950 before Mao ordered his Chinese army into Korea.''' ,'''If U.S. air, naval, missile, and ground forces were not in and around Korea, and if we were not treaty-bound to fight alongside South Korea, there would be no reason for Kim to build rockets to threaten a distant superpower that could reduce his hermit kingdom to ashes.''' ,'''Russian hacking of the DNC is a problem, not a scandal.''' ,'''Turkey, a powerful and reliable ally of the U.S. through the Cold War, appears to be coming unmoored from Europe and the West and is becoming increasingly sectarian, autocratic, and nationalistic.''' ,'''Putin could no more survive returning Crimea to Ukraine than Bibi Netanyahu could survive giving East Jerusalem back to Jordan.''' ,'''I'm a traditionalist. I'm a Latin mass Catholic, and I hold to traditional views of responsibility.''' ,'''Much of the hostility toward Putin stems from the fact that he not only defies the West when standing up for Russia's interests, he often succeeds in his defiance and goes unpunished and unrepentant.''' ,'''Trump has raised the very issues I raised in the early '90s.''' ,'''If a country forgets where it came from, how will its people know who they are?''' ,'''I'm not a libertarian in the sense that I think all these social programs should be abolished in any sense.''' ,'''In 2013, a great national coalition came together to compel Congress to deny Barack Obama authority to take us to war in Syria.''' ,'''That a district judge would overrule the president of the United States on a matter of border security in wartime is absurd.''' ,'''If the Islamic world is so suffused with rage and hatred of us - for our wars, occupations, drone attacks, support of Israel, decadent culture, and tolerance of insults to Islam and the Prophet - why should we call for free elections, when the people will use those elections to vote into power rulers hostile to the United States?''' ,'''On right-to-life, see the Republicans flee from Todd Akin, who committed a gaffe while restating his support for what has been a plank of the Republican platform since 1980.''' ,'''I opposed NAFTA in 1993 and '94.''' ,'''Saying the Washington Post is just a newspaper is like saying Rasputin was just a country priest.''' ,'''President Trump's seeming renunciation of an anti-interventionist foreign policy is the great surprise of the first 100 days, and the most ominous.

But what did these bombings accomplish?''' ,'''Defeat has its lessons as well as victory.''' ,'''If Trump's talking to Putin can help end the bloodshed in Ukraine or Syria, it would appear to be at least as ethical an act as pulpiteering about our moral superiority on the Sunday talk shows.''' ,'''Anti-Catholicism is the anti-Semitism of the intellectual.''' ,'''Our own CIA has a storied history of interfering in elections.

Russia, China and Japan retain the freedom to decide whether and how to react, should war break out. Why do we not?''' ,'''If there is a horrific attack on this country like 9/11, the American people will demand we go to war and settle accounts with those who did it. But America's appetite for intervention, for nation building, for democracy crusades, is fully sated.''' ,'''While the Assads are despotic, George H.W.
