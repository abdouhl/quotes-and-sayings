- I love small weird art movies, and I love free mass entertainment.

- There really is a lot of pressure on actresses to look a strange and unrealistic way. You're not supposed to age. You're supposed to be perpetually incredibly attractive because that's the way the movie world is.
- In Hollywood, nobody knows how much everyone is making. It's all very hidden, and it's hard to change those things.
- I didn't want to be looked at. I remember when I was six or seven asking my mom why people were looking at me. She said, 'They're looking at you because you're a beautiful little girl.' But I didn't believe her. And yet I put myself in a business where people have to look at you. I think I learnt to block it out.

- This idea of the world expecting you to remain an ingenue forever - it's a very short shelf life if you're going to commit to that as your career, and I knew that early.

- I liked the premise of this material. I love the marriage relationship. They kind of keep each other honest, and they enjoy each other's sense of humor. Kind of a sexy but boring relationship.
- I find that men are far more vain than women.
- Financiers don't support their directors to cast properly. They don't have the vision of an artist. They're casting to spreadsheets, and it's making movies very mediocre. The movie business used to just be called the movies. Now it should be the business movies.

- Everyone should help women. Everyone has a vested interest.
- You want your partner to objectify you.
- Every single lesbian and transgender woman is a woman.
- Some people will stop a scene and demand a mirror and look at themselves and check which angles they're being photographed from. I don't do that.
- I feel like I'm getting the best parts of my career in my 50s.
- We all go through life living in little bubbles, which we share with people who think pretty much the same as us.
- When I was tiny, I was a real observer of human behaviour, and I knew I wanted to tell the human story, but I felt shy and unattractive and awkward.
- I didn't think of myself as beautiful, but, in retrospect, I guess I was.
- For some people, when you walk into a room, what your fame means to them can be like pointing a weird gun at them. It triggers something. They might get really giggly or flirty or cold or confrontational.
- I think everybody wants love, and everybody wants to feel alive.

- I grew up in a hippie commune so I have a real hippie part of me.
- Frankly, there is no shorter shelf life other than that of a child actor, than that of the ingenue.
