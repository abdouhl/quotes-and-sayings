- Life's there to make the most of, and that's what I do.
- I'm not going to be a ten or twelve grand-slam winner. It's not going to happen.
- I don't know if Wimbledon's seen anything like it. I don't know if they will again. But it was just - it was electric. The Aussie crowd, I'm really proud of them, the way they conducted themselves. You know they're great losers, as well.
- You've got to be realistic.
- I'm not that good a player, and I'll be the first to admit that. I might be a three or four grand-slam winner; I might be a two grand-slam winner, I don't know.
- I'm the sort of person who keeps a lot to myself.
- I'm sick of making bloody history.
