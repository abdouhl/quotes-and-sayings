- My mum worked as a secretary for Christian Dior. She looked like a movie star.

- I'm happy to be at home with the kids, in my flannel pajamas; that's a treat.
- I am a survivor and not a victim. Life isn't perfect. When you get a knock, you have to get up, dust yourself down and get on with it.
- If you're in love with someone maybe you can show it too much.
- I'm Catholic and Mum taught me the comfort that you can get from going to church. But I'm an a la carte Catholic. I love all the pomp and ceremony of it.

- Dad was the first man I fell in love with. He was a very funny man. He grew up in the East End of London and was very dynamic, and I understood why my mother fell in love with him.
- I most want to be remembered for being as great a mother to James and Lennon as my mum was to me and my brother Jamie.
- Up until the age of 30 I could eat whatever I wanted - I mean, literally, I never put on a pound; if anything, I was criticised in the media for being too skinny.
- I am actually really boring and I lead a quiet life. I love being at home, cooking for my boys, watching movies and I like nothing better than to go to bed early with a book.
- I am a happy person and I choose to be a positive person. I think some people think my life has been tragic and there have been these horrible dramas but things really have been, and are, fine.
