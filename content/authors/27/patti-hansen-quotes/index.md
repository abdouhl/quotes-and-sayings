- I loved when my boyfriends would call me their Amazon girl.
- I never wanted to disappoint my family at all.
- I don't want to write a book; I don't want to go on T.V., because I stink at it. The only thing I have always been comfortable with is being in magazines.
- I never wore flats: The higher the shoe, the better.
- Everyone thinks I'm this jock of a woman, but I didn't play any sports. I didn't even let my kids play baseball because I was afraid they were going to get hit by balls.
