Can we say that about many of our other leaders today in America, including on the right wing?''' ,'''So one important lesson of Vietnam is, the first casualty of an unwise and unjust war are the American troops called on to fight it. Their service should be honored.''' ,'''Bush began helping Enron in the eighties.''' ,'''But I think what happened was that Clinton knew how to fight back. And the way he fought back was on the issues - being tough in staying on the things that mattered to people in their lives.''' ,'''It taught me that Clinton's instinct to make this about your life as a citizen, rather than his as a human being, was the right answer to these things.''' ,'''Never interrupt your opponent when he's destroying himself.''' ,'''I'm very sunny. You know, I'm always optimistic.''' ,'''I think too many Democrats are too wimpy. But I think they're beginning to toughen up.''' ,'''Defining the terms of the debate generally dictates who's gonna' win it.''' ,'''One of the problems we saw in the last presidential election in our party is that our nominee, while winning the election, which we ought never to forget, often lost sight of the difference between strategy and tactics.''' ,'''I'm a Catholic, but I used to love going to Vacation Bible School with my fundamentalist friends.''' ,'''See, I think if it just became who's sleeping with whom, then there's no reason to prefer one party over the other, 'cause the truth is we're all sinners.''' ,'''Politics is show business for ugly people.''' ,'''I try hard to be a good Catholic.''' ,'''I was the guy that told Bill Clinton he was going to win. I had gotten the final polling numbers. He had a comfortable lead. He was not going to lose.''' ,'''I used to go in at 5:30 or 6:00 so I could run.''' ,'''Again, President Reagan was sort of an amiable presence out at the ranch by the last 6 months of his presidency. He had no effect on national policy at all.''' ,'''It must kill George Bush that John McCain is the most popular and Beloved Republican in America.''' ,'''Again and again, I've seen Bush turn a blind eye as his henchmen have leveled zealous attacks against his political enemies - assaults which the president himself has sometimes directly encouraged.''' ,'''My view was that the campaign had been a sacred thing, that it had been a real compact, because I was there and I saw the connection that Clinton made with people, and the connection that they made with him.''' ,]
