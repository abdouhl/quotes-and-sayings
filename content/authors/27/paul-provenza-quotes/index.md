quotes = ['''Career is a mindset. The wrong mindset. Career is linear. Especially when you are trapped in the TV or film world. The next thing you do has always got to be bigger, or it is perceived as a failure.''' ,'''Comedy is inherently subversive because it turns the normal reality on its head. The art form is all about these questions and contradictions. In comedy, we're dealing with language that we all understand, but words can have a dozen other things around them that alter or affect meaning.''' ,'''Social media allows comics to bypass the gatekeepers and connect directly with people who will want to come see them.''' ,'''George Carlin maintained that anything and everything is funny given the right context.
