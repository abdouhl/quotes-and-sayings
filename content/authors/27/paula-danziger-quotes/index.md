- In my next life, I want to be tall and thin, parallel park and make good coffee. But for now, I have lots of stuff to work out in my life, but I'll have that until the day I die. I want to write more books.
- I tried to write with someone else once before, but it was not successful.
- I try to be careful because technology changes so much over the years. But some things don't change. Kids and parents have disagreements, kids try to manipulate, parents try to sit down with rules and regs. That part never changes.
- At age 12, I was put on tranquilizers when I should have gotten help. There was nothing major and awful, I just didn't feel my family was supportive and emotionally generous.
- Normally, I name my characters after famous comedians.
- Sometimes it's easier to show than it is to tell.
- I deal with unhappy marriages a lot. I've never been married, I'm single.
- I think my books talk about kids learning to like and respect themselves and each other. You can't write a message book; you just tell the best story you know how to tell.
- My father was a very unhappy person, very sarcastic, and my mother was very nervous and worried about what people thought. They weren't monsters, but it wasn't a good childhood.
- When my father would yell at me, I told myself someday I'd use it in a book.
- I made the choice long ago to write about real life. And life is both serious and funny.
- None of my characters seem to have had sex yet - I haven't written about that. And I wouldn't want to deal with what's happening in Oregon - the school shootings.
- The books are funny and sad, and that's what people respond to.
- I'm very lucky. I'm very fortunate that my books have never gone out of print - none of them.
- I didn't expect to be doing a whole bunch of Amber Browns. And because it was just one book, and the father had moved away, I didn't realize I was going to have to deal more with shared custody, divorce and all those issues.
- I wish I had had my books when I was a kid, I do.
- I want to keep meeting new people, enlarging my circle of friends. I have great friends now... really good people. But I'm always ready for what comes next.
