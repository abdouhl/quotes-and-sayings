- I was a copy editor. I loved it. I love grammar. I'm obsessed. I was a bartender. I worked in a cafe. I was a dog walker. I was a babysitter. I was a tutor. Once I was asked to half-babysit, half-bartend.
- I really have a love-hate relationship with New York. I will talk to New York and be like, 'You are so hard on me. You are so difficult to be around. Why?'
- I enjoy writing and directing a lot. For a long time, I was dabbling in many different things. I've been thinking of an analogy, and I think it works. It's like I had all these different flowers and I was watering them all evenly, so they were growing at the same level.

- I moved to Paris and I didn't really know what I wanted to do, but I moved in with a friend who had an apartment there and was looking for a roommate. Quickly, I discovered that I didn't know what exactly I wanted to do, but I wanted it to be a little creative.
- I became a really good student at Bard and I fell in love with learning.
- I have so many ideas and stories that I want to tell. But sitting down to write is a hard thing to do.
- I double-majored in Political Studies and Theatre & Performance.
- My way into everything was through the theater. There are so many plays that I saw growing up that just made me realize that I wanted to be on stage doing that. So it was definitely through ballet, and then stage, and then theater and acting. And then I kind of made my way to film.
- I took a two-year break in college where I was just studying politics - I did political studies and became obsessed with comparative politics.
- Well, I grew up in Hell's Kitchen, right next to Times Square, in a subsidized arts building.
- By the time I graduated from high school, though, I was in a bit of a rebellious phase towards everything I had known growing up.
- I had a full college experience. I kind of learned how to be a good student at Bard. I had never really cared about academics, but in college I learned the power of - I don't want to say the power of knowledge, but the power of curiosity.
