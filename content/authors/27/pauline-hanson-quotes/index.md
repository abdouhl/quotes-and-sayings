quotes = ['''Governments must give to all those who have hit life's hurdles the chance to rebuild and have a future.''' ,'''This nation is being divided into black and white, and the present system encourages this.''' ,'''I believe we are in danger of being swamped by Asians.''' ,'''If politicians continue to promote separatism in Australia, they should not continue to hold their seats in this parliament. They are not truly representing all Australians, and I call on the people to throw them out.''' ,'''I will fight hard to keep my seat in this place, but that will depend on the people who sent me here.''' ,'''Islam does not believe in democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, or freedom of assembly. It does not separate religion and politics. It is partly a religion, but it is much more than that. It has a political agenda that goes far outside the realm of religion.''' ,'''We have one of the highest interest rates in the world, and we owe more money per capita than any other country. All we need is a nail hole in the bottom of the boat and we're sunk.''' ,'''My view on issues is based on common sense, and my experience as a mother of four children, as a sole parent, and as a businesswoman running a fish and chip shop.''' ,'''The majority of Aboriginals do not want handouts because they realise that welfare is killing them.''' ,'''We have lost all our big Australian industries and icons, including Qantas when it sold 25 % of its shares and a controlling interest to British Airways.''' ,'''A social problem is one that concerns the way in which people live together in one society. A racial problem is a problem which confronts two different races who live in two separate societies, even if those societies are side by side.''' ,'''To survive in peace and harmony, united and strong, we must have one people, one nation, one flag.''' ,'''The government must do all it can to help reduce interest rates for business.''' ,'''I may be only a fish and chip shop lady, but some of these economists need to get their heads out of the textbooks and get a job in the real world. I would not even let one of them handle my grocery shopping.''' ,'''There is no sign saying 'good Muslim' or 'bad Muslim.' How many lives will be lost or destroyed trying to determine who is good or who is bad?''' ,'''We must look after our own before lining the pockets of overseas countries and investors.''' ,'''The World Health Organisation has a lot of its medical experts sitting in Geneva while hospitals in Africa have no drugs and desperate patients are forced to seek medication on the black market.''' ,'''I do not believe that the colour of one's skin determines whether you are disadvantaged.''' ,'''Tolerance has to be shown by those who come to this country for a new way of life. If you are not prepared to become Australian and give this country your undivided loyalty, obey our laws, respect our culture and way of life, then I suggest you go back where you came from.''' ,'''Islam cannot have a significant presence in Australia if we are to live in an open, secular, and cohesive society. We have seen the destruction it is causing around the world.''' ,'''I come here not as a polished politician but as a woman who has had her fair share of life's knocks.''' ,'''Australia has embraced migrants from all different races, making us one of the most multiracial nations on earth. Most have assimilated and are proud to call themselves Australians, accepting our culture, beliefs and laws. I welcome them from the bottom of my heart. As they integrate and assimilate, the disruption caused by diversity diminishes.''' ,'''In this financial year we will be spending at least $1.5 billion on foreign aid and we cannot be sure that this money will be properly spent, as corruption and mismanagement in many of the recipient countries are legend.''' ,'''It is refreshing to be able to express my views without having to toe a party line. It has got me into trouble on the odd occasion, but I am not going to stop saying what I think.''' ,'''We are regarded as a Third World country with First World living conditions.''' ,]
