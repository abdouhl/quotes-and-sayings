- We're much more controlled now. We were kids back then, we each had our own demons. It was insanity.
- When 'Destroyer' was first released, we got a strong backlash from our hardcore fans. After six months, the album was dead in the water. The critics didn't think much of it, either.
- Cool things happen. Ace's guitar flies through space, goes through a hole, and blows up. I throw drumsticks and they come flying at you.
- Musicians play music because you love... I loved to play drums since I was five. It's all I ever wanted to do. Rock stars, or as we call them, posers, guys who want to just look great, dress great. They're not musicians; they're looking for the fame.

- I'm from Brooklyn. I grew up very poor- seven people, four rooms. My dad had no education.
- There's not a day that goes by that I don't bless myself with holy water and then get in my car and rub the medal of the Virgin Mary that she gave me and say a Hail Mary for my mother. And then I kiss her Mass card that's right there on the dashboard.
- Three times during the show the drums are lifted over the audience - I go up and out, right, left and back.
- As busy as I claim to be, I've still got the greatest job in the world.
- I think money, power, fame changes people a lot.
- I find myself evil. I believe in the devil as much as God. You can use either one to get things done.
- The magic's back and we're in a time tunnel, feeling like when we were in our 20s back in the 1970s.
- We're playing the Superbowl this year, we're opening up before the coins drop.
