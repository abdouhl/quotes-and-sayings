- I think the best dramas are as funny as possible and the best comedies have, underneath them, real substance.
- Over the course of my creative life, I've trafficked in broken, heroic mothers.
- When you have an intimate encounter with mortality as my family and I did with my mom's death, I took a long look at my life and I asked myself what was the one thing that I hadn't done that I had really wanted to do. And it was to write and direct a film.

- The most autobiographical thing I've ever written is my second novel, called 'An Ocean in Iowa.' That is pretty close to my childhood.
- I want to make a series of films of contemporary America that feel urgent and deal with sometimes-topical matters, but hopefully in a universal way.

- I make sure when I direct that it's a very joy-based set that hopefully is filled with a lot of respect.

- The kinds of movies I make are not easy to get made.
- When I did 'Gilbert Grape,' Lasse Hallstrom let me be on the set with him and in the editing room and in the casting sessions and so on. And so I got a firsthand, rather intimate, high-pressure look at how to make a film.
- There are very few topics where I can imagine that you might not find humor. And I was stunned at how much weird and dark humor there was when my mom died.
- And for better or worse, a story like 'Pieces of April' is the kind of story I'm supposed to tell. The kind of story that makes you laugh as much as possible but also breaks your heart.

- Well, it made perfect sense that I originally wanted to be an actor because every Sunday, we walked into church and we acted like we were the happiest, most together family.
- There are so many films I lean on and look toward and return to that give me some guidance on how to keep moving in the world, and that's what film does, at its best.
- Black people are more likely to be incarcerated than white people. That's just a fact and it's regrettable and it's got to change.

- Is my job as a child, even as an adult, is my job to heal the wounds of my parents' childhoods?

- I don't know if a mother's love and a father's love is that different.
- My mother's sobriety - that's when I found the theater, that's when I moved from being a basketball player to being a musician, to being an actor, to then being a writer.

Then the mother lifted up the car to pull her child to safety. And I believe that my own strength comes from whom and what I love.
- I'm the lucky father to two young men. When any of your kids, and your parents feel this way about you, clearly, when your kids find what they love to do and they throw themselves into it, and they find joy in the doing of it, and it's actually work that's honorable, and, you know, all of those things, it's a great feeling.

- When I was a young lad just out of college at the North Carolina School of the Arts, I directed several plays that I wrote. It was essential theater, meaning we had no money, so our set may be six stools and two chairs and eight cream pies.
- New York just feels real to me, and not everyone is in the movie business.
- I've read both books that 'Beautiful Boy' is based on, and I can't wait to see that film. I root for that film.
- I took a look at my own life and realized that I was overinvesting in my kids. I realized that I had to get out of the way and let them be who they wanted to be, not what I wanted them to be.
- In my family, if something were to have happened with one of my kids, I think my wife would be the tougher one.
- I play this game with my son called Never Seen. We try to see new things every day, and we do. I don't take that for granted.
- There are sections of the film that I don't love. There are moments that really lift and elevate, and then there are parts that feel clunkier to me. But the totality of 'Harold and Maude' is so much greater than maybe other films that are more perfect or look more beautiful or handle every moment more exquisitely.
