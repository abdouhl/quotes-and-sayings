- Neuer is simply sensational.
- Such great goalkeepers have played in England over the years - the likes of Gordon Banks, Peter Shilton, and Bert Trautmann.
- Any beginning is difficult, but when you're opening the newspaper every day, and it's all about how bad you are, sometimes even you begin to believe that.
- You have to believe you can win.

- Manchester United would like to have world class players.
- I am very proud to join the Hall of Fame.
- Even when I went to Aston Villa, it was very important that I was not in competition with Manchester United.
- Every player makes mistakes; every goalkeeper makes mistakes. Every manager does, every broadcaster - every person in life makes mistakes. But for goalkeepers, often when they make a mistake, it leads to a goal.
- I don't think spending money is a guarantee for anything.
- When you look at the goals he has been criticised for, at some point they could have been prevented by a defender, or it was a misunderstanding. It is not down to Joe Hart on his own.
- Guardiola has a way of playing; he has a system, and he sticks to that.
- Joe Hart has bags and bags of talent.
- I want to see Pogba being a Manchester United player and being as good as everything else he does in life. He's absolutely brilliant on social media, and he's projecting himself to be this incredibly modern player.
- If he is having a bad game, a team-mate might feel Paul Scholes is not quite on his game, but a spectator wouldn't notice. Scholes, of all the players I have played with, has the highest bottom level.
- You have to bear in mind where Louis van Gaal has worked before. His self-belief is bigger than Jose Mourinho's.
- With a club like Manchester United that have history and traditions, I think the manager at the club should respect that.
- When you're young, you want to do everything. You want to go out and find girls; you want to have a drink - there are a lot of things you want to do. But if you want to make it to the top, there are a lot of things you can't do.
- People say that Andrea Pirlo is the main player and that everything goes through him, but that's an illusion. Pirlo is a brilliant player but doesn't dominate Italy's play as much as people say.
- Penalty shoot-outs are the most high-pressure situation that a goalkeeper will face, and in a World Cup, it's even worse because the stakes are so high.
- I am crazy about Leicester; I am crazy about the owners - they are fantastic and really good for the Premier League.
- At Manchester United, you can have a bad day, and the supporters understand. Even in a crunch game, you can have a bad result, and they still back the team.
- I have had a fantastic career with United, and I owe it to the club, players, and fans to do everything I can to finish on a successful note.
- In three weeks, you can improve a lot. You can train a lot. You can come up with a proper plan.

- Kids want to play in goal.
- For 99.9% of the players there, they are at United because they want to be at United, and it is their dream move. That gives United a little bit of an advantage over other clubs, where some players are maybe there because there was financial pressure for them to be sold.
- I, as a fan, want to be winning but to entertain equally as much, too.

- At United, everyone is there because they want to be there.
- There's no doubt: nobody can argue that Manchester United is not the biggest club in the world. It is.
- It is very nice Kasper has now also won the Premier League, too. I am very proud; I think he has done a fantastic job. It has been amazing to bring this lad into the world and bring him up and hear his wishes and hopes for the future, his ambitions; he made it fairly clear early on that he wanted to become a footballer.
- I would have come to play at United for absolutely nothing if I'd been given the chance - everyone I played with at the time would have done that, too.
- The big clubs will always talk about the same names such as Ancelotti, Mourinho, and Wenger. Louis Van Gaal is always in there as well. He has his own style and is a very determined man. He knows exactly what he wants. He's got direction, the ability and experience at big clubs such as Barcelona and Bayern Munich.
- I'm quite good at golf. I'm not amazing, but I play a lot.
- Sir Alex is so consistent with his management. He manages each person differently, but you know exactly where you are with him. You know exactly what is required.
- I have no regrets about leaving, and I don't miss being at United at all.
- People talk about the hair dryer and all this with Sir Alex Ferguson. What was really great about him, whatever happened in a game, he would spend whatever minutes it took him to get this out of this system and say whatever needed to be said. Once he said, 'Get your bath,' that was it. We knew that it would never return.
- If we should have any regrets as Manchester United, that is that we only gave David Moyes seven months. I think we should have given him more time, accepted that results weren't going to be the way we hoped they would be and that playing would be a little bit different. I believe he would have grown into that role.

- I think, in Denmark, we are quite good when it comes to the environment.
- When David De Gea first came to the Premier League, he was a small boy.
- If you have been brought up with attacking and trying to get to number two, number three, number four goal, not getting one goal and defend, if that's sort of the mentality that's engraved in you, it's really difficult to do the other thing.
- On some occasions, it is every footballer's dream to play for the national team, but if you don't reach it, you always need to work harder to reach a higher level, a level you wouldn't reach if you didn't have this as a goal.
- Sometimes you've just got to hold your hands up and say you've been beaten by a quality free-kick.
- I am a massive fan of Wayne Rooney, and it is nice to see him play in any position because he gives a 100 per cent. Not many players can do that and say they do that.
- Goalkeeping is very, very much about confidence and thinking you are the man.
- Today, the biggest clubs in the world, they buy the players they need for whatever way they think they have to play.
- There are hundreds of players who are trying to be a Beckham or Cantona but do not have the personality, and they fail.
- I read about Zlatan Ibrahimovic in the newspapers. I would love for him to come to Manchester United; I've said this for a long time. He was born to play for Manchester United.
- Neuer is the best goalkeeper in the world by far.
- I was one of the first foreign players coming in to the Premier League.
- The thing about being a striker is you need to be lightning-fast.
- The star-jump technique - that is a big part of being a handball goalkeeper, and I brought that move into football. It is a very effective way of saving a chance.
- The fear of letting people down - that's the drive. Sir Alex, I think, if he was brave enough to say it, he would say the same, but in his eyes, the motivating factor is that you want to be the best.
- You've got to get a certain amount of sleep. You've got to eat the right thing. You've got to train in the right manner. You've got to behave in the right manner.

- I want exciting players.
- If you're mentally ready, you're willing to go the extra mile.
- Football is a team sport. I'm proud of what I achieved in my career, but I also know that I wouldn't have achieved any of it without the support of my team-mates. I played with great players, great managers, and in great teams.

- Real Madrid will be the first team to claim two Champions League trophies in a row.
- Knowing where a team will usually place a penalty can be the difference between winning or losing.
- Joe Hart has come in for a bit of criticism, but it's only because he's the England goalkeeper, and he's not got any competition. It's always been like that; it's just the way the English media works. Joe Hart is a tough cookie, and he won't listen to any of that.

- It's not the mistake that's important; it's how you recover from it. If you recover instantly, in that second, it's gone from your mind. You play on and don't make the next mistake, and that's the sign of a top keeper. Joe Hart certainly is one of those guys.
