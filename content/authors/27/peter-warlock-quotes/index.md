- All good music, whatever its date, is ageless - as alive and significant today as it was when it was written.
- All old music was modern once, and much more of the music of yesterday already sounds more old-fashioned than works which were written three centuries ago.
- Dates and periods are of interest only to the student of musical history.
- Music is neither old nor modern: it is either good or bad music, and the date at which it was written has no significance whatever.
