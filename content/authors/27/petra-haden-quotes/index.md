I immediately loved the piano and just how simple it is.''' ,'''I wish I finished music school, because then I feel like I could talk more about the dissonant notes.''' ,'''I always related my favorite music to the movies.''' ,'''When I was recording my first solo album 'Imaginaryland,' I was listening to a lot of movie scores.''' ,'''I remember watching Looney Tunes cartoons and having the music stuck in my head.''' ,'''Old film-noir movies. There's something comforting about watching black-and-white movies, and hearing this kind of music just puts me in a fantasy world. It's a really great escape for me.''' ,'''That's what I love about those old movies - the music is like a constant companion.

I started with the bass, and either doubled that and then added the harmonies, or sometimes added my own harmonies that I've always wanted to sing on the song.
