- With darts it's just one against one, it's blow for blow. The only thing I could compare it to is boxing. It's dead exciting. You're reacting to each other, the adrenaline's pumping. You don't feel calm at all. But it's all about being able to win when you're pumped up. People say you don't play the player; I play the player every time.
- I don't know why I am liked. I think it's probably because I've just been normal, not been flash or tried to hurt anybody. I'm not one for going out and going to nightclubs. I'd rather stay in and watch a good movie.

- These youngsters coming into the sport are bright lads. They see how much money there is now and they realise you've got to be fitter and stronger than the others.

- You know what, December's a funny time of the year, because the weather changes, the central heating comes on; sometimes you can get colds and coughs and flu.
- You can't know the dedication it takes to win 16 world titles until you do it yourself. I didn't know what John Lowe had to do before me. I respected him because that's how I was brought up - but I respect him more now that I've done it myself.
- Well, when you've got nothing, you're always looking forward to having something.
- When we were travelling in different countries I felt like I was jetlagged eight months of the year.
- We had this little yard, and during the summer holidays, when my mum and dad were working, I spent hours bowling a golf ball at a stick. Just bowling, bowling, bowling. And I got to where I could hit the stick every time, repeating the same action. That's where the darts came from.

- That first world title has to be the most wonderful moment and to beat Bristow, the No 1 in the world, was the ultimate. There's not many matches I remember, but I do remember that one, remember playing really, really well. Bristow was so upset he wouldn't talk to me for a few weeks after I beat him.
