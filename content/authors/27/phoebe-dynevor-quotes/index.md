quotes = ['''Actors just seemed like really fascinating people.''' ,'''Just working with Shondaland, I felt really safe as a woman, I think, particularly just knowing that I wasn't going to be taken advantage of in any way.''' ,'''To be honest, when I was younger, I went to schools that made me aware I wasn't the brightest.''' ,'''I remember having my first fitting and being like, 'Oh, my God,' because they literally built a factory just for Bridgerton' costumes.''' ,'''I was doing drama and I wasn't sporty or cool I think there's definitely something about being an outsider and getting into the industry - maybe it's because you have something to prove?''' ,'''I particularly love the Regency era.''' ,'''In real life my mum was always a dungaree wearer, which probably rubbed off on me a lot. Work for her was the dressy time, not home, and I always thought that was kind of cool.''' ,'''There's not many TV series that do that, that focus on different characters every season.''' ,'''I meditate, I have a therapist, I walk every day.''' ,'''Piano, I'm not so good at.''' ,'''The advice I'd give to my younger self? Stay in your own lane, maybe.''' ,'''I don't think you can ever really prepare yourself for something to hit like Bridgerton' did, because there's not many things that hit like that.''' ,'''I did love the glamour of going out and had a couple of years when there was a lot of make-up and false eyelashes.''' ,'''I'm sure a lot of people go into this industry quite blind as to what it will be like. There's a lot of rejection, but I knew that. My parents have been super-supportive, they told me from the start, 'Just keep going.'''' ,'''I was so nervous about dancing because I've always thought of myself as a terrible dancer.''' ,'''I've always said - I don't know why - that I didn't like horses and was scared of them.''' ,'''I think Bridgerton' transports you into a different world. It's witty, vibrant, fun and sexy and yet its themes are relevant to the world we're living in today.''' ,'''At 17, I was finally in a school play.''' ,'''To me, the costume does half the job for you, or even more than half of the job.''' ,'''Stop focusing on the noise and the expectations of others, and focus on what makes you happy.''' ,'''What I love about Bridgerton' though is that the women in it do have their own agency within the context of the time. In fact, Daphne is actually quite a feminist character because she's in control of her destiny.''' ,'''Daphne is the eldest of the Bridgerton daughters, so she is the first to make her debut on the marriage mart and she's waited her whole life for this moment. When we meet her, she conforms to the social pressures placed on young women at the time but as she evolves, she very much finds her voice.''' ,'''I'd love to do a play eventually, if theaters ever open again.''' ,'''I'm really interested in how people's minds work - what makes them sad or happy.''' ,'''I'm not a big reality TV person, although recently someone got me into 90 Day Fiance,' which is pretty addictive.''' ,'''Every time I finish a job I seem to want to dress in totally the opposite way to the character.''' ,'''The Peak District is an insanely beautiful location to work in, the views are just wonderful.''' ,'''My mum always tells the story that, when she was pregnant with me, and I was two weeks late, she would watch Mary Poppins over and over again to try and get me to come out. That is my relationship with Julie Andrews.''' ,'''In a lot of the Regency stuff we've seen in the past, we see a very composed woman. There's not much sexuality there. It's very much the male gaze.''' ,'''I grew up in the era of Keira Knightley, so I've seen every one of her movies a few times.''' ,'''The special thing about Bridgerton' that I think not a lot of shows really do is that every season centers around a different love story.''' ,'''My mum grew up in Oldham and was going to work at a cigarette factory till she decided to go to drama school, so there's part of me that wants to represent the Northern working-class background.''' ,'''There's something about the waltz in particular, where one person leads and the other follows, that helps you get in tune with each other.''' ,'''Sometimes with auditions and going up for a role, you don't want to admit to yourself that it's everything you've ever wanted.''' ,'''So many times I've seen that done where it's the man laying back in bed, with his chubby belly, and the woman is absolutely gorgeous in every way, and you see all of her beautiful backside. To flip that on its head was so interesting to me.''' ,'''I'd say Bridgerton' has definitely changed my life. But not only in the things that have come from the job, but also just the experience of it and meeting the most incredible people; just learning so much from working so hard for that period of time.''' ,'''I worry about everything. I'm full of anxiety.''' ,'''You see what it is for your mental health to be in the public eye.''' ,'''There are a lot of differences between me and Daphne but I think she values family, which I also value, and at a time when women had only one option, she was as determined to make that happen as I am in my career I guess, and I think that was sort of my way into Daphne.''' ,'''We did have a beautiful cottage in the Lake District which we spent lots of time in when I was younger.''' ,'''I think that a costume can really help in embodying a character. So dressing up in something completely different to what you would usually wear is so new and refreshing.''' ,'''There's definitely something to be said for having a dancing partner and trusting each other and having to create something together which then really informs the performance, in a way.''' ,'''I actually have a history of doing quite a few period dramas, but I think I really specifically wanted to do the Regency era, and to be able to do high-society Regency era is even more amazing.''' ,'''Being able to do a role where you learn a new skill is just such a dream. I recently played a potter and got to learn pottery.''' ,'''My sister is nine years younger than I am.''' ,'''My mum and dad taught me to respect everyone and to be kind.''' ,'''I wasn't working before Bridgerton' for a long time.''' ,'''There is a potential threat in fame. I don't like the idea of it.''' ,'''I think the context of the era was still really important for Daphne's character arc, so I wanted to get all of that right.''' ,'''I had a really strange period in my early 20s with the industry, and not succeeding the way I wanted to, and I put a lot of pressure on myself.''' ,'''I love a good period drama.''' ,'''We all have to contribute in any way we can to telling stories that include everyone; that's our jobs, to speak out and make sure we're representing people.''' ,'''I've always just wanted to work on interesting projects.''' ,'''Everyone in my family has a weird leg in the industry. My grandpa was a director and my grandma was a third AD, so you'd always hear stories growing up just of being on set and of actors.''' ,'''The costume designer Ellen Mirojnick is a genius.''' ,'''It's nice, in a weird way, to be with my family.''' ,'''The only thing I do for everything is read the script a billion times, back to front, every single bit.''' ,'''I have been wearing a lot of track suits.''' ,'''There was a lot of giggling on the Bridgerton' set.''' ,'''I have a fear of failure, letting someone down, contradicting myself.''' ,'''With Daphne half the work was done for me once I was cinched into that corset. Immediately, because of the way the corset is fitted, your posture is held back, which means your head's up, and you are moving in a certain way.''' ,'''You have to stand up super-straight in those corsets and pull your shoulders back.''' ,'''Apparently, sitcoms are like the dream job, I've been told. The hours are great, apparently.''' ,'''With Daphne, there was a huge part of me going, This is my dream job, literally my dream role, but there's no way I'm going to get it. So I may as well just do it how I want to do it, and not think about anyone else.' That was quite a good thing.''' ,'''We have the time now to actually find ourselves before we settle down and marry and have kids. But for someone like Daphne, her only way of finding herself and figuring out who she is is through getting married.''' ,'''I would have hated living in 1813. It wouldn't have been my cup of tea at all.''' ,'''I think society doesn't really change, technology does.''' ,'''I was starting to write and I was like, Okay, I'm going to cast myself in my own thing.' You have so many of those moments as an actor because it's about talent obviously, but it's mostly about being in the right place at the right time.''' ,'''There's always something that I really need to do for a role. And for Bridgerton,' it was, I need to make this person relatable and real, and modernize her.''' ,'''I heard, 'Shondaland is doing Regency England with Netflix,' and I was like, 'I'm in!'''' ,'''I've always said that I couldn't dance.''' ,'''I used to be a huge Spice Girls fan, so having Victoria Beckham tag me in a story was unbelievable.''' ,'''I've always wanted to do a period drama - I love the costumes and the make-up.''' ,'''When I first read the Bridgerton' script, it blew me away.''' ,'''I always hear about people falling in love with their costars. It's yet to happen to me, but I'm intrigued.''' ,'''I was lucky because I only had a half-corset, so it wasn't bad. You do get used to them, but I was very relieved to take it off at the end of the day.''' ,'''When you're on the cusp of throwing in the towel, something will yo-yo you back in!''' ,'''My grandmother Shelley was an actress and would tell me about working in the theatre, while my grandpa on Dad's side, Gerard Dynevor, was a big influence in theatre and a TV director.''' ,'''Everyone has days where they wake up and feel like poo and don't want to see people, let alone be on camera.''' ,'''I was gonna be an actor and no one was stopping me.''' ,'''I've always loved fashion, though I'm not good with brands.''' ,'''As for actors, I'm hugely in awe of Cate Blanchett - and Meryl Streep, obviously.''' ,'''My grandma worked her whole life as a single mother.''' ,'''I think at 17, if I'd have seen a show that was really geared towards a woman's sexuality and her finding that and not the male, and not the woman being sexualized, it would have been so interesting to see that growing up.''' ,'''There's nothing like rehearsing a waltz to a Stormzy track. It's hard to compare it to anything!''' ,'''I sometimes wish that 21st century women could wear skirts and dresses every day without looking overdressed.''' ,'''In real life my mum was always a dungaree wearer, which probably rubbed off on me a lot.''' ,'''I had been living in L.A. for about nine months, and I was kind of at that point where I was ready to go home, and sort of throw in the towel.''' ,'''All I remember is being like, 'Oh, that's Shonda Rhimes,' and getting a bit nervous.''' ,'''What makes me happiest? Either being around people that I love, or working on something that I love.''' ,'''I think the problem today is that there is no social etiquette.''' ,'''I'm obsessed with every single album from Jhene Aiko.''' ,'''I don't think I'm a neck actor in otherthings. But in Bridgerton,' particularly with the way the corset sits andthe attentionon the neck, it makes you hold yourshouldersacertain way.''' ,]
