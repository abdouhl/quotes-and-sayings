- They've participated extensively in this conference and they are doing their best to help.
- But had they not paid that advance we would have lost much more, we would have started to go and look for the product all over again, the refinery would have stopped working.

- They are responsible for starting this relationship and wanting to help Africa. The United States is very well suited for this as they are a country that has the capacity, they have better access to technology and they are a successful country.
- We hope that there will be better policy-making and hope to see projects implemented. We have lots of information that can be used for the implementation of projects.
