- What I try to do is find a language for life.
- I'm not interested in how people move, but what moves them.
- When I first began choreographing, I never thought of it as choreography but as expressing feelings. Though every piece is different, they are all trying to get at certain things that are difficult to put into words. In the work, everything belongs to everything else - the music, the set, the movement and whatever is said.
- I want to feel something, as a person. I don't want to be bored.
- Everything must come from the heart, must be lived.
- It was not like I planned even to be a choreographer. It just happened to me somehow.
