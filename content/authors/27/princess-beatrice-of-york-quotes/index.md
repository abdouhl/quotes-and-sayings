- When I was younger, I was diagnosed with dyslexia, which meant, for me, sitting in front of a book was really hard - until I discovered Harry Potter, and this character, this 11-year-old boy, who suddenly gets off to school for the first time, captured my imagination, and suddenly reading was fun. Reading was inspiring, and I was motivated.
- You have to find an identity that's true to yourself. You really have to find your own voice.
- Learning is the gateway to adventure.
- I am greatly honoured to become Patron of The Helen Arkell Dyslexia Centre. I have benefited hugely from their work, and I am looking forward to supporting them in giving a chance to others to benefit from their experience and teaching.
- For me, school was a nightmare. I struggled.
- I was diagnosed with dyslexia when I was seven, and it was a bit of a struggle to begin with. It was a challenge as I began my school career - spelling and reading was something I couldn't really get my head around.
