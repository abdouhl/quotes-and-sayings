quotes = ['''No country has left the E.U. since Greenland in 1985 and no one believes that delivering what the people voted for will be a walk in the park, so it's important that the person ultimately chosen by the party membership is tried and tested, capable of making tough decisions and can lead a team negotiating with E.U. institutions.''' ,'''The European Union is becoming more economically feeble every year.''' ,'''Free trade is the way to bring jobs and prosperity.''' ,'''In times of crisis, the world looks to Britain not just for our work on the ground, but also for our leadership.''' ,'''Our police officers are on the front line of a battle to maintain control of our streets.''' ,'''The British people voted to take back control of our borders, trade, money and laws. They chose a bright future as a free, independent and sovereign country.''' ,'''Britain is at its best when we stand up for the values that we believe in.''' ,'''We all have legitimate concerns over the way our personal data is used and stored and it is right that there are protections to stop the theft and manipulation of our private information.''' ,'''As a nation, we face a choice. With parts of the world on fire, can we ignore the despair beyond our borders? Or do we use our global influence and leadership to confront these challenges head-on?''' ,'''The E.U., its institutions, structure and ways of working are an anachronism.''' ,'''If your country isn't stable and free from the threat of violence then you can't get to work, you can't get to the local clinic and your children can't go to school.''' ,'''The countries that succeed will be those that are nimble and able to use their human capital to take advantage of opportunities as they arise.''' ,'''Whether it was in the 1980s under Margaret Thatcher, the 1950s under Churchill and Macmillan or in the early days of the Cameron administration, when our party has spoken for the people we have won.''' ,'''The U.K. alone cannot be left to help those who have lost everything.''' ,'''On the Left, there is an emerging nostalgia on for renationalisation as a panacea for all our economic challenges. Every train fare increase, water price rise or electricity rate change triggers a well-orchestrated hue and cry for our essential infrastructure to be taken back into public hands.''' ,'''Britain has a long and proud record of welcoming migrants. They have made many positive contributions to our economy. But the impact of uncontrolled immigration from the E.U. has placed new pressures on our country.''' ,'''In a world of serious threats to the U.K. and to global stability, where we see violence and conflict pulling people back into poverty, international terrorism, migration crises, children dying from preventable diseases and global environmental concerns on the rise, Britain's leadership on the world stage is more important than ever.''' ,'''I campaigned for Brexit because I have always believed that Britain would be stronger, more prosperous and secure outside of the E.U.''' ,'''The truth is that the E.U. constrains us in all manner of ways and throws reams of red tape around British businesses.''' ,'''Instead of embracing change, the E.U.'s precautionary principle has held back progress.''' ,'''I know at first-hand the importance of hard work and the value of work experience.''' ,'''As David Cameron so brutally found out in 2015-16, there is limited appetite in Brussels to be helpful or flexible towards Britain.''' ,'''When Secretary of State for International Development, it was my mission to ensure that every taxpayer pound was spent to serve those in need, and met U.K. development objectives.''' ,'''Putting more money into families' pockets will help them with the rising cost of living, and reducing the tax burden on business will help foster the entrepreneurial spirit of those who want to start-up or grow their own firms.''' ,'''We are a free and independent country and will prosper if given a proper chance.''' ,'''One of the reasons people voted to leave the E.U. is so that we could have the freedom to strike trade deals with countries outside the E.U.

This will never change.''' ,'''As the great advocates of trade and liberal markets, Conservatives should guide our country through the transition from being one of twenty-eight in the E.U. to a strong, sovereign and independent country.''' ,'''Finding out whether I had made the grades for my first choice university course or whether I needed to rethink my future was terrifying.''' ,'''We must stand firm against the Left's nationalisation obsession.''' ,'''The purpose of Conservative Budgets is to empower the British people and revitalise the country.''' ,'''Brexit will not be easy.''' ,'''We should not listen to those who continue to repeat the disproved doom-mongering of 'Project Fear.'''' ,'''Far from doing what it can to ensure that the companies and entrepreneurs of tomorrow are European, the E.U. actively stifles innovation.''' ,'''There is so much for the U.K. to be proud of - a world-class, modern economy and a free, fair and tolerant society.''' ,'''If, like me, you believe that your taxes should be spent on your priorities in this country by politicians accountable to you then you should vote to leave the E.U.''' ,'''Our young people are some of the most dynamic and determined in the world.''' ,'''I have long witnessed the enormous contribution Britain makes around the world, with our impact through multilateral as well as through our bilateral engagement.''' ,'''The Single Market and Customs Union is not a true 'free' market. It is designed to suit the E.U. insiders, not the U.K.''' ,'''You don't have to be a political insider to know that Parliament, along with parts of the Government, has colluded in sabotaging Brexit.''' ,'''One of the things that is great about this country is that we're a meritocracy.

We are a beacon that shines brightly the light of freedom and democracy.''' ,'''Freedom from the E.U. can only be beneficial for our country. We could finally take control of our immigration policies, introduce a fairer system, and keep numbers at a sustainable level that benefits our economy.''' ,'''The ability to control our borders stands at the heart of the debate on whether or not Britain should leave the European Union.''' ,'''The E.U. must see us prepare for life outside of the E.U. without a deal for them to take us seriously.''' ,'''Britain's generosity in the world has allowed us to help the poorest countries to get on the road to industrialisation through economic development and private sector investment in the world's most difficult frontier markets, where jobs and economic opportunities are desperately needed.''' ,'''We can be a free and independent country and will prosper if given a proper chance.''' ,'''Revolutions about taxation have shaped our history.''' ,'''The Withdrawal Agreement - Theresa May's flagship policy, devised and drafted by Brussels, endorsed and supported by the entire Government machine - marks the surrender and capitulation of our country.
