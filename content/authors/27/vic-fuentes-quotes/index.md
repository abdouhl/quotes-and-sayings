- Sometimes I feel like there are just too many things weighing on my mind at once, and I can't control my thoughts or even my body at times.
- I went to Mission Bay High School. Me and my brother, we both went there.
- Equal Vision seems to be doing really well. A lot of these major labels are just imploding and becoming indie labels, anyway.
- When I'm writing, I separate from everyone. Even my band. I push myself, and I'm alone with my thoughts. Separating from friends and comforts and family lets you think a lot deeper about subject matter. Working alone drives me a little crazy, but it makes the writing as honest as possible.
- Growing up in San Diego, I can remember going with my brother to see bands like Pennywise and NOFX - good punk bands that were fast and tight.
- It's all about risk-taking when you're making an album. Don't be scared to do weird things sometimes.
