There's not a lot to be said for that particular lesson.''' ,'''There's a lot of just administrative work that comes along with having employees.''' ,'''One of the powers of a sit-in is its visibility and potential to mobilize public opinion; the way the protest is reported in the media can have a powerful influence over its eventual success or failure.''' ,'''The battle over Napster has divided musicians and industry officials.''' ,'''There's nothing easy about building a company at all.
