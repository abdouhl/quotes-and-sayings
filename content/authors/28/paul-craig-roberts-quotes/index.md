quotes = ['''Governments unaccountable to law are tyrannies, whatever they might call themselves, no matter how exceptional and indispensable they declare themselves to be.''' ,'''The human capital of most macroeconomists, heavily invested in demand management, was wiped out by the policy failures of the 1970s.''' ,'''There are no free financial markets in America or, for that matter, anywhere in the Western word, and few, if any, free markets of any other kind.''' ,'''For a country to be looted, its people's voice must be silenced.''' ,'''Trump has more understanding and insight than his opponents realize. For a man such as Trump to risk acquiring so many powerful enemies and to risk his wealth and reputation, he had to have known that the people's dissatisfaction with the ruling establishment meant he could be elected president.''' ,'''By offshoring the production of their products, U.S. corporations transferred technology, physical plant, and business knowhow to China.''' ,'''The U.S. is ruled by private interest groups and by the neoconservative ideology that history has chosen the U.S. as the 'exceptional and indispensable' country with the right and responsibility to impose its will on the world.''' ,'''As the U.S. is import-dependent, this will translate into higher domestic prices.''' ,'''Beginning with the Clinton Administration and rapidly accelerating with the George W. Bush and Obama regimes and Tony Blair in England, the U.S. and U.K. governments have run roughshod over their accountability to law.''' ,'''We need a memorial day to commemorate the victims of neoliberal globalization.''' ,'''Humans regard animals as worthy of protection only when they are on the verge of extinction.''' ,'''Marxism is a success because it fuses the two inconsistent strains in Western thought - moral skepticism and moral indignation - and makes them complements in the attack against existing society.''' ,'''Marxism is the only doctrine that both satisfies the demands for progress and provides a safe outlet for moral expression in a skeptical age.''' ,'''Because of the failure of the federal government to enforce federal law, we now have 'banks too big to fail,' unregulated Internet monopoly, and the evisceration of a dispersed and independent media.''' ,'''Whether one has a favorable or unfavorable opinion of unions, their demise is also the demise of countervailing power. A system in which there is no countervailing power is a tyranny in which power is unconstrained and unaccountable.''' ,'''A government that cannot survive truth and must resort to stamping out truth is not a government that any country wants.''' ,'''The public subsidies provided to miners, loggers, and ranchers are as extravagant and as harmful to the public interest as the subsidies that the Federal Reserve and Treasury provide to the 'banks too big to fail.'''' ,'''Clearly America is exceptional in its immorality, lack of human compassion, and disrespect for law and its founding document.''' ,'''Clearly what differentiates the U.S. from other countries is the U.S. Constitution. The Constitution defines us as a people. Without the Constitution, we would be a different country. Therefore, to lose the Constitution is to lose the country.''' ,'''War is the only destination to which Washington can lead.''' ,'''The Transatlantic and Transpacific Trade and Investment Partnerships have nothing to do with free trade. 'Free trade' is used as a disguise to hide the power these agreements give to corporations to use lawsuits to overturn sovereign laws of nations that regulate pollution, food safety, GMOs, and minimum wages.''' ,'''The Golden Rule is to 'do unto others as you would have them do unto you.' Allegedly, America is a Christian country. This means that Christian America is following Jesus' Sermon on the Mount in a masochistic way.''' ,'''In 2004, I predicted in a nationally televised conference in Washington, D.C., that the U.S. would be a Third World country in 20 years.''' ,'''Western capitalism is a looting mechanism. It loots labor. It loots the environment, and with the transpacific and transatlantic 'partnerships,' it will loot the sovereign law of countries.''' ,'''Elephants are magnificient creatures.''' ,'''Under Reagan's policies, inflation and nominal GNP growth shriveled much faster than predicted, throwing off government revenue estimates and resulting in budget deficits.''' ,'''Every public institution in the United States and most private ones are corrupt.''' ,'''The financial markets are rigged by the big banks, the Federal Reserve, and the Treasury in the interests of the profits of the few big banks and the dollar's exchange value, which is the basis of U.S. power.''' ,'''The foreign policy of the United States rests entirely on propagandistic lies.''' ,'''Vice is Washington's signature. A fish rots from the head, and Washington has led our country into vice, greed, selfishness, and the mockery and destruction of human life.''' ,'''It is the nature of government and of technology to establish control.''' ,'''The neoconservative ideology supports American financial and military-political imperialism or hegemony.''' ,'''The Federal Trade Commission is supposed to enforce U.S. anti-trust law. Instead, the federal agency routinely violates U.S. anti-trust law by permitting monopoly concentrations of business interests.''' ,'''Corporations and Wall Street in pursuit of short-term profits have given the economy away.''' ,'''When I met with Chinese policymakers in 2006, I advised them that there was a limit to how long they could rely on the U.S. consumer market, as jobs offshoring was destroying it.''' ,'''Representing the people is not something 'our' representatives do. They are too busy representing a handful of private interest groups such as the financial sector, the military/security complex, and agribusiness.''' ,'''I did not think the Oligarchy would allow Trump to win.

However, the American war planners, who elevated U.S. nuclear weapons from a retaliatory role to a pre-emptive first strike function, obviously do not agree that nuclear war cannot be won.''' ,'''I have come to the conclusion that the West is a vast lie machine for the secret agendas of vested interests.''' ,'''The Western media is a Ministry of Truth that operates full-time in support of the artificial existence that Westerners live inside The Matrix where Westerners exist without thought. Considering their inaptitude and inaction, Western peoples might as well not exist.''' ,'''Globalism is a scheme for impoverishing First World labor and taking power and influence from the hands of the many and putting them in the hands of the few.''' ,'''The champions of globalism are the champions of America's destruction.''' ,'''The great problem with corporate capitalism is that publicly owned companies have short time horizons. Unlike a privately owned business, the top executives of a publicly owned corporation generally come to their positions late in life. Consequently, they have a few years in which to make their fortune.''' ,'''If the Obama regime gave a hoot about 'humanitarian crisis,' the Obama regime would not have orchestrated humanitarian crisis in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, and Yemen.''' ,'''The unambigious fact is that U.S. capitalism is a mechanism for looting the many for the benefit of the few.''' ,'''In the Matrix in which Americans live, nothing is ever their fault.''' ,'''Hillary Clinton, an agent for the Oligarchy, was defeated despite the vicious media campaign against Donald Trump.

This neoconservative doctrine puts Russia and China in Washington's crosshairs.''' ,'''The Soviet Union was a partial check on capitalist looting in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.

Marx wrote before offshoring of jobs and the financialization of the economy. Lenin presided over a communist revolution that jumped the gun by taking place in a country in which feudal elements still predominated over capitalism.''' ,'''Putin responds to threats, to illegal sanctions, and to incessant propaganda with statements that governments need to respect each other's national interests and to work together for common benefit.

And then we have hormones and pesticides.''' ,'''Jobs offshoring began with manufacturing, but the rise of the high-speed Internet made it possible to move offshore tradable professional skills, such as software engineering, information technology, various forms of engineering, architecture, accounting, and even the medical reading of MRIs and CT-Scans.''' ,'''The planet is being polluted with many forms of wastes.''' ,'''People everywhere face the threat of control by government and technology.''' ,'''When America's Newspaper of Record is nothing but a propaganda ministry, what is America?''' ,'''I have argued that the Soviet story is one of the interaction of speculative excess or utopian aspirations with refractory reality.''' ,'''There is no independent American print or TV media.''' ,'''The government, of course, will print money to bail out the banks' uncovered casino bets, but not to bail out the elderly from the theft of their funds.''' ,'''When I was a young man, an individual with one million dollars was very rich. Anyone with a few millions more was considered richer than rich.''' ,'''Progressives regard government as the white knight that protects the public from the greed of capitalists. If only.''' ,'''In the United States, journalists receive awards for lying for the government and for the corporations.''' ,'''Once a country descends into evil, it doesn't emerge.''' ,'''Capitalists make money by exploiting labor and by externalizing the costs of the wastes produced by the productive process by imposing the wastes on the environment.''' ,'''Peace is costly to the profits of the military/security complex. Washington's gigantic military and security interests are far more powerful than the peace lobby.''' ,'''Everyone who ever trusted Washington has been betrayed.
