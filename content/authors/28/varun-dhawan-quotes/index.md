So, I was very happy to voice it.
- The translation of social media buzz does not really happen. Films do well through word of mouth.

- My dad has always been vocal about critically appreciating me. If I have done a bad job, he will definitely try to correct me with his inputs.

- My brother starting earning early in life. I stopped taking money from my parents, and my brother would give me the pocket money.
- Social media makes you think.
- I don't think you need a particular day to dedicate to your dad or to make your father or parents feel special. A child should make his or her parents feel special every day and vice versa.

- My dream role would be a role that is entertaining and 'massy,' and it should be able to make people laugh and cry and make the audience scared of me and then make them fall in love with me again.

- My parents brought me up to be comfortable in one's own body. And I have always been comfortable in my own skin.
