- I do not have a family, per se. When I was younger, I grew up in foster care with my brother and sister. It was really a struggle, and knowing that there were people out there with tight-knit families really made my childhood an unfortunate one.
- Later in life, when I'm retired and have a family of my own and will be able to send my kids to college, that's when I'll start spending. Way too many athletes go broke these days, and I like saving my money so that I can ensure my family and friends currently and after me will never have to endure some of the things I did when I was a kid.
- When you're growing up, it's always nice to have someone you can relate and look up to. I'm proud of how I conduct my business and how I have accomplished all that I have accomplished, and hope that I can be a positive influence on not only the Mexican community but also young boxers and people all around the world.
- I've always been seen as the underdog in everything I've ever done in my life, and it doesn't bother me in the slightest. The lessons have just made me stronger.
- I appreciate everything that has been done for me. After a difficult start, I've just followed my dreams.
- I am very proud of the fact that I get to go out there every day and train in order to represent the Mexican people, and I can only hope they look up to me in a similar fashion.
