- With us, people caught on to something on our third album, and that will never be repeated. Basically, I don't really have any complaints about the way that Beach House has grown. I feel like we're still in control of what we're doing, and it's a great time in our existence.
- I don't like to read the Internet; I'm not aware of what's going on.
- I think the voice is an underrated instrument these days and it's easy to make up for lack of ability with effects. I think sometimes people are more wowed with effects than core craftsmanship. Strong voices are not as common as they used to be.
- As you get older you realise that nothing lasts forever. It's not depressing, but it does make moments more intense.
- Yeah, it's a lot harder to find a musical partner than a love partner.
- I wouldn't mind doing a soundtrack someday.
- I like to find the beauty in the ugly. When I'm in a thrift store, I gravitate toward pieces I know I'll wear a ton, and insane pieces that I'm sure most people would consider gross. But I find them inspiring. Our van is currently stocked with some of my random findings from this tour. Maybe I'll call my aesthetic 'van fashion.'
- But I love the hot sweat. I think overheating onstage is invigorating. It's better than being comfortable. I think being comfortable is the death of a show.
- It's always about trying to make everything go with the music, like a script. It's not like, 'Let's have a confetti gun!' If I ever have one of those, it will be because it's absolutely the right thing at the moment in the song. I can't just go get a confetti gun.
- I don't think my vocals demand effects. I like reverb to a certain extent, but I don't want to hide my voice. I like stripped-down vocals, but I also like crazy, powerful, doubled vocals like in dance or electronic music.
- I don't wear dresses and flowers in my hair and float around!
- We feel more and more intensely about the music we make. It's unexpected, and not always what you would think of in Beach House. It's all art in the end. We aren't making records because we have to; it's because it's what we want to express.
- My hair is a wild, untamable beast! I like letting it grow; my bangs grow whatever way they want and I kind of follow their rule. So side bangs, poof bangs - it's kind of unpredictable.
- Sometimes people talk about music, whether blogs or magazines, in a strange way where it doesn't seem like they're actually listening to it.
- As long as artists can make something, artists will continue to survive.
- I personally do not listen to a lot of music. It helps keep my mind free. I don't want to sound like someone else from the get-go. I want to express myself and the world in my head.
- For me, it's really day to day. I don't really plan ahead and I like to be excited about what I'm wearing. Being on the road all the time, it's various articles of clothing that keep me inspired and feeling good. A fun or beautiful thing to wear can change your day. I think spontaneity and not adhering to any narrow styles keep me happy.
- Obviously, it's great to know that your music is being listened to.
