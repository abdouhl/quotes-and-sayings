quotes = ['''I think 'Trial & Retribution' as a brand can go on forever. Its joy is that it has, to an extent, a formula, which gives a comfort routine for viewers. But we allow our directors total autarchy in putting their personalities on their stories.''' ,'''As an actress, the joy of being able to play the three sides of any woman, which are the glamour, the pragmatic and the one not to be messed with, is pretty glorious.''' ,'''If you're Irish, it doesn't matter where you go - you'll find family.''' ,'''The idea of Jonathan Rhys Meyers as Dracula, all I could think of was, why haven't they done this with him before?
