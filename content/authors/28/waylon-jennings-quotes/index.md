- But ya know what, I am a part of something that happened. I'm a part of the music that happened. My voice is one more instrument, is what it is. So that's the way I feel about people who play on sessions.
- I may be crazy, but it keeps me from going insane.
- You know, in the days when I started, if you had Chet Atkins' name on your record as a producer and it was on RCA, you could work the road. It didn't have to be a big hit record, it just had to have that on it.
- Cuz I was never pretty anyway and never cared anything about that.
- Chet loved artists. He did. But he was caught up in the system. He had two hats. He had to have 'em because he did two things: he was an artist, and he was an executive.

- I never have any problem getting enthusiastic with a good song and a good band.
- Don't ever try and be like anybody else and don't be afraid to take risks.
- But Buddy was an upper. He was happy. He loved music, and he was really happy. I don't know... I don't believe in reincarnation at all, but if all that stuff is true, then he might have been on his last time around.
- One thing is that I wasn't getting booked that well, and they had control over who got the awards, they had control over who sold. And they really did not want Willie or me, either one, to have a hit record. They wanted the money, but they didn't want us to be the ones.
- But you know, the system almost destroyed itself while it was goin' on trying to destroy us.
- Finally, my manager negotiated a deal where I got to produce my own records.
- I was king of the mountain for a long time, well, I don't want that no more. I like to perform every once in a while for people who want to see me, and cut albums of music that is what I'm really about.
- You know, I feel sorry for the young artists.
- So I'm not very popular here with those inside the system, as you might guess. I never wanted to be.

- I love Johnny Cash, and I respect Johnny Cash. He's the biggest. He's like an Elvis in this business, but no, he's never been the rebel.
- We did an album one time called White Mansions, about the civil war, but it was written by a guy from England. His looking at it from over there and it not being a part of his history made it so he could be objective.
- A lot of times they don't want to hear it. But you know, if some good is done to you, you should pass it on.
