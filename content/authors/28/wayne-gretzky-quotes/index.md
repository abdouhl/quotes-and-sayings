- Hockey is a unique sport in the sense that you need each and every guy helping each other and pulling in the same direction to be successful.
- The only way a kid is going to practice is if it's total fun for him... and it was for me.
- I think that from the time you start playing sports as a child you see that your responsibility to your team is to play the best that you can play as an individual... and yet, not take anything away from being part of a team.
- By no means could I play at the level of these kids who play in the NHL now but as 50-year-olds go, I feel really good and I feel blessed that I'm still healthy.
- I skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been.
- Ninety percent of hockey is mental and the other half is physical.
- The highest compliment that you can pay me is to say that I work hard every day, that I never dog it.
- Listen, everything I have in my life is because of the NHL and because of hockey, and I love the game and I loved every minute of being a player, I loved coaching, I loved being involved in the NHL.
- And people who know me would tell you that away from hockey I'm really not that competitive.
- I get a feeling about where a teammate is going to be. A lot of times, I can turn and pass without even looking.
- A good hockey player plays where the puck is. A great hockey player plays where the puck is going to be.
- When I was 5 and playing against 11-year-olds, who were bigger, stronger, faster, I just had to figure out a way to play with them.
- It's an honour and a thrill and a privilege just to play in the NHL.
- Procrastination is one of the most common and deadliest of diseases and its toll on success and happiness is heavy.
- Growing up, I was always the small guy.
- I'm very proud of our NHL players. I think they all handle themselves extremely well and they all work really hard.
- You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.
- I couldn't beat people with my strength; I don't have a hard shot; I'm not the quickest skater in the league. My eyes and my mind have to do most of the work.
- My kids are no different than anyone else's - they tend to disagree with everything I say!
- Look at guys like Larry Bird and George Brett and John McEnroe; that's what they did in their careers. They all wanted to be the guy under the microscope late in the game or late in the match. So you just take on that know-how that that's part of your responsibility, and you learn that's what makes it exciting. That's what makes it fun!
- I just like to keep my money in the bank; I'm not a big risk-taker. I don't know anything about the stock market... I stay away from things I don't know anything about.
- Most people marry their mother. I married my father.
- I knew at a young age, whether I was playing baseball or hockey or lacrosse, that my teammates were counting on me, whether it be to strike the last batter out in a baseball game or score a big goal in a hockey game.
- I wasn't naturally gifted in terms of size and speed; everything I did in hockey I worked for, and that's the way I'll be as a coach.
- I don't like my hockey sticks touching other sticks, and I don't like them crossing one another, and I kind of have them hidden in the corner. I put baby powder on the ends. I think it's essentially a matter of taking care of what takes care of you.
- The biggest difference between L.A. and Edmonton was that instead of people looking at me I was looking at them.
