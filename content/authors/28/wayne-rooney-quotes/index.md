- Just to confirm to all my followers I have had a hair transplant. I was going bald at 25 why not.
- I love football, football is my life.
- Football's about the young players, bringing youth team players through to the first team and hopefully getting the best out of them so they can go on to play for their country.
- Becoming a dad means you have to be a role model for your son and be someone he can look up to.
- I want to score in every game and win things. That's the most important thing.
- When I was about 16, I got my ball taken off me by the police for playing in the street - which is pathetic really.
- Early on in my career I had a lot of bad press about my temperament, but I was only a young lad then.
- If you don't score, and you have chances, you are disappointed.
- I don't think I look up to any players. Obviously you respect everyone.
- Pulling on your country's shirt is the greatest honour a footballer can have. It's what I always dreamed of as a kid and I get a buzz every time.
- Part of my preparation is I go and ask the kit man what colour we're wearing - if it's red top, white shorts, white socks or black socks. Then I lie in bed the night before the game and visualise myself scoring goals or doing well.
- The important thing is to be there, score when needed. It's better if the goals are beautiful, better still if they are important.
- I'm proud I'm English and I'm passionate about my country.
- You just want to keep playing consistently now and keep working hard and I'm sure the goals will come.
- When famous people come up to you it's a bit weird, but it's an honour, really, when they recognise you and want to chat to you for a bit.
- I'm only a human being.
- I've matured since joining United, on and off the field.
- I've trained all my life. I've always been one who enjoys training so it's not something that I think I can just stop doing. It might not be as regular but I want to keep training.
- There's a lot more pressure on me at United. There are people out there trying to shoot you down.
- You can learn more from the lows than the highs. The highs are great but the lows make you really look at things in a different way and want to improve. Every player will have both in their careers and I have, but what you get is that experience which is so important to perform at your best.
- Some players don't like training and I've seen some players who aren't bothered if they play or not. But I want to play every game. Sometimes you have to rest in certain games, but I want to play in every game.
- I'm just a normal young lad who plays football.
- If you're not scoring the frustrations build up.
- I might have faults but I'm not a big head.
- If you look at my bookings, they've gone down each season. That's something I'm trying to keep improving. On the pitch you don't want any silly bookings.
- I don't normally cook, but if I did it probably would be beans, sausage, bacon and eggs. I never really get to eat that to be honest.
- I like musicals and I love music.
- Those who said I'm not an out-and-out goal-scorer are probably right. I always feel I could score more.
- I think the fans are going to expect a lot from me, as they should.
- If I'm staying in a hotel or I'm sleeping on my own I have the hairdryer on.
- You're trying to put yourself in that moment and trying to prepare yourself, to have a 'memory before the game. I don't know if you'd call it visualising or dreaming, but I've always done it, my whole life.
- I am mentally strong.
- It's strange but I suppose I'm one of those senior players now and I'll be helping the young players as much as I can.
- Diving has been in the game for years. Probably the coverage the game gets now, with all the cameras around, it gets highlighted a bit more. But it hasn't got any worse.
- If we're on long-haul flights I've been known to sleep on the floor so I hear the engine.
- I love Barbados, it's really relaxing.
- I've learnt that it is important not to go over the top with aggression, because then either you are going to miss a lot of games, or you are not going to be concentrating on the game you are playing.
- I just hate losing and that gives you an extra determination to work harder.
- Unlike others who have been caught swearing on camera, I apologised immediately. And yet I am the only person banned for swearing. That doesn't seem right.
- The lifestyle I lead as a footballer means I am always in the spotlight.
- I've started doing my coaching badges, I'd like to be a manager one day.
- I love football, I've never really taken an interest in anything else.
- I play the game as honestly as I can. If the referee gives a penalty there is nothing you can do.
- When I was younger, I used to visualise myself scoring wonder goals, stuff like that.
- Perfect partners don't exist. Perfect conditions exist for a limited time in which partnerships express themselves best.

- Everyone who watches me play knows I am an honest player.
- When they talk to me, people say, 'I didn't expect you to be how you are.'
- Nice to see your home fans boo you. That's what loyal support is.
- Football is made up of all kinds of conflict. In a dressing room, between players, between us and the manager, between us and loads of people who don't seem to matter. It's constant and harsh sometimes.
- I am as passionate about the England team as anyone.
- I train as hard as I can every time I train and I do extra training every day and I've done that since I was a young boy.
- As you get older you play in more important games and that is when you start thinking about what will happen if you win or lose.
- There are many ways to grow football-wise. You go slow or are pushed to go faster, otherwise you get left behind. For me, there would be trouble in stopping learning.
- When you are 16 there is no fear whatsoever. As you get older you play in more important games and that is when you start thinking about what will happen if you win or lose.
- Growing up, watching the Premier League as far back as I can remember, feeling the trophy and having the medal around my neck was an unbelievable feeling.
- I love football so when I finish playing I would like to still be involved in it somehow and a manager would be my first choice.
- I'm not really that bothered by appearance. I know a few players who go off doing stuff in the mirror ages before they go out to play a game, but I'm not really interested in that.
- Sometimes you have to rest in certain games, but I want to play in every game.
