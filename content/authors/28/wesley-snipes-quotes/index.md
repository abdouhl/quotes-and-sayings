- If a woman decides she likes me, it would behoove her to take into consideration that my art has had a strong influence on the type of person I am.
- I think I have kind of a natural magnetism.
- There is a bit of arrogance with 'Hollywood' types that doesn't sit well with game developers.
- There are so few guys who do action and do it well. Even fewer who are African-American. Even fewer who have classical-theater training. So a cat like me coming in, I'm bringing all of that to an action movie.
- I like science fiction and physics, things like that. Planets being sucked into black holes, and the various vortexes that create possibility, and what happens on the other side of the black hole. To me it's the microcosmic study of the macrocosmic universe in man, and that's why I'm attracted to it.
- I'm not looking at an action movie as something where I just jump around and look beautiful and show my muscles. Since there are so few people that do this and have that pedigree, people disregard their contribution.
- I think of myself as a young prince from a long line of royalty.
- We're conditioned in this country to believe that if there's a problem, the black man is usually the culprit.
- I've reduced a lot of the stress in my life. I've gotten rid of a lot of things. The light was turned on and a lot of the cockroaches started spinning. I swept them out the door. And sometimes you just have to throw things out because they carry a certain energy.
- I think any man would be nervous if his liberty is at stake.

- Certain roles are more challenging than others, but I haven't come across one yet that I can't tackle.
- We should be able to go to our government and get clear answers.
- No one can train you to be famous. How do you deal with the loss of anonymity, the loss of privacy? You have to be disciplined.
- Personally I find there is just as much if not more creativity among game makers as there is among feature filmmakers.
- Internationally, I have as large of a fan base - if not larger - than I have domestically.
- I had acne late, in college. My skin used to be really flawless. Went to college, became a vegetarian, ate a lot of cheese - big mistake. Here I am trying to be healthy and I'm eating grilled cheese sandwiches and french fries every day, having mad eruptions all over my face.
- I didn't go into this business to do action because I'm a classically trained actor. But I'm good at kicking and punching.
- I'm a physical type of actor and love projects in which I can get physical. The more action, the better.
- I used to do puppet theatre and also mime and musical theatre in Florida for competitions and festivals, which was great. I was very much involved in theatre when I was in college.
- My sign is Leo. A Leo has to walk with pride. When he takes a step, he has to put his foot down. You walk into a room and you want people to know your presence, without you doing anything.
- I've come to the conclusion that beautiful women in the West aren't comfortable finding strength in their femininity. They want to do masculine-oriented things to establish their femininity. It's a contradiction.

- My mother was pretty much on my case all the time.
- I was never charged with tax evasion. I've never been a tax protester.
- I'm proud to be an American. I'm proud to be an African American in America. I've had some interesting experiences: some great, some not so great, but I love it here.
- I've always been paying my taxes and I've always been trying to comply.
- Well, I'm an artist to the core. And my objective has always been to use my talents and my skills to elevate humanity through my art.
- I come out of repertory theatre so I've been working under pressure my whole career.
- I've been trying to keep the private life private. Not being savvy or trained on how to do good interviews like a politician, I thought it was wiser to follow my mother's advice: If you have nothing good to say, don't say anything at all.

- I have a whole other side that has yet to be seen on screen.
