quotes = ['''Once, no self-respecting puncher considered himself dressed for work until he had his feet inside of a pair of $15 boots made by one of the favorite boot-makers, whose merits they discussed about the camp fires night after night.''' ,'''Man's greed to obtain something for nothing has never yet been able to content itself with a moderate profit.''' ,'''Every author believes that the book which he is placing before the public will 'fill a long-felt want,' and success or failure depends very much on how closely he has been able to gauge the nature of the 'long-felt want.'''' ,''''Mustanging' was like trout fishing.
