- The trouble with being poor is that it takes up all your time.
- Style is a fraud. I always felt the Greeks were hiding behind their columns.
- I make pictures and someone comes in and calls it art.
- The attitude that nature is chaotic and that the artist puts order into it is a very absurd point of view, I think. All that we can hope for is to put some order into ourselves.
- An artist is forced by others to paint out of his own free will.
- My interest in desperation lies only in that sometimes I find myself having become desperate. Very seldom do I start out that way. I can see of course that, in the abstract, thinking and all activity is rather desperate.
- Art never seems to make me peaceful or pure.
