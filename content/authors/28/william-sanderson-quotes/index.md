- It's hard to watch something you've done many years ago.
- I've said maybe too many times that I'd rather be typecast than not cast at all.
- I'm a journeyman actor, and I don't ever want to forget that. With romantic-lead dreams.
- The only consistent hobby I've had is studying Spanish and French because of some delusion of grandeur to work around the world. I love sports but usually I'm looking for the next job.
- One of the joys about acting is researching.
- My first western was 'Death Hunt' with Charles Bronson and Lee Marvin; that was where I learned to ride. The movie was based on a true story about a guy that eluded the Mounties in Canada. We were in Canada for six weeks riding horses.
- I kinda like where I am. If I'm recognized all the time, I have to leave better tips in restaurants.
- In Montana, when we did 'Return to Lonesome Dove', we rode on the side of a hill at night in the dark; I was afraid my horse would step on one of the actors playing dead. The director said to leave it to the stunt doubles since they got paid for that.
- One night I saw Jerry Lee, Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins, and Elvis for a dollar, if you believe that, in an open-air concert. Presley, I got to meet and go into his house and so forth. My wife says I should quit tellin' that story, 'cause they'll know how old I am.
- It's easier to play quirky characters and hide behind wardrobe and make-up, especially.
- I love the word 'resonance.'
- As a youngster, I had friends who became lawyers and doctors, and I was as idealistic as anybody. When I was in the Army, I read a book by Adlai Stevenson. He said law was as noble as saving a person's life. So at one point, I felt that way, too. But after a while, I said, 'Let me just finish the degree. I'm getting the G.I. Bill.'
- You can't go over every beat, every second, and worry about how you can do it better - it'll eat you alive.
- I've been kinda fascinated by misfits, outcasts, and downtrodden people. I've identified with them. 'Blade Runner' probably got me more work than any. It convinced some producers that I could play something other than a rural crazy, I guess.
- I'm not known for my intellectual range and tricks have been played on me.
- Someone once said that Sci Fi was the modern Western. What's my favorite? Well, anything that needs a misfit. I don't have a real favorite. My dream is to play something different.
- The best came from my martial arts teacher, who also taught Elvis. He said, 'Your ego will get you killed.'
- I hope to outlive my enemies.
- When I was in the Army, I read a book by Adlai Stevenson. He said law was as noble as saving a person's life. So at one point, I felt that way too.
- When you play so many outcasts and derelicts, or even a murderer, you need to play someone healthy.
- I'm probably the most pessimistic actor I know. I'm always sure I'll never work again.
- I consider it probably one of the biggest honors to be in the Academy. There are only like 1300 actors in it, and as far as I know, you're a member for life. To this day, I'm wondering how lucky I was.
- Once I was in my last year of law school, I started doing plays, as I said, without taking the bar. And I got hooked. I did a play called 'Marat/Sade', and I never had so much fun in my life.
- 'Newhart' ran the longest, and it was great to have a regular role, but I run into a lot of film fans, and they ask me about 'Blade Runner.' I was grateful to be a part of that.
- I like Edward G. Robinson - he started as a character actor and became a lead, which is probably why I like him.
