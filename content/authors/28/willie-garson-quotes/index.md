- 'Sex and The City' had very strong gag orders as to what we could say and not say.
- TV deals in very broad strokes. Like, 'Oh, that's my dumb friend', or, 'That's my funny friend.' A true best friend, a sidekick, has to be a little deeper then that. You have to feel like there's nothing either character won't do. That someone really, really has their back.
- Not everyone looks like Brad Pitt. There are people in the world that look like me. I think people feel that I could be living next door to them. That has much more effect on me.
- I am starting to explore directing, maybe in the future in the world of 'White Collar.'
