- I would recommend getting married young. That way you don't have all the baggage.
- I cut a rap song once. It was a few years ago for my old show 'Buck Commander,' and it was a song called 'You're Short.' It was about my camera guy. We shot the video in Las Vegas, 'Ocean's Eleven' style!
- Making duck calls is the hardest thing that we make, so there's skill involved, and they're all handmade.
- I think my father had a lot of anti-establishment in him. He came through the '60s.
- Phil has the classic, mature beard. Jase's is kind of red - it's weird, like him! Jep grooms his the most: He's got all these special lotions and perfumes that he puts on.
- Sometimes in the heart of the summer, I look at people with their faces shaved and think it'd be nice, but once you get used to it, it's not as hot. Most guys say it gets itchy, but once you grow it out into a big man beard, the itching is gone.
- I think Dad didn't really treat us like children; he treated us more like little adults. We were good kids.
- We've been in business together ever since we were children, so back in the day, there were so many references to 'your dad.' Rather than wanting to sound totally hickified and go, 'Well, my daddy said,' we would refer to him as 'Phil.'
- The original purpose of the beards was to help with the wind when it's blowing in your face. When you're out there in the woods hunting like we are all the time, we found that facial hair helps you to stay a lot warmer.
- Si's beard is really awkward. One side is longer than the other, and it's about three different colors. I don't think he washes it. It's nasty.
- You don't set off in life to be mediocre. At least, I don't.
