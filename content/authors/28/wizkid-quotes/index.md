- If you're coming to do an interview with me, you should know about me. It's not that it's 'cos I'm Wizkid; I'd even hate it if you were coming to interview my friend and asked him the same question. You're here for an interview, so you should know who you're doing the interview with.
- I'm getting in the studio with everybody I've always wanted to work with. That's the amazing thing.
- I like me some Bape, you know. But I wear anything, to be honest. Adyn, Rick Owens, Givenchy, anything. I shop from everywhere.
- I knew 'Ojuelegba' was a good song, but I didn't expect it to blow up the way that it did.
- We still have a lot of work to do as African artists to get more recognition in the U.K. and the U.S., but right now, definitely, we're getting the recognition. The thing is we have to earn it. Keep working. Stay working.
- Lagos style is fresh and different. Even with the tailors, they get very innovative with their stuff, with the cuts. When my parents used to make the traditional wares, it was a little bit baggy. But now the tailors are able to infuse the European style, making it slim-fit. Lagos style is different, man. Innovative.
- It's not like a boss and artist relationship; it's like a big brother to a younger brother relationship, and he's a great guy. So big shout-out to Akon and the Konvict Muzik crowd.
- It's crazy how a whole lot of African artists work. Big respect to everyone that does it, but I have not heard anything that really cuts across. We're trying to do that.
- I didn't have accessories when I started my career. Did you see me wearing bling-bling when I did 'Hola at Your Boi?' No! I hustled to get money to buy them, and there is no crime if I show it or flaunt it to my fans because they gave me money to buy them.
- I'm still trying to keep it original, staying true to my sound.
- Music is everything to me, and I'm most grateful that it's all working out.
- Whenever I make music, I just make it depending on however I feel at that moment and what I'm getting inspiration from, so it depends - whatever, it's just my mood.
- When I'm back home, all I wear is African fabric. All I really rock is the traditional stuff.
- No, fame has not changed Wizkid.
- Whatever happens on tour... stays on tour!
- I'm thankful because all the hard work and sacrifices were worth it in the end.
- Umm... my favourite Wizkid tune of all time would be 'Don't Dull' 'cos I recorded the track in, like, 5 minutes. The beat was ready, we went into the studio and freestyled, and it was ready. The song became really, really big, so I think 'Don't Dull' is still my favourite.
- The only thing fame has changed in Wizkid is that I added some accessories. I have got nice chains, watches, and nice clothes. Asides that, I am still Wizkid. I no tall, still same height.
- I have a lot of tailors. If I want something made in 12 hours, it will be made in 12 hours.
- I always dreamed of making it big.
