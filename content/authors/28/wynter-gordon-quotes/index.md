- My favorite song is called 'Reachout.' There are so many different stories told in that song. I think anyone who listens to it will gather a different meaning, but each answer is true. I also like the sound of it, period - there are a lot of classical influences.
- On stage, I need to be seen from the back seats. So, I dress more colorful and vibrant.
- I've been working in the music industry since I was 15 years old, and I feel like I've always been ahead of my time.
- When I first started, the very first body of music I made when I got signed to Atlantic were songs with titles like 'Unify' and 'You're Special.' And there's this song that reminds me of Meghan Trainor that I wrote, about a woman's body and not conforming, when I first started in music.
- 'Stimela' is the very first video I directed. I wanted it to be an emotional visual art piece, displaying humans as free, powerful animals. We are all running from something or searching for something; our instincts have been ignored.
- When we talk about my music, it's a cross between Tina Turner, Alanis Morrisette, and Diana Ross. It's the glamour and the showiness of Diana Ross; the ferociousness and pain of Tina Turner; and the vocals of Alanis.
- I would love to design my own shoe line. Women suffer too much in heels. I want to design a line of sexy platform heels that don't hurt.
- My style is cinematic; it is a touch of French woman of the '60s and American hippie with a Brooklyn edge. I love wearing wide-brim hats, newsboy caps, mini dresses and sheer blouses with details.
- I always considered myself a performer. It's what God gave me. It doesn't matter if one person hears it or a million.
- I'm not too big on accessories, but I love my basic black quartz watch from American Apparel. It's a simple piece that goes with my vintage, thrift store chic style.
- I can't live without my silver Marc Jacobs boots! They are a little bit cowboy, a little bit space alien. They go with everything.
- I grew up in South Jamaica, Queens, in New York. My parents were very religious churchgoing people. They were very strict. I was never really allowed to indulge in anything vain. Modesty always. I have three brothers and two sisters, so everything was on a budget.
- 'The Human Condition' is me exploring some ideas and thoughts that I have that don't fit one sound. I'm giving emotions a sound - it's a fusion of genres. There are four EPs in 'The Human Condition'; each title is a different emotion.
- My style is a mashup of different eras, but each piece I have makes me feel good about myself. I do have a taste for expensive shoes.
- I toured with Skrillex, did an HBO commercial with Diplo. In the hip hop movement, I was the first artist Travis Scott ever featured with before he blew up. I had the songs with Chris Brown and Tyga. I've worked with some of the biggest artists in the world.
- There's beauty in pain, and everyone experiences it - and it's a lesson.
- What I love about Sade other than her smooth and sultry voice is her willingness to be vulnerable. As a powerful, strong and beautiful woman of color, she showed her delicate, passionate side in a world where most of us are putting on a brave face. I love how effortless her style was and how consistent that red lip was!
- I read fantasy books like the Harry Potter books, 'Twilight,' also biographies, and I like to read about people who have been through stuff like wars or lost their families - real life stuff, you know? I like to read about their experiences and how they coped with that.
- I'd like to work with Florence and The Machine, Little Dragon, Frank Ocean, Miguel, Calvin Harris... there are so many artists and producers.
- Making dance music was one of the best things I did in my life. I traveled the world; I met the most amazing fans. I got a lot of respect from doing it.
- A lot of artists get famous overseas first. I don't know what it is here. I have a large underground following in the U.S., but I don't get the airplay as much as I do in, say, Australia. Over there, they can play whatever they like, it seems, but not so much here.
- I bought my Grasshoppers tennis shoes at a flea market in Brooklyn. They are so comfortable to lounge around in on tour.
