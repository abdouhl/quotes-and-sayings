- My parents set a fantastic example for me in that their passion came from theater.
- I can't deny that there's a great privilege in having parents who are established in the field that I'm pursuing. I try to appreciate the fact that they're so great at it. They've been such great role models, not only talent-wise but also in how they lead their lives and the reasons why they've pursued this.
- Being an actor, I never think I'm going to get the part. It's always a thrill when things go the way you hope they will.
- The 'Roseanne' set was totally my home away from home. And I did pal around and roller-skate with Dakota Johnson. And now she's a megastar!
- I hold my parents in such high esteem for what they do, so that, in and of itself, is a very lucky position to be in.
- When you talk to people in retrospect, they always say the casting was a no-brainer, but nothing really is. You have to have so many things line up. I'm very grateful that it worked out.
- I was interested in watching it; I wasn't interested necessarily in performing. So I'm grateful to kind of find that passion myself, as an adult, because it was really mentally strenuous, and I don't think I would have been mentally equipped for it, honestly.
- My approach is literally what is being told in the scene. I try to be as real as possible, and I try to find my own truth in it and figure out how to best serve each character.
- I don't discount the privilege that comes with being the kid of two very great actors. All I can say is I'm very grateful that I've had their examples. And it's fun to get to share it with them.
- We all have opinions to what our parents really are, whether they agree or not. I'm sure they would feel the same the other way around.
- I learned that if you can proceed with a level of anonymity while still pursuing the thing you love, that's the dream.
- When I was younger, I was living in that green room and accompanying them to all the different theaters that they worked at. So, that has always remained a nostalgic place for me and also one of great admiration. I was just so grateful that that passion they have for theater translated to me, because I always loved seeing it.
- What we recall as children is a version of what's happening around us.
- Along with being around the 'Roseanne' stuff, I've been following my mom and my dad back to Steppenwolf.
- You're always striving to get better, and I would get in my own way sometimes or stop myself if I felt it wasn't as good as it should be. You're going to fall on your face a couple of times, and the lesson is to get back up.
- A great benefit of having parents in the same profession is if I do have a terrible audition story, I can call them up, and we can laugh about it because they get it. That's always been a great therapeutic outlet.
- When I was younger, I found it incredibly intimidating to audition for anything. As I've gotten older and had more experience and gained more confidence in myself, I'm able to quiet some of those demons a little more successfully.
- When I first started pursuing acting professionally out of college, it was very much in my head that there would be comparisons with potentially both of my parents, and I found that pretty intimidating.
- I got to see my mom do 'Long Day's Journey' in London, which was really beautiful.
- Oh, yeah! Playing 'Young Jackie' came at the insistence of Roseanne herself. Mom obliged but told me that would not be an option again until I was 18. Truthfully, I grew up not thinking I would act.
- It's incredible to be going from the Shondaland universe to 'Big Bang' creator Chuck Lorre.
- When I'm acting, there are moments where I'm thinking, 'I sound like my mom when I say that,' or, 'I sound like my dad when I say that.'
- I can only do what I do, and if people respond to it, great, and if they don't, that's what that is.
