The public has an interest only in judgments.''' ,'''Of all the ways of acquiring books, writing them oneself is regarded as the most praiseworthy method. Writers are really people who write books not because they are poor, but because they are dissatisfied with the books which they could buy but do not like.''' ,'''The construction of life is at present in the power of facts far more than convictions.''' ,'''Memory is not an instrument for exploring the past but its theatre.

The slogans of an inadequate criticism peddle ideas to fashion.''' ,'''All disgust is originally disgust at touching.''' ,'''Gifts must affect the receiver to the point of shock.''' ,'''It is precisely the purpose of the public opinion generated by the press to make the public incapable of judging, to insinuate into it the attitude of someone irresponsible, uninformed.''' ,'''Work on good prose has three steps: a musical stage when it is composed, an architectonic one when it is built, and a textile one when it is woven.''' ,'''The greater the decrease in the social significance of an art form, the sharper the distinction between criticism and enjoyment by the public. The conventional is uncritically enjoyed, and the truly new is criticized with aversion.''' ,'''The art of storytelling is reaching its end because the epic side of truth, wisdom, is dying out.''' ,'''Opinions are to the vast apparatus of social existence what oil is to machines: one does not go up to a turbine and pour machine oil over it; one applies a little to hidden spindles and joints that one has to know.''' ,'''To be happy is to be able to become aware of oneself without fright.''' ,'''Counsel woven into the fabric of real life is wisdom.''' ,'''Death is the sanction of everything the story-teller can tell. He has borrowed his authority from death.''' ,]
