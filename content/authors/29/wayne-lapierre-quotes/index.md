It is your place to stand and fight with Americans just like you, for all that is good and right.''' ,'''With all the foreign aid the United State does... can't we afford to put a police officer in every single school?''' ,'''Our individual liberty is the very essence of America. It is what makes America unique.''' ,'''To stop a bad guy with a gun, it takes a good guy with a gun.''' ,'''We must keep the pressure on Congress to curb Obama's continued abuse of power. We must always expose that abuse to fellow citizens.''' ,'''For Obama, 'rule of law' is merely his political silly-putty.''' ,'''The U.N.'s driving mission is to accumulate power at the expense of the sovereignity of individual nations and fundamental individual rights, and its gun-ban treaty proves it.''' ,'''Our nation's founding fathers carefully crafted a Bill of Rights - an articulation of personal liberties woven into the entire fabric of our free society. When any of those freedoms are threatened anywhere, they must be defended and protected everywhere.''' ,'''Holder's Justice Department is not the shield of justice, it has become the shield for Obama's political transgressions.''' ,'''People have become so weary of all the government and media dishonesty, the all-too-commonplace lying, that most Americans have stopped listening.''' ,'''Change' - Obama's election mantra - is a direct, in-your-face affront to the very vision of our Founding Fathers.''' ,'''When you hear politicians who won't fix the broken system talk about expanding it, don't buy it.''' ,'''The ultimate goal of the gun ban 'scientific community' is to make the 'gun ownership is a disease' mantra into politically settled science.''' ,'''What Bloomberg and his elitist cronies will never understand is what saves the Second Amendment is the tidal wave of support from the majority of the American people. And decade after decade, NRA has been their voice.''' ,'''Obama means to erase the Second Amendment by any means possible.''' ,'''Only in the Orwellian world of double-speak employed by President Barack Obama and billionaire elitist Michael Bloomberg would nonsense be hailed as 'common sense.'''' ,'''In truth, the legacy that President Obama's agenda will leave on history is the poisoning of the tree of liberty.''' ,'''Once they ban rifles, they're gone forever.''' ,'''Parents all over the country are using their right to keep and bear arms to protect their kids.''' ,'''People want to be able to protect themselves.''' ,'''The media's intentional corruption of the truth is an abomination and NRA members will never - and I mean never - submit or surrender to the national media!''' ,'''Our fight isn't just about the Second Amendment, it's about preserving all our liberties - saving our constitutional heritage and protections for the future.''' ,'''Through your individual leadership, millions of gun owners across the nation made their voices heard sending an unmistakable message: stop President Barack Obama's destruction of our liberty and restore our Constitution.''' ,'''Knowing who you are and what guns you own was indeed the key to the massive gun theft by government in Australia that saw hundreds of thousands of honest, law-abiding citizens disarmed.''' ,'''If the U.S. refused to take part in the U.N.'s international gun registry, other nations could potentially ban their domestic firearm manufacturers from exporting firearms to the United States.''' ,'''Not enough people really think about the founding of our country, how it all began and what its really about. They don't even teach it in schools any more.''' ,'''We are the millions and millions of Americans who take responsibility for our own safety and protection of our children as a God-given right. We are proud to exercise that right, are not ashamed of it and deserve nothing less than absolute respect and admiration as lawful gun owners.''' ,'''Well, what every place needs is a security plan that protects it.''' ,'''If you aren't free to protect yourself - when government puts its thumb on that freedom - then you aren't free at all.''' ,'''I tell gun owners and hunters and sportsmen and Second Amendment supporters and Americans every day that all of these freedoms we have are just words on a piece of parchment paper unless we stand up and defend them every day.''' ,'''If we do not elect a national legislature that will hold Obama accountable, he and his radical cohorts will destroy the tree of liberty. Just mark my words.''' ,'''In all of history, there has always been a time and a place where patriots rise up against the decree of the elites and shout, 'No more... get your hands off my freedom!'''' ,'''In truth, we are the only developed country on earth with a constitution that recognizes the God-given right to keep and bear arms, and the human right of individual armed defense of self, family, home and country.''' ,'''Socialism is a movement that loves a smear.''' ,'''What gun owners would support policies that are blatantly designed to strip them of their constitutional freedom? To put it bluntly: gullible gun owners.''' ,'''Obama cannot erase the Second Amendment without crippling or controlling exercise of the First Amendment.''' ,'''Do you want to know where President Barack Obama is ultimately headed with his gun control edicts? Look no further than his second embrace of the tyranny of Australia's massive gun 'buyback' program.''' ,'''If the U.N. gun-ban treaty is ever signed and ratified into law, we may never get a second chance to save the Second Amendment.''' ,'''With same-day registration, no requirement for a valid, dated photo ID for voters is an invitation to fraud and corruption of our electoral process.''' ,'''I think we need national carry reciprocity.''' ,'''If I were a betting man, the odds are that Obama's White House and Justice Department will double down on their gun-control agenda by edict.''' ,'''Especially for NRA members, it was obvious from the get-go that Obama believes he is above any constitutional restraints.''' ,'''Good and evil. Right and wrong.Those are two fundamental opposing concepts that define the nature of humankind.''' ,'''The only way President Obama and his cohorts could sell Obamacare was to conceal the law's true ramifications and convince those who were already content with their health insurance that they wouldn't be affected.''' ,'''History has proven again the truth that President Obama and anti-freedom activists everywhere deny and try to suppress - the truth that firearms in the hands of good people save lives.''' ,'''Nobody should be forced to face evil with empty hands.''' ,'''We need a full-court press on personal protection.

After the formation of the NRA Institute for Legislative Action in 1975, we did it, and we did it well.''' ,'''The future of the Second Amendment depends on the free exercise of the First Amendment.''' ,'''Obama and Holder would make it a felony not to submit to a rigorous grilling for anyone transferring any firearm anywhere in the nation including any now-legal private circumstances.''' ,'''There are only two reasons to compile list of gun owners: to tax them or to take them.''' ,'''We think it's reasonable to provide mandatory instant background checks for every sale at every gun show. No loopholes anywhere, for anyone.''' ,'''Obama, Bloomberg and nearly every politician and gun-ban zealot pushing for a universal background check system are on record supporting mandatory gun registration, outright bans and even confiscation. To them, 'universal background checks' are just the first step in their long march to destroying our Second Amendment-protected rights.''' ,'''President Obama, he's never going to debate me on guns.

After all, his personal fortune bought him public office.''' ,'''Gun owners are not buying firearms because they anticipate a confrontation with the government. Rather, we anticipate confrontations where the government isn't there - or simply doesn't show up in time.''' ,'''The whole idea from some of our opponents that armed security makes us less safe is completely ridiculous. If that's true, armed security makes us less safe, let's just go ahead and remove it from everywhere.''' ,'''It shouldn't be just the rich and the powerful that send their children to schools where there is armed security. Parents shouldn't be holding their breath because there's no security in schools they're sending their children to.''' ,'''Under Obama's intentional neglect, the most barbaric force in modern history - the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) - has taken form as a monstrous hoard and, like a hurricane, gathered power.''' ,'''There exists in this country, sadly, a callous, corrupt and corrupting shadow industry that sells and stows violence against its own people through vicious and violent video games.''' ,'''Billionaire Michael Bloomberg, among the world's richest men, believes his personal fortune can erase the liberty of every American who would exercise the right to keep and bear arms. He plans liquidation of our rights a step-at-a-time - spending millions of dollars of his bottomless personal fortune at a time.''' ,'''Obama, Bloomberg, and the national gun-ban media frequently exploit tragedy, using fear and lies to sell their agenda to non-gun owners, especially when it comes to election season. This is their traditional playbook.''' ,'''The Second Amendment is not just words on parchment. It's not some frivolous suggestion from our Founding Fathers to be interpreted by whim. It lies at the heart of what this country was founded upon.''' ,'''We know a Hillary Clinton White House would be ground zero for a massive attack on our freedom. A revolving door and cash register for every Michael Bloomberg, George Soros and every gun ban group in the world.''' ,'''If you aren't free to protect yourself when the government puts its thumb on that freedom, then you're not free at all.''' ,'''If you think the Obama White House and Ben Rhodes lying to the American people about Iran - and laughing about it - was bad, just wait until Hillary Clinton's spin doctors get hold of the media.''' ,'''Elites don't care not one whit about school children. If they truly cared, what they would do is protect them.''' ,'''Victimize gun owners, then blame the victims. That's the Chicago Way, and it will never change as long as city bosses are pathological in their hatred of our civil rights.''' ,'''As members of the oldest civil rights organization in the nation, NRA members know tyranny when we see it.''' ,'''Evil walks among us, and God help us if we don't harden our schools and protect our kids.''' ,'''Success in restoring and bolstering Second Amendment rights through aggressive legal challenges depends on you, your friends, family and colleagues.''' ,'''For Americans, with the advent of the U.S. invention of the Internet, free speech is not just open dissemination of ideas and information. It includes limitless instant access to those ideas and the ability to choose and search from among virtually unlimited sources. It is also the backbone of free enterprise and a vibrant global economy.''' ,'''When you're at war you do what it takes to win.''' ,'''Facts tell us that criminalizing private transfers of firearms among family members and friends under a universal background check system would do nothing to prevent 'gun violence,' and importantly, would not have prevented the profound tragedies that gun banners use to promote such a system.''' ,'''After Hurricane Sandy, we saw the hellish world that the gun prohibitionists see as their utopia. Looters ran wild in south Brooklyn. There was no food, water or electricity. And if you wanted to walk several miles to get supplies, you better get back before dark, or you might not get home at all.''' ,'''People that support more gun laws tend to have the least knowledge of the laws that are already on the books.''' ,'''From Obama to Michael Bloomberg, Dianne Feinstein, Michael Moore, Rosie O'Donnell and the rest of the media-political elite, the whole time they're attacking your right to own a gun, they're enjoying armed security for themselves.''' ,'''The NRA is where you resist, and stand and fight to put America back on track to restore and preserve our individual freedom.''' ,'''Whenever the creation of a national, computerized database of gun owners is proposed, the advocates pushing it insist that people have nothing to fear because politicians will not abuse the enormous power inherent in such a database.''' ,'''I think every school needs a protection plan with a either police officer or certified armed security.''' ,'''We know that, sooner or later, reckless government actions and policies have consequences. That when government corrupts the truth and breaks faith with the American people, the entire fabric of our society - everything we believe in and count on - is in jeopardy.''' ,'''Under Obama, we have seen the U.S. military - the most exceptional force for peace in the world - degraded, downsized, decimated and demeaned, resulting in massive international instability and potential threats to our homeland.''' ,'''These zealots for disarming individual Americans choose not to recognize the basic notion that defines American freedom: the difference between a good guy with a gun and a bad guy with a gun.''' ,'''There's not a mom or dad that wants to leave their child unprotected.''' ,'''The Internet, as the most open free-speech institution in history, has become a major factor in gun owners' ability to achieve success in preserving and protecting the Second Amendment.''' ,'''Those who still believe the United Nations is a human rights organization with the best of intentions are kidding themselves.''' ,'''The National Rifle Association - all that we believe in and fight for - has become a metaphor for the core American liberty we all want preserved.''' ,'''Our Founding Fathers knew that without Second Amendment freedom, all of our freedoms could be in jeopardy.''' ,'''The NRA was run like an old-time club when I took over. We were in the red and getting cut off from our membership.''' ,]
