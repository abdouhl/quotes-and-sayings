quotes = ['''I was fortunate enough to crash the right audition when I was 15, and just took it from there.''' ,'''Even more than the comedy thing, I really wanted to be an actor.''' ,'''As a Canadian, I feel like we all have a stake in the business here. And no matter how far you stray - and I've been down in L.A. for a long time - no matter how far you stray you have a stake in the state of the business... It really does matter and I'm always rooting for the entire country.''' ,'''There are very few actors in L.A. who can call their own shots. If you're able to work on something that you actually like working on, you're a very lucky person, and if you're able to keep it going, you're very fortunate.''' ,'''I can bluff with the best of them.''' ,''''MADtv' was a network show, so we would come across the people that we were lampooning - a lot.''' ,'''I sort of as a kid was fascinated with all the fat comedians, like John Candy, John Belushi, Benny Hill.''' ,'''Sometimes the stuff I come up with is so silly I feel like I need to apologize at the end of every one of them.''' ,'''Jonathan Sadowski is a kick in the pants; he's become a really good buddy.''' ,'''Anytime I get to come home and work, it is special for me.''' ,'''Well, it's probably not something I'm conscious of, but I do gravitate towards characters that are kind of like me.''' ,'''At any kind of Fox function, you'll see 'Mad TV' at the kiddy table in the back, next to the buffet. We're a late-night sketch show, and there is more money in prime time.''' ,'''I'm from Vancouver and friends of mine will shoot something up in Vancouver and they'll be like, 'Ugh.' They've never been to Vancouver and they're like, 'They got me stuck in Vancouver for three months.' I'm like, 'No, you're being set free. It's one of the most livable cities in the entire world.'''' ,'''I really preferred the characters I could totally create by myself, because I always think of myself as an actor first.''' ,'''I'm not an impressionist as such, and I never will be, so the sketches where I was supposed to be a famous person probably weren't my best work.''' ,'''A good sketch show, in my opinion, gets together a bunch of fun, funny people and collects their brainfarts, and shares them.''' ,'''Shatner will spin lines in ways you don't see coming - he winds the audience down like a spring and hits the line so hard, they erupt. It's amazing to watch actually.''' ,'''The Internet is a sketch show.''' ,'''That's what I love about 'MADtv': If you exist, if you breathe, we will take you down.''' ,'''I've been acting since I was 15 years old professionally, and I've never been asked on the 'TODAY' show or anything like that. And now here I am on the 'TODAY' show, it's bizarre!''' ,'''I like playing average guys who have a little extra something.''' ,'''I've never done a role because I was supposed to be the overweight guy.''' ,'''I want to be known as the Daniel Day-Lewis of TV dads.''' ,'''Some things tend to parody themselves, and we don't need to do it very much. 'Survivor' is like that.''' ,'''I don't like aggressive humor or mean humor.''' ,'''I think it's important as an actor to stay really ignorant.''' ,'''It may sound kind of brash but you really do have to treat it like just another job. It could be over tomorrow, and if you invest too much of yourself in, 'Hey I am the show and the show is me,' you'll get snapped hard.''' ,'''As a kid I would watch 'SCTV,' 'Saturday Night Live,' 'Monty Python' and 'The Kids in the Hall,' and be amazed that these guys got to be different people every week. It spoke to the acting side in me.''' ,'''When you get to do something based on a true story, it always raises the level of excitement.''' ,'''Julius Sharpe and his wife are extremely loving parents, and because I follow them on Instagram, I always see them, you know, building forts in their living room with their daughters, and doing this and that.''' ,'''Sketch comes from everyday life. You can see someone on the street, and it can turn into a five-minute sketch.''' ,'''Pretty soon I may have to go back to Canada and buy that lumberyard I've always wanted. I'll probably sell some lumber, bring in some lumber... look at exploiting that lumber somehow. I'm not very schooled in it, but being an actor I feel that I have a keen sensibility with regard to the world of lumber because those two businesses are so similar.''' ,'''I was fortunate to literally find my style on camera working in Canada.''' ,'''I was blown away all the time by just how amazing people are in Canada, because even if they hated me, they still would try to help me.''' ,'''I wanted to be on 'Saturday Night Live' when I was a kid. It was kind of like growing up playing a sport, wanting to be drafted by your favorite team.''' ,'''It's how we live, making fun of ourselves.''' ,]
