Some prayers have a longer voyage than others, but then they return with their richer lading at last, so that the praying soul is a gainer by waiting for an answer.''' ,'''God's wounds cure, sin's kisses kill.''' ,'''Let your hope of heaven master your fear of death.''' ,'''And while God had work for Paul, he found him friends both in court and prison. Let persecutors send saints to prison, God can provide a keeper for their turn.''' ,'''All the plots of hell and commotions on earth have not so much as shaken God's hand to spoil one letter or line he has been drawing.''' ,'''Compare not thyself with those that have less than thyself, but look on those that have far exceeded thee.''' ,'''Humble souls are fearful of their own strength.''' ,'''The devil had as good have let Paul alone, for he no sooner comes into prison but he falls a preaching, at which the gates of Satan's prison fly open, and poor sinners come forth.''' ,'''We have peace with God as soon as we believe, but not always with ourselves. The pardon may be past the prince's hand and seal, and yet not put into the prisoner's hand.''' ,'''Justifying faith is not a naked assent to the truths of the gospel.''' ,'''Great comforts do, indeed, bear witness to the truth of thy grace, but not to the degree of it; the weak child is oftener in the lap than the strong one.''' ,'''Mercy should make us ashamed, wrath afraid to sin.''' ,'''God hath made it a debt which one saint owes to another to carry their names to a throne of grace.''' ,'''The soldier is summoned to a life of active duty and so is the Christian.''' ,'''In heaven we shall appear, not in armour, but in robes of glory. But here these are to be worn night and day; we must walk, work, and sleep in them, or else we are not true soldiers of Christ.''' ,'''The grace thou hast will soon be less, if thou addest not more to it.''' ,'''Compare Scripture with Scripture. False doctrines, like false witnesses, agree not among themselves.''' ,]
