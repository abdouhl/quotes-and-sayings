He was a different businessman. His campaign was different. What you saw in his campaign is what you're going to see in his presidency.''' ,'''The chief of staff has to reflect and sometimes complement the strengths of the president he serves.''' ,'''When the manufacturing decline began in earnest in 2001, the main culprits were the offshoring of jobs to China, with which we have no trade deal, and automation.''' ,'''Most Republicans and the business community extol the virtues of trade, depicting it as an engine of economic progress, while most Democrats and unions attack the exportation of American jobs, claiming that trade agreements are destroying our economy.''' ,'''Sanders insists the party adopt 'the most progressive platform ever passed' at its Philadelphia convention. Since when does the runner-up get to dictate the platform?''' ,'''No one knows the Senate better than Joe Biden; he lived there for 35 years.''' ,'''Bernie Sanders is making a big and potentially dangerous mistake with his continuing insistence on changes to the Democratic Party's rules and platform. I should know.

Letting more non-Democrats choose the nominee doesn't guarantee success in a November general election.

I did OK, not great in any of my academic endeavors.''' ,'''Trade is an integral part of our foreign policy.''' ,'''It sounds good to say, 'We're going to do this,' on C-SPAN, but try to do that in real life, and it's not going to work.''' ,'''Centrist voters typically decide general elections, so hard-left or hard-right platforms don't help.''' ,'''Bob Gates understands the difficulty of going to war. This is a man who spent almost his entire life working for the government.''' ,'''The Republican establishment's 2008 embrace of Palin set an irresponsibly low bar. Coincidence or not, a batch of nonsense-spewing, hard-right candidates quickly followed, often to disastrous effect.''' ,'''As president, you can't just say, 'I want this,' or, 'Do that.' A president has to lead the American people to where he wants to go, and the chief of staff needs to help him get it done.''' ,'''There's a growing sense among large corporations that to solve global problems like climate change, the responsibility can't fall just on the government. The business community has to be a big piece of that.''' ,'''When a state offers your company an attractive package of incentives to relocate, you have to look at it, and if it significantly boosts your bottom line, you have to take it or answer to your investors.''' ,'''There is no path to middle-class prosperity without tearing down barriers to American exports.''' ,'''Now that Donald Trump has won the presidency despite losing the popular vote, there's a growing cry to rethink, or even abolish, the electoral college.
