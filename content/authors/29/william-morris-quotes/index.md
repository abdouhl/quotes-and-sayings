Memory and imagination help him as he works.''' ,'''The true secret of happiness lies in taking a genuine interest in all the details of daily life.''' ,'''I can't enter into politico-social subjects with any interest, for on the whole, I see that things are in a muddle, and I have no power or vocation to set them right in ever so little a degree.''' ,'''Not on one strand are all life's jewels strung.''' ,'''I am going, if I can, to be an architect, and I am too old already, and there is no time to lose.''' ,'''The past is not dead, it is living in us, and will be alive in the future which we are now helping to make.''' ,'''Apart from the desire to produce beautiful things, the leading passion of my life has been and is hatred of modern civilization.''' ,]
