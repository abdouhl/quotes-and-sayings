quotes = ['''An unmarried man, in my opinion, enjoys only half a life.''' ,'''Just as people behave to me, so do I behave to them. When I see that a person despises me and treats me with contempt, I can be as proud as any peacock.''' ,'''I thank my God for graciously granting me the opportunity of learning that death is the key which unlocks the door to our true happiness.''' ,'''When I come to reflect on the subject, in no country have I received such honors or been so esteemed as in Italy, and nothing contributes more to a man's fame than to have written Italian operas, and especially for Naples.''' ,'''Believe me, I do not like idleness but work.''' ,'''One must not make oneself cheap here - that is a cardinal point - or else one is done. Whoever is most impertinent has the best chance.''' ,'''When I am traveling in a carriage, or walking after a good meal, or during the night when I cannot sleep; it is on such occasions that ideas flow best and most abundantly.''' ,'''The happy medium - truth in all things - is no longer either known or valued; to gain applause, one must write things so inane that they might be played on barrel-organs, or so unintelligible that no rational being can comprehend them, though on that very account, they are likely to please.''' ,'''We live in this world in order always to learn industriously and to enlighten each other by means of discussion and to strive vigorously to promote the progress of science and the fine arts.''' ,'''If I were obliged to marry all those with whom I have jested, I should have at least two hundred wives.''' ,'''My Constanze is the virtuous, honourable, discreet, and faithful darling of her honest and kindly-disposed Mozart.''' ,'''I know nothing new except that Herr Gellert, the Leipzig poet, is dead, and has written no more poetry since his death.''' ,'''Neither a lofty degree of intelligence nor imagination nor both together go to the making of genius. Love, love, love, that is the soul of genius.''' ,'''My father is maestro at the Metropolitan church, which gives me an opportunity to write for the church as much as I please.''' ,'''My sole recreations consist in dancing English hornpipes and cutting capers. Italy is a land of sleep; I am always drowsy here.''' ,'''I cannot write poetically, for I am no poet. I cannot make fine artistic phrases that cast light and shadow, for I am no painter. I can neither by signs nor by pantomime express my thoughts and feelings, for I am no dancer; but I can by tones, for I am a musician.''' ,'''I am one of those who will go on doing till all doings are at an end.''' ,'''I pay no attention whatever to anybody's praise or blame. I simply follow my own feelings.''' ,'''As for pupils, I can have as many as I choose, but I do not choose to take many. I intend to be better paid than others, and so I wish to have fewer scholars. It is advisable to hang back a little at first, or it is all over with you, and you must pursue the common highway with the rest.''' ,'''Versification is, indeed, indispensable for music, but rhyme, solely for rhyming's sake, most pernicious.''' ,'''How sad it is that these great gentlemen should believe what anyone tells them and do not choose to judge for themselves! But it is always so.''' ,'''I hope never to marry in this way; I wish to make my wife happy, but not to become rich by her means, so I will let things alone and enjoy my golden freedom till I am so well off that I can support both wife and children.''' ,'''Nevertheless the passions, whether violent or not, should never be so expressed as to reach the point of causing disgust; and music, even in situations of the greatest horror, should never be painful to the ear but should flatter and charm it, and thereby always remain music.''' ,'''It is a great consolation for me to remember that the Lord, to whom I had drawn near in humble and child-like faith, has suffered and died for me, and that He will look on me in love and compassion.''' ,'''I live in a country where music has very little success, though, exclusive of those who have forsaken us, we have still admirable professors and, more particularly, composers of great solidity, knowledge, and taste.''' ,]
