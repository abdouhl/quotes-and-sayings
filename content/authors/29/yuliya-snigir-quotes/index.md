quotes = ['''I came to Los Angeles only after filming 'A Good Day to Die Hard,' when I was cast in the independent movie 'Delirium.' Director Lee Roy Kunz was looking everywhere for a Russian actress. He saw my photos, and only then he learned where I starred before! Eventually, I spent several months in the U.S., and we made the film quickly.''' ,'''For me, it's very offensive when I notice that it's all about my appearance, how I look, that a man doesn't care who I am.''' ,'''In American films, Russians are often portrayed like cartoon villains without clear motivations.''' ,'''In chess, you should be as cool as a cucumber.''' ,'''My dream was to play in good films, no matter in what country. I always waited for a decent script, and nothing has changed. I'm just sure that nothing in life is random, and I believe in the fate which guides you. Probably my starring in 'A Good Day to Die Hard' is good proof of that.''' ,'''Thank God, I have sort of a pan-European accent rather than Russian, which doesn't sound very pleasantly to Americans. For them, we speak with a rather rude pitch, and that might be our actors' problem there. Now I've begun working with language coaches in Los Angeles to get rid of the accent completely.''' ,'''I'm learning to be braver with colorful clothes, even if they're a little wild.''' ,]
