- There is a little bit of me in every part I do... I'm not really good enough to completely construct an all-new character.
- I think my strength is always been in being very natural. I think Shakespeare and things like that would be more a stretch for me.
- I wanted to be an actor when I saw the movie 'Die Hard.' I saw Bruce Willis shooting guns and blowing stuff up, and I thought, 'I wanna do that.' It really had nothing to do with acting; I just wanted a job that allowed me to do fun, bigger-than-life stuff.
- I'm compulsively on time. It drives me insane when people are late.
- I used to like the word of the day and when I read, highlight words that I didn't know and look them up.
- I never had any film training. I went to Northwestern. I studied education and theater. So it was all theater training.
- I hate when a movie just sort of ends and is so open-ended you feel like it wasn't finished. I appreciate leaving things up to the interpretation of the audience and letting them make decisions about where things will go in the future - but the director has to make a decision; otherwise it is sort of a cop-out.
- I really have no preference between TV and film. I think that each individual project is its own thing and has a very different style.
