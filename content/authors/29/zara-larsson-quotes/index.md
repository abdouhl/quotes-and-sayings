- I always sang after every dinner or when we had people over or when we had a show in school. I just loved to be on stage and sing in front of people.
- If it weren't for singing, I don't know what else I would do with myself.
- I work so hard, but... everything just goes my way! It's insane!
- I wear jewellery that I never take off. I have a ring and two necklaces. I always have them on and get scared when I have to take them off for photo shoots. The ring is my mum's mum's mum's, and she gave it to me for my 18th birthday. The necklace is the same one that my sister has. She's called Hannah, and the name is the chain.
- When I look at my streams on Spotify, and I just see it's hundreds of millions of streams, I think, 'Wow, that's amazing.' But you don't really get it. Once you see people in front of you singing along to your songs, it's real.

- Could you imagine being from Siberia? Like, a small part of Russia, where it's like, 'When was the last time Russia was having a super big international pop star in the U.S.?' I don't know, but I can name a few from Sweden. I think that gives us a lot of confidence in being pop stars because we're like, 'Oh, we actually can. We know we can.'
- Beyonce's the only contemporary artist that I really, really idolize.
- I love to have a band, but dancers are my priority because I really want a show, you know?
- I would say that the majority of the people I work with are Swedish, very unknown producers and writers but so talented.
- I think whatever you love the most is where you should spend your money.
- Mostly, I just write about feelings that people can relate to. Because, yeah, I don't know who I am, and this is not my sound forever... I'm a human, so hopefully, I will always develop.

- In my personal life, I would just feel like, I will always be cool with everyone.

- I like to spend as much time with my friends and family as possible.
- I do pop, so pop is very broad. It could be anything from the Weeknd to Taylor Swift to Beyonce to whatever is on the radio, basically.
- It's very, very important to wash off makeup. Like, really wash it off - I used to be really bad and leave some on when I would go to bed, but it's so important to get it all off.
- I don't really have a type. I don't want to be a cliche. But personality is a big thing for me. You can find cute guys all over. But he's got to have some sort of sense of humor, which is so hard to find in a guy. He's got to be a bit smart.

- Of course, I consider myself a feminist, but I wouldn't say I'm a feminist genius or anything.
- I think my thing is that... I don't know. And that's why I don't wanna sing about 'This is me, this is who I am' because, like, even the question, 'Tell me about yourself' - what are you supposed to say? 'Ooh, I'm a happy girl, but I'm sad, too'? People are so complex.

- When I was about nine or 10, I was on a few random talent shows in shopping malls.

- I've always wanted to be a singer.
- I've always loved to perform in front of people, but it became pretty serious when I participated in 'Sweden's Got Talent.' I thought it would be a fun thing to do, and I was just like, 'OK, why not?' And Mom was like, 'OK, sure, sure, do this!' So I did, and I won it!
- Sweden will always be my home, since my childhood there was like a fairytale, so I'll always go back to it.
- We're here for a little, little bit of time, and I just wanna make the most out of it.
- A lot of my friends send me Snapchats of when they're in the club, and they're like, 'It's your song!'
- Some people can't sing - like honestly - but they're famous anyway, and they might be famous for being an artist, which is completely different from being a singer.
- I'm still so young, so I feel like people have wanted to keep me in a 'no-makeup' fresh type of look - sometimes artists are a little afraid of really putting the makeup on me.
- That's a beautiful thing. The more successful you are, the more people are going to come and be a part of music.
- In the car on my way to the studio, I was listening to 'Where Are U Now' with Justin Bieber and Jack U, so I was like, 'Wow, this is such a banger.' I loved the thought of having a ballad at the beginning and then just a massive drop.
- I love eyebrows, so brow pencils and brow shadow are really important to me.
- I have some friends, and they're super-hipster. And they're like, 'All I wanna do is sing in a jazz bar and to just make it to pay for the rent.' And I'm like, 'Cool... That's not what I wanna do. I want as many people as possible to go to my concert.'
- I'm just being me on Instagram, and that's what I love about it. It's definitely personal, and it's, like, no one in my team would ever get my password for my Instagram. Like, that's a no-no.

- The Monsters & Strangerz, I love them so much.
- Literally, when I go to the vocal coach, I'm like, 'You are teaching me nothing.' You know?
