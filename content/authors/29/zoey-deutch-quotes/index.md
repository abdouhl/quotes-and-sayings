- I am a very, very avid 'Anchorman' fan.
- I get really nervous when people are like, 'I saw you in a trailer! I saw you on TV!' Genuinely, my cheeks get red.
- My mom passed on her obsession of all things antique or vintage. I love to go thrift store shopping or explore any sort of garage sale. Treasure hunting is a family passion.
- My signature look is an eighties baby doll dress, combat boots with colorful socks sticking out, and then mounds of jewelry. I love silver and turquoise. I go to Montana every winter, so I hunt around for cool pieces there.
- I'm such a fan of Shailene Woodley, so I'm super excited to see all her stuff. She's an awesome actress.
- I never thought I would become that person who loves working out. It sucks while you're doing it, but the second you finish, it's like, 'Wow, I feel great! I'm stronger and much more confident.'
- My parents were reluctant to let me start auditioning until I was at least a little bit emotionally stable - I'm still working on that! And so I started when I was fifteen, and it was the best thing that could have happened to me in terms of being able to focus my crazy teenage energy into something good.
- You see, every day, that the people who are seemingly so confident and seemingly so in love with themselves are the ones who are the most insecure and hurting the most inside.
- I think people know that I love food, but maybe people don't know that I cook a lot.
- I'm not a writer. I'm not smart. I couldn't possibly even write my own story.
- I'm a total hip-hop geek. That's my favorite kind of music to listen to while getting ready.
- In high school, I tried very hard to make everybody like me, which resulted in me being extremely unhappy and in a lot of pain. Therefore, the lesson I got from that was that I can't make everybody happy.
- Borderline embarrassing fact: I used to have a pseudo line when I was seven called Zizzy Fashion. I love clothing, and I would eventually like to design as well as act.
- I'm being hypocritical because I have a Twitter, but I try to not talk about things like, 'Oh, I had a grapefruit this morning and it was delicious,' because, who cares?
- I'm not going to give up salt and sugar because I want to look like Adriana Lima. But I am going to work out to make myself feel good in my own body.
- It's nice to have my mother as someone I can talk to about acting. My dad's a director, so when he comes to watch me on set, he think it's his set. He's always telling a production assistant, 'Can you get me five donuts?'
- I've always wanted to be an actress as well as a fashion designer.
- My parents are supportive of anything I want to do, as long as it's not bad.
- Bullies generally were bullied and are hurting inside much more than you could ever imagine.
- I'm always, all the time, eating chocolate. I eat pretty healthy, but then I go all out when it has to do with chocolate.
- I think being able to really fall in love with someone is the craziest thing that could ever happen. You know, allowing yourself to really go there and really feel those things is extremely scary.
- I find humor to be the most attractive characteristic, but I certainly won't cancel anything out, considering when you love someone you love someone, and sometimes you just can't explain it.
- I'm pretty terrible at writing, so the way I kind of therapeutically get through things is by drawing.
- I feel naked without my rings, and don't like walking out of the house without them, even if they do tear half of my sweaters and stab my friends in the eye.
- My sister, mom and I all wear the same size, so I shop a lot at a boutique called 'my mother's closet' that is right down the hall from my bedroom. She has vintage Comme des Garcons dresses that I feel so elegant wearing.
- One thing my family has shown me is that having a sense of humor is everything.
