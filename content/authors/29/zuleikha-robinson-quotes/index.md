- I'm mostly vegetarian.
- 'Lone Gunmen' was my first job, and I got a little cocky, thinking I'm brilliant and don't have to work that hard because it comes so naturally.
- I like to frequent antiques shops and flea markets like the Rose Bowl in Pasadena.
- Only twice have I really had a hard time leaving a character. The first was my character in 'Rome' and then in 'Homeland.'
- I do like to play the darker characters; I don't really know why.
- I honestly never really watch the Emmys.
- When I got the role in 'Homeland,' it really opened something up. Other people respected me more as an actor, doors were opened, and I understood for the first time that it wasn't personal. All that rejection wasn't personal.
- I definitely like to play characters that don't fit any kind of mold; that are slightly offbeat, because it's more fun to play.
- I did go through a phase where I played videogames quite often, but I haven't in a few years.
- It took a lot of time to find my stride, and it was really humbling.
- The only time a friend has ever helped me in the industry was how I got my first job - that was through Mike Figgis.
