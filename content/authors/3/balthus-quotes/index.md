There is hardly anyone left who really possesses it. For evidence one has only to look at the painters of this century.''' ,'''Painting is a language which cannot be replaced by another language. I don't know what to say about what I paint, really.''' ,'''The best way to begin is to say: Balthus is a painter of whom nothing is known.
