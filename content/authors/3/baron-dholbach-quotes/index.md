- Nothing can be more contrary to religion and the clergy than reason and common sense.
- When we examine the opinions of men, we find that nothing is more uncommon than common sense; or, in other words, they lack judgment to discover plain truths or to reject absurdities and palpable contradictions.
- Religion unites man with God, or forms a communication between them; yet do they not say, 'God is infinite?' If God be infinite, no finite being can have communication or relation with him.
- If God be an infinite being, there cannot be, either in the present or future world, any relative proportion between man and his God. Thus, the idea of God can never enter the human mind.
- To discover the true principles of Morality, men have no need of theology, of revelation, or of gods: They have need only of common sense.
