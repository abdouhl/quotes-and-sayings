- My favorite Broadway show day-to-day, just for the experience, was 'The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee.' The people were so much fun. It was a great show.
- Someone made me a Leaf Coneybear finger puppet. Someone made me a portrait of me on some chocolate. I'm keeping it. I daren't eat such a work of art. It's so unique and so fun that fans do that. It's incredibly flattering. I like it when people spend time on me. People don't spend the same amount of time on my brother who's an insurance broker.
- I love the immediacy of an audience being there and reacting. I'm spoiled, having grown up in theater.
- Basically, my goal in life is to be David Hyde Pierce - go to Hollywood, make some money, come back and just win some Tony Awards.
- Linda Hunt is so good and so sweet. She is a Tony Award nominee and won an Oscar. Pearls just come out of her mouth.
- Cyndi Lauper is really good at talking to you about normal things. It's strange to be in the presence of a big celebrity like that. You want to make these connections and say things related to being a fan. It's not as interesting for them. She's amazing at making small talk without it seeming small.
- There's something so quirky and fun and nerdy about the Tony Awards... We're dorks being silly up there.
- I am an Apple guy. I got the iPhone 4 the day it came out. I have a MacBook.
- LL Cool J is a huge presence. He is a music mogul. He brings that experience and that life into the room.
