Why? Because you have to be very closely linked to the beliefs of the people. This is the core issue.''' ,'''None of us and none of the Arabs trust Israel.''' ,'''Hizbullah is not a militia.''' ,'''It should be known that Israel is based on treachery.''' ,'''Despite the ethnic diversity within each nation, the social fabric of the region by and large is one.''' ,'''America is interested in re-arranging the region as it sees fit.''' ,'''We are dealing with treachery and threats, which accompanied the establishment of Israel.''' ,'''The problem with the West is that they start with political reform going towards democracy. If you want to go towards democracy, the first thing is to involve the people in decision making, not to make it.''' ,'''I am Syrian, I was made in Syria, I have to live in Syria and die in Syria.''' ,'''I am not a puppet. I was not made by the West to go to the West or to any other country.''' ,'''The logical thing is to implement the Arab Defense Agreement.''' ,'''Is there an equality of power between America and Iraq?

Why? Because it was very clear that there are ways to resist.''' ,'''The most significant indicator that there is no disaster in Iraq is the fact that there is no exodus.''' ,'''Israel ranks her priorities in the following way: security, land, and water.''' ,'''You cannot reform your society or institution without opening your mind.''' ,'''It would be a mistake to link anything that Israel does to a certain circumstance. And it is a mistake to feel comfortable in any circumstance just because Israel did not act on it.''' ,'''It is even more so when it comes to Iraq, which is a large Arab country with scientific, material, and human resources and is able to accomplish, at the least, what Lebanon accomplished, and more.''' ,'''Israeli interests are not necessarily in harmony with the American interests.''' ,'''Worry does not mean fear, but readiness for the confrontation.''' ,'''When Lebanon started its resistance it was a small and divided country.''' ,'''Today, the Iraqi citizen sees that America is coming and wants to occupy his country and kill him, and he is willing to experience for himself what happened in Palestine.''' ,'''We believe that Lebanon has been the first real experience for all the Arabs.''' ,'''But the issue has to do with land, which is our land.''' ,'''Since its very inception, Israel has been a threat.''' ,'''You in Lebanon, your power is no match to Israel.

Then, the Syrian forces will return to their homeland.''' ,'''We, in Syria, our point of view stems from our experience.''' ,]
