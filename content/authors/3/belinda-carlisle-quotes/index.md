- There should be a lot of bands like the Go-Go's out there, but there aren't.
- Life's too short to be a Go-Go for twenty years.
- Being famous for fame's sake wasn't the goal when I co-founded the Go-Go's. I just wanted to sing and have a laugh.
- I mean, in rock music terms I'm like a dinosaur.
- When I started to make money, I went a bit crazy. Once, I went to the race track and woke up the next morning owning a horse.
- My son has made me more politically active when it comes to LGBTQ rights. When he came out, I worried about what the world was going to be like for him.
- I have an original voice. It may not be the best voice, but it's distinct, and I think that's what has carried me through the years.
- I just liked the idea of being engaged.
- I do a lot of solo work in Europe and the Far East, and my main passion is traveling.
- Anything that I ever do is from the heart and authentic.
- I love looking out in a crowded theater and seeing a sea of gay men.
- You never know what goes on behind closed doors.
- Since I was a young girl in the punk scene, almost all of my friends have been gay or lesbian, so for me, it's an obvious answer when it comes to whether or not gay people should be recognized as equal.
- I don't drink, I don't smoke, and I do a lot of yoga.
- I'm a little bit wary of people. It freaked me out when a fan connected with me on social media, then had plastic surgery to look like me, dyed his hair the same colour, and got a pug dog like mine. He was also a hacker, so I had to change all my passwords.
- Sometimes you are at the mercy of record companies or publishing companies.
- I've always known I could write. I have an ear for production and melody. It was just that, in those early years, I let everyone do it for me. To be honest, I was a little lazy!
- I grew up in Southern California and always loved melodic pop music.
- I've got a great family, great career, great friends, and a lot of passions, which make my life interesting and fulfilling every day.
- For me, it's simple: everybody deserves the same rights.
- The albums 'Heaven On Earth' and 'Runaway Horses' and 'Live Your Life Be Free' were harking back to when I was a young girl and listening to Californian radio - lush productions, complicated melodies, harmonies like the Beach Boys and the Mamas and Papas. That's what those albums remind me of.
- I had no musical training at all.
- You don't have to be age 20 and size zero to be sexually viable or viable as a woman.
- The musical differences are obvious: the Go-Go's are more punk, while my solo work is more soft pop. But they're equally as fun and enjoyable for me. I couldn't possibly put one over the other.
- A lot of people don't know that the Go-Go's came from the L.A. punk scene.
- To be able to drive a rickshaw legally, I had to get an international motorcycle license in L.A., which I have now.
- I would say the Go-Go's are pretty iconic but don't know if I'd refer to myself like that.
- When I recorded 'Sun,' I wanted to do something with more of a modern sound. I've never done anything like it, and it was fun for me to sing, but I'm not really a dance person per se. However, I would love to hear that song in the club. I think it's a really good dance song.
- I've been blessed from the very beginning with the large gay audience, and I'm flattered. They always have the best taste anyways and are at the forefront of fashion, music, and style. So I'm really happy about that and very flattered. It's a good following to have because it means you're doing something right.
- It will shock many - I've lived a full life and really enjoyed my time as a pop star.
- However, if you listen to me I think you can hear years of abuse in my voice - both bad abuse and good abuse.
- I was like the good girl, bad girl, there were no grey areas for me.
- Having Brian Wilson sing on my album was an unforgettable experience.
