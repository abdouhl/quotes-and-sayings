- I had a 'Cats' phase, where I did lots of overturned furniture and trash cans. I asked for a fog machine for my birthday.
- I was packing to go to Columbia University, and they told me that weekend that I got the 'Pitch Perfect.'
- There's something to be said for any boy growing up among lots of other boys who like to play basketball and football, while all I wanted to do was put on musicals. Mentally, I was always in my own world.
- 'Pitch Perfect 2' is about the Bellas and what happens to them as they get older. All your favorite characters are coming back. Chrissie Fit was great, and Hailee Steinfeld is such a pro - she fit right in. I had no idea she was 17! She's the most mature girl ever.
- We've done as best a job as we can making it clear that I'm earning what I'm earning because of me and not because of who my father is. But at the same time, I'm not ignoring things that would be dumb to ignore, like people that I can know through him and experiences I can have through him and things that I can learn from him.
- There was never anything else I wanted to pursue. It was always theater, and movies are a fairly new thing.
- From day one, musical theater was my bread and butter.
- I have had a struggle with anxiety, always, and as a proud Jew, that's not a surprising thing.
- If you had asked me, in the days of me dreaming about what would happen in the future, who I would want to write my first original musical, it would hands-down have been Pasek and Paul.
