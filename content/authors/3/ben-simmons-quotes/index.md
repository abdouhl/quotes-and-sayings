- Growing up in Australia and the way I was raised, my dad told me to play as a team and to be a team player. You have five guys on the court. It's easy for five guys to defend one guy. It's hard to guard five. It's just a natural thing to do.
- I just want to win. I'm a team guy. I just want my team to do well.
- I'm the best PlayStation player you'll ever see. I'll play anything. 'Call of Duty,' 'NBA2K,' 'Grand Theft Auto.'
- For me, I always try and deliver. Regardless of the situation, I always try and play hard every time I step out on the court. If I don't deliver and play well, then I know I haven't been working hard enough.
- I'll have time to mature and develop, and one day, hopefully, I can bring a ring to wherever I am. LeBron did it.
- I'm kind of ready for anything. I don't really get nervous, and I'm not the type of person who gets worried about a game. I just play the game, and I enjoy it.
- Getting the rebound and going, that's probably the most fluid part of my game.
- A lot of guys go into the NBA not being able to shoot the ball well, but then they become great shooters.
- I was in school to play basketball; I wasn't trying to be a doctor. It's hard to talk about the NCAA rules and everything that happened in the past because I've just been focused on practicing and getting ready... I was trying to reach my dreams, and that's to play in the NBA.
- I feel I can win the game without scoring 30 points.
- It's great to be compared to a great player like Tracy McGrady, but I think I'm my own type of player. I'm 6'10" and a bit bigger than he is as a player. I also think I'm a bit different and play a different position. He's more of a guard, and I can play all around through five.
- I've learned a lot just being around LeBron. People say things about him all the time, but he would never say anything back. That's what I learned from him: Don't retaliate to articles or pieces or to things that are said about me.
- I just like hanging out, really. I'm not too hard to please.
- LeBron's been like a big brother to me, watching me play and giving me pointers on just little things. I really look up to him.
- If I ever make a lot of money in the NBA, I'm going to have this massive tank, and it's going to have an alligator in it.
- I enjoyed my time at L.S.U. I wouldn't change it for anything. My dad went to college - my sisters, brothers - so I felt like I just had to, and I enjoyed it.
- Once I start shooting that jumper, I feel like I will be one of those guys that is hard to stop.
- If I don't need to shoot the ball, I won't do it.
- I guess, if it wasn't for Jordan, there would be no LeBron or Kobe who plays like that.
- People say a lot of things about LeBron, but he just keeps having a good mentality and grinding. That's what I try to do, proving people wrong by what I do on the court.
- I'm a big guy, but I play with a guard mentality. I got that from my dad, and it's always stayed with me.
- I loved my Communications class. The toughest one I had was Oceanography only because I didn't have too much interest in the oceans.
- I look at the N.B.A. as a job, a great job to have, so I think, for me, I would have loved the opportunity to go to the N.B.A. out of high school. If you're not ready, you're not ready. If you are ready, I think you should be able to go.
- I think my versatility is a big strength. I don't think anybody can guard me, just because I'm 6'10 and can dribble and play point. If I have a little guy on me, I take him to the post. For me to be able to then pass the ball, it helps me a lot.
