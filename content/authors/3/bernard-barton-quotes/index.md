quotes = ['''As I walk'd by myself, I talk'd to myself, And myself replied to me; And the questions myself then put to myself, With their answers I give to thee.''' ,'''No age, sex, or condition is above or below the absolute necessity of modesty; but without it one is vastly beneath the rank of man.''' ,'''Welcome, wild harbinger of spring! To this small nook of earth; Feeling and fancy fondly cling, Round thoughts which owe their birth, To thee, and to the humble spot, Where chance has fixed thy lowly lot.''' ,]
