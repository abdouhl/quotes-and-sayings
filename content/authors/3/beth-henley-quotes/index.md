- Then I went off to Southern Methodist University in Dallas. They had a really wonderful theatre department.
- I'm very into the first production of the show.
- Then, when I was a senior in high school, I was kind of bereft and she put me in an acting class.
- It's really interesting that whenever you do something that is so out of character, like having an emotional outburst, that you don't get in trouble.
- My first few plays took place in the South and even The Lucky Spot was in the thirties but in Louisiana.
- Part of that is that New York has proved to be too much fun for me to live and work; I love New York so much.

- I was just restless with being in school; so I went out to Los Angeles.
