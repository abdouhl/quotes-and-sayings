- At home, he's a 100-percent softie; that's who he is. I just blew his cover. When Howard has a really stressful day at work or he feels overwhelmed, it's funny, I point to the foster room.

So I always say check out the adult animals that are there first.

- I don't have children, so I can focus on my mission to save helpless animals.

- When cats scratch the furniture, it's only because they're trying to sharpen their claws, which means they get so long that they want to grind them down. So if you trim their claws routinely, it helps tremendously.
- In every single one of my purses, even my little satin clutch and my tiny Chanel bag, I always carry a lint roller. I keep them in every drawer, in every desk and nightstand. I just buy those at the dollar store in bulk.
- When you adopt an animal at a shelter you are saving two lives.
