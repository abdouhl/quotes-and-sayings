It takes a lot of skill. Not everyone who tries can do it well. We need to admit that and act accordingly.

The momentum is there on the state level in many states. That's where the energy needs to be harnessed in a new way.''' ,'''It is not fair to think that when students transit through a K-12 system that is not preparing them for beyond, that somehow we are going to wave a magic wand and things are going to be perfect for them at the higher-ed level.''' ,'''If you ask any of my kids today what their most important experience was in their education, they would say it was the travel and the ability to see and be in other cultures.''' ,'''I will not be conflicted.
