- I think every athlete wants to get sponsored. If you do really well in your sport, then I think sponsorship can help you get rewarded in that sense: doing what you can for your sponsor. It's just another achievement in life.
- The World Championship gold was a surprise and took a lot of pressure off in terms of qualifying for Rio, but I still need more points, and winning in Manchester would be massive for me.
- If I hadn't won at the Worlds and claimed so many ranking points, I would have been struggling for Rio. I'm in a good place now, though, and having the chance to fight for gold in Rio after everything I've been through would be a dream.
- There are a lot of kicks out there in taekwondo that are flashy, so I like all of those. My favourite is probably chop because I'm better at it than the others. But I like a good back kick if I can nail it well.
- If I'm able to win the world championships when I'm not even at my best, then with another year until Rio, maybe I could even become Olympic champion.
