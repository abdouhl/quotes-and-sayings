- The court can, and must, only maintain its legitimacy through the dispensation of justice, not by coercion and censorship.
- Too many of us had to suffer at the hands of a judiciary so independent that it often acted independently of both the basic principles of jurisprudence and the very constitution it swore to uphold and protect.

- I grew up overnight on that day, Dec. 27, 2007.
- In 1988, my mother led a nationwide election campaign, wrote a bestselling book, had her first child, and became the youngest and first female prime minister of the Muslim world. All in one year! For her detractors, this wasn't good enough. She was unacceptable because she was a woman.
- I have a lot of security - I lost my mother to the Taliban because of a lack of security - and that explains partly why I can be so vocal.
- I know every child thinks of their mother as superwoman; I certainly did.
- My grandfather was a very courageous man, and I consider myself very lucky because I have three powerful role models that will obviously influence my career choices when I am older.
- If all you have to criticise me on is my age or my accent, then you really can't defeat me on the issues.

- I am chairman of the Pakistan People's Party.
- I have said that propaganda, misinformation, and disinformation have always been part of political warfare. Social media and other new platforms have given it a new life and reach through which the fake news phenomenon can reach everywhere.

- If I was to say I had a life, that would be a lie.
- Netflix is a lifesaver.
- President Zardari came to power just as the global recession hit. He had to cobble together an unruly coalition, put up with a constant assault from a conservative supreme court who sought to undermine him at every term. This does not include dealing with Pakistani's omnipotent establishment and the menace of terrorism.
- I think censorship in the name of fighting fake news is a dangerous thing for Pakistan.
- Bhutto is an emotion, a love.
- My mother began her political journey as a symbol of hope and resistance to the repressive, regressive, Islamist regime of General Ziaul Haq.
- How is it reasonable that in a country purporting to be a democracy, I am not permitted to speak freely? Why, as a politician, should I be banned from expressing political opinions? Why, as a student of history, can I not present the facts as I see them, without fear of reprisal?
- Ultimately, the forces of dictatorship and extremism robbed me of my mother, but she lives on as a symbol of hope, a role model for women across the world. She proved beyond a doubt, with her life and relentless courage, that women can certainly do everything.
- I would like to help my people in any way I can. It's difficult times in Pakistan and we all have to help.
- I can't let my mother's death have been in vain. Democracy is the best revenge, and we will have it.

- As a son, and a Pakistani citizen, I could not be more proud of President Zardari.
