quotes = ['''Time is the one thing I can't get back and can't give back to you.''' ,'''If you're a technology investor, and you decide that you're also going to be a healthcare investor or a green-tech investor, that doesn't usually work out that well. There are reasons why people make their careers studying these things and becoming experts.''' ,'''In genomics, there's a massive amount of information in which you can look for patterns and develop insights.''' ,'''The reality is the technology exists now to extend life and have people live healthier, happier lives. Not to be kind of immortal - that's not what I'm talking about.''' ,'''We actually have the tools in the life sciences to achieve anything that you have the audacity to envision. I just hope to live long enough not to die.''' ,'''Google Ventures has a direct financial incentive to ensure the companies we invest in succeed.''' ,'''If I'm an entrepreneur, and I have a term sheet from Sequoia and Kleiner, that's the safe choice. Google Ventures is the brave choice.''' ,'''We make a series of investments, some will pan out and some won't.''' ,'''I used to be a health-care investor a long time ago in the public markets. One thing I learned that we tried to apply here is that investing in small molecules, trying to invest in the next treatment, there's an element of gambling to that.''' ,'''CEOs who can hire properly, that's the most important part of the job. The CEO's job is really to hire the right team and execute the vision second.''' ,'''When you apply computer science and machine learning to areas that haven't had any innovation in 50 years, you can make rapid advances that seem really incredible.''' ,'''If you want to invest in early-stage technologies, putting a timeframe on it does behold you to Silicon Valley economics. You've got a certain time period where you have to make the money. And you have to invest that money whether you find good companies or not.''' ,'''I loved dinosaurs, I loved space, and I thought maybe I'd be the first paleo-astronaut.''' ,'''People talk about the redistribution of wealth a lot, which is a very valid topic. But what about the redistribution of health? That's even more concentrated at the top.''' ,'''Healthcare is becoming part of information technology.''' ,'''I sign off not only every investment, but every dollar that goes out the door - I'm aware of it.''' ,'''Google was a venture-funded company. Being part of that brings an energy to the company.''' ,'''We can get much better outcomes from people if we understand the genetic basis of the exact cancer that they have, what interventions might be most effective against it, what's worked in the past and what hasn't.''' ,'''There are environmental threats to health; there are internal threats to health - genetic conditions, viral threats, diseases like cancer and Parkinson's. And then there are societal and global ones, like poverty and lack of nutrition. And unknown viral threats - everything from a new kind of influenza to hemorrhagic fever.''' ,'''Back in the late 1990s, venture capitalists got very excited about the Internet. A whole lot of money was poured into some companies that failed rather spectacularly, and a lot of people lost a lot of money.''' ,'''Humans are terrible at predicting the future. We really overestimate what we can do in the short term and underestimate what we can do in the long term... If we can glimpse even a couple of years into the future, even that's difficult to do.''' ,'''I contemplated a career at NIH at one point. I have a neuroscience background.''' ,'''Your genome isn't really secret.''' ,'''As life expectancy extends beyond 80 years in some parts of the world, more people are struggling with brain diseases. For older people, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and other conditions become a major impediment to quality of life.''' ,'''Say you have cancer - you have this broad thing we call cancer; we're going to irradiate you and pump this poisonous material into you and hope more of the bad stuff dies than the good. That is going to seem so medieval when we can fix it on a genetic level, and Foundation Medicine is the first step to diagnosing it on a genetic level.''' ,'''Silicon Valley has been a technology capital like New York is a financial capital.''' ,'''Not many venture firms have people whose job is to read academic research - on startups, ventures, and entrepreneurs - and gather knowledge from that.''' ,'''Big ideas we tend to like are the ones that seem impossible or crazy.''' ,'''Venture funds get beaten up for not investing in important things. Okay, if you want venture funds to invest in important things, then don't penalize or make fun of them when those important things don't work.''' ,'''I can make it very clear: I get paid if we make good investments. And if we don't, I don't get paid. I have no incentive to sell our companies to Google; the entrepreneurs get to decide that. We are minority shareholders.''' ,'''The reality is if you were going to die tomorrow, and someone offered you another 10 years, most people would take those 10 years.''' ,'''We are looking for highly technical, enthusiastic and capable entrepreneurs who have a healthy disregard for the impossible, and that's not always easy to find.''' ,'''All the information in the world has been pretty dispersed, but Google's mission has been to organize it and make it universally accessible.''' ,'''I'm not bothered when other VCs start hiring great designers or start recruiting. That's the direction I'd like it to go.''' ,'''Government is really successful when it's willing to make big, bold objectives, like, 'We're going to get to the moon.' But without leaders with big ideas, we get stuck.''' ,'''As computer intelligence gets better, what will be possible when we interface our brains with computers? It might sound scary, but early evidence suggests otherwise: interfacing brains with machines can be helpful in treating traumatic brain injury, repairing spinal cord damage, and countless other applications.''' ,'''Organizing healthcare information is a daunting task, but it is not an impossible task. We've had people walk on the moon. This is a lot more doable.''' ,'''Antibiotics are so pervasive that they are often prescribed preemptively, as soon as patients report symptoms, before a diagnosis is made.''' ,'''When you build relationships with entrepreneurs, they're not trying to optimize on price.''' ,'''With a regular venture fund, you raise, let's say, a billion dollars, and then over the next three or four years, you've got to invest that money; otherwise, the people who invested with you will say, 'What are you doing? You're just collecting fees on our money.'''' ,'''There are a number of start-ups in Europe that are able to reach beyond their own country. Take Spotify - Spotify just in Sweden isn't that interesting compared to Spotify all over the world.''' ,'''VC firms are... responsible for the full life cycle of a company: they find it, help it grow, open up a Rolodex, and sell it.''' ,'''The reality is regulation often lags behind innovation.''' ,'''If I were to leave and raise a venture fund, I would have to find 10 or 100 LPs. They would all give me a bunch of money, and I would take a percentage of that to pay myself. They would expect me to invest that over the next three years, and they want that money back in seven or eight years.''' ,'''You make a great investment in the consumer Internet, maybe you make a lot of money and create something useful, interesting, or fun. But in life sciences, you have a chance to be part of something that lets people live longer and healthier and not lose the people they care about. That is really profound.''' ,'''There are a lot of billionaires in Silicon Valley, but in the end, we are all heading to the same place. If given the choice between making a lot of money or finding a way to make people live longer, what do you choose?''' ,'''I would draw a really big distinction between competition, or potential competition, and a conflict of interest. A conflict of interest implies wrongdoing, whereas competition is really healthy.''' ,'''To create exponential growth in health care, we need to put tremendous resources and focus behind the best human minds working in this field.''' ,'''We have this powerful lever at Google Ventures, which is to invest $200 million a year. This is a huge lever. It's not all going into one place; it's going into lots of start ups and founders and entrepreneurs, all of which are levers to try and change the world in one way or another.''' ,'''I'm interested in the ideas that sound a little crazy, such as radical life extension, curing cancer, being able to create a simulation of the human brain and map every neuron.''' ,'''You want to work with people you are excited about and they are excited about you. It's a two-way street.''' ,'''During the 2000 bubble, many companies rushed to go public before they had any revenue.''' ,'''We're looking for people who are working on things that seem out of reach, uncomfortably difficult.''' ,]
