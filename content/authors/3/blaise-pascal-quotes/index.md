How can a part know the whole?''' ,'''When we see a natural style, we are astonished and charmed; for we expected to see an author, and we find a person.''' ,'''The eternal silence of these infinite spaces frightens me.''' ,'''Nothing fortifies scepticism more than the fact that there are some who are not sceptics; if all were so, they would be wrong.''' ,'''Too much and too little wine. Give him none, he cannot find truth; give him too much, the same.''' ,'''Thus so wretched is man that he would weary even without any cause for weariness... and so frivolous is he that, though full of a thousand reasons for weariness, the least thing, such as playing billiards or hitting a ball, is sufficient enough to amuse him.''' ,'''Can anything be stupider than that a man has the right to kill me because he lives on the other side of a river and his ruler has a quarrel with mine, though I have not quarrelled with him?''' ,'''People are generally better persuaded by the reasons which they have themselves discovered than by those which have come in to the mind of others.''' ,'''We conceal it from ourselves in vain - we must always love something. In those matters seemingly removed from love, the feeling is secretly to be found, and man cannot possibly live for a moment without it.''' ,'''Reason commands us far more imperiously than a master; for in disobeying the one we are unfortunate, and in disobeying the other we are fools.''' ,'''The heart has its reasons of which reason knows nothing.''' ,'''Men never do evil so completely and cheerfully as when they do it from religious conviction.''' ,'''Noble deeds that are concealed are most esteemed.''' ,'''Small minds are concerned with the extraordinary, great minds with the ordinary.''' ,'''I have discovered that all human evil comes from this, man's being unable to sit still in a room.''' ,'''Nothing gives rest but the sincere search for truth.''' ,'''We view things not only from different sides, but with different eyes; we have no wish to find them alike.''' ,'''Continuous eloquence wearies. Grandeur must be abandoned to be appreciated. Continuity in everything is unpleasant. Cold is agreeable, that we may get warm.''' ,'''Concupiscence and force are the source of all our actions; concupiscence causes voluntary actions, force involuntary ones.''' ,'''The weather and my mood have little connection. I have my foggy and my fine days within me; my prosperity or misfortune has little to do with the matter.''' ,'''Nature is an infinite sphere of which the center is everywhere and the circumference nowhere.''' ,'''Faith certainly tells us what the senses do not, but not the contrary of what they see; it is above, not against them.''' ,'''Chance gives rise to thoughts, and chance removes them; no art can keep or acquire them.''' ,'''The immortality of the soul is a matter which is of so great consequence to us and which touches us so profoundly that we must have lost all feeling to be indifferent about it.''' ,'''We only consult the ear because the heart is wanting.''' ,'''Belief is a wise wager.

There is nothing so conformable to reason as this disavowal of reason.''' ,'''If we must not act save on a certainty, we ought not to act on religion, for it is not certain. But how many things we do on an uncertainty, sea voyages, battles!''' ,'''Human beings must be known to be loved; but Divine beings must be loved to be known.''' ,'''Men blaspheme what they do not know.''' ,'''If all men knew what others say of them, there would not be four friends in the world.''' ,'''Little things console us because little things afflict us.''' ,'''All of our reasoning ends in surrender to feeling.''' ,'''The knowledge of God is very far from the love of Him.''' ,'''The strength of a man's virtue should not be measured by his special exertions, but by his habitual acts.''' ,'''Do you wish people to think well of you? Don't speak well of yourself.''' ,'''Men despise religion. They hate it and are afraid it may be true.''' ,'''Vanity of science. Knowledge of physical science will not console me for ignorance of morality in time of affliction, but knowledge of morality will always console me for ignorance of physical science.''' ,'''Eloquence is a painting of the thoughts.''' ,'''Justice and truth are too such subtle points that our tools are too blunt to touch them accurately.''' ,'''It is not good to be too free.

It is above them and not contrary to them.''' ,'''Jesus is the God whom we can approach without pride and before whom we can humble ourselves without despair.''' ,'''I can well conceive a man without hands, feet, head.
