- Memo to Congress: America's problem is not that government is too small. It's the spending, stupid!

- Americans are paying for our lack of an energy policy with their jobs and out of their pocketbooks.

- Education is a shared commitment between dedicated teachers, motivated students and enthusiastic parents with high expectations.
- When the American people elected Barack Obama and large Democrat majorities, the die was cast. ObamaCare was coming. Popular or not, constitutional or not, affordable or not, it didn't matter.

- I can't help but recall my dad and mom. Depression era kids, 8th and 9th grade educations, clawed and scratched to make a living as dairy farmers their whole life. At least two drought cycles nearly took it all away. They just worked harder, longer... and they made it.
