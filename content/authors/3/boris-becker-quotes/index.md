- I go to London, my favourite city in the world, and I feel at home.

- The eyes of some of the fans at Davis Cup matches scare me. There's no light in them. Fixed emotions. Blind worship. Horror. It makes me think of what happened to us long ago.
- I believe that everything in life happens for a reason.
- So this is it. Match point for eternity.
- The suit-and-tie job is very nice but it's not really who I am in my heart.

- If I go into a club now, all the blonde girls leave my corner and all the black girls come into my corner. It's as if I'm racist towards white girls!

- Girls had never been important. I'd had a girlfriend or two and had liked them a lot but it wasn't love, because my first love was tennis.

- Tennis is a psychological sport, you have to keep a clear head. That is why I stopped playing.
- Does anyone ask their parents how they are conceived?
- I can't change history, I don't want to change history. I can only change the future. I'm working on that.
- How do you build a relationship when you've hardly shared a word but suddenly share a child? How do you love a daughter you don't see for nearly two years? When does she become your daughter? How does she become your daughter?
- When you are thrown onto the stage at 17 in such an enormous way, it becomes living on the edge because every step you take, every word you speak, every action you do becomes headline news. And it became, for me, life or death.
- I don't know how many millions of photographs have been taken of me.
- I go to my favourite tournament, I talk about my favourite sport and it's just a great month of parading.
- For a year, I had all sorts of weirdos coming on to me.
- When I was a child, I had posters of James Dean in my room. I was a big admirer of his work and was fascinated by him living on the edge. Looking back, my life was kind of the same.
- An autobiography is not about pictures; it's about the stories; it's about honesty and as much truth as you can tell without coming too close to other people's privacy.

- I want to be a hero, a small and good kind of hero, even though I know heroes have very short lives.
- I don't really care what the man on the street thinks. I never did anything to please him in the first place, and I'm not going to start now.
- I lost in the second round of the French Open and had 10 days off. I went to the Hard Rock Cafe. It was exciting to be away from my parents, to stay in a hotel. Hotels at 17 meant freedom.
- It's silly to say it about a tennis player, but I'm an unbelievable hero in Germany. And Germany needs heroes more than any place.
