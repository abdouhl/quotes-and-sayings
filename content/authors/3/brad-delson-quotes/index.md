- 'Music for Relief' has played a vital role in helping get aid to people who most need it. We are deeply honored to participate in what will likely be our biggest event to date.
- With so many amazing artists on one bill, we expect this concert to be incredibly powerful in its ability to raise both money and awareness for the long-term rebuilding effort we must all support.
- We're resolving our differences and we're looking forward to putting out a record next year.
- I'm inspired by the sheer ingenuity and intelligence possessed by my fellow band mates.
- In fact, I want to be a Transformer as an adult. I would transform into a Gulf Stream 500.
- People think when you get a record deal all your problems will go away. We know that the bigger we get, the more problems we'll have. I guess Puff Daddy was somewhat - what's the word? - prophetic in that respect.
- Yeah, I always listen to both classic and newer folk-influenced music. Singer-songwriter, alternative music. I also listen to more experimental dance music.
- The biggest misconception about us is that we're just a rock band. We think our music is a cross-section of many genres; a hybrid of what the six of us have grown up on.
- I just did an interview where I was asked whether I drink beer or whisky, and I was sad to reveal that I'm pounding spring water.
- I was a big Transformers fan.
- Each album has its own cycle. We wanted to capture all those feelings and moments for this touring cycle.
