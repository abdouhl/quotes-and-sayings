L .James doesn't think I'm being a prankster. I really want to adapt her novels for the screen. Christian Grey is a writer's dream.''' ,'''I feel like I'm not smart enough to answer the questions I'm asked.''' ,'''I had no idea that 'Less Than Zero' was going to be read by anyone outside of Los Angeles, and it's - believe me, as the writer of the book I'm somewhat amused and intrigued by the idea that 25 years later it's still out and people are still reading it.''' ,'''Unless you're the director on the movie, or putting up the money for the movie, you really don't have a lot of control.''' ,'''I totally relate to Tom Cruise. He's not crazy, it's just the litany of the mid-life crisis.''' ,'''Completely committed to adapting 'Fifty Shades of Grey'. This is not a joke.

I think it's a medium that really is built for the male gaze and for a male sensibility.''' ,'''I think basically most men are misogynistic.''' ,'''Are you as much of a criminal if you don't act when there's a crime taking place in front of you as you are one of the participants? That was something that I was thinking about a lot because there are many moments in 'Less Than Zero' where horrific things happen and Clay could do something about them, but his passivity stops him.''' ,'''Why would I care what other people are thinking? I don't care what an audience thinks of me.''' ,'''It's the rare book that's able to transport you in a way that a movie does.''' ,'''No one is drawn to writing about being happy or feelings of joy.''' ,'''I think my sensibility is very literary; all my books were built as books, and I wasn't thinking about them being movies.''' ,'''If I want to write a movie, I'll write a screenplay, but if I have an idea for a book, it's something that I think can only be done novelistically.''' ,'''I have no problems or issues with screenwriting in general.''' ,]
