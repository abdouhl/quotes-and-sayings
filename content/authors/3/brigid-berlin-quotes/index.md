- There are two things that I hate: getting up at 6 in the morning and making my bed. I'm as neat as a pin, but I will not make beds. Period. I don't care if I get into them and they're messy. I just don't care.
- I love the New York that was. The end for me was Studio 54. I don't go out at night anymore.
- My father was the president of the Hearst Corporation, and my parents were close friends of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, and they all had pugs.
- The terrible thing about sunlight is it shows the dirt.
- I loathe having to go out and get dressed up. I'd much rather stay home and watch CNN.
- I consider myself the queen of pugs of New York City. I'm really into my dogs. Massive pugs, massive needlepoint, massive color!
