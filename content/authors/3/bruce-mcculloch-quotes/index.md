- I would rather be a security guard than a rock star.
- I like to do little obsessed losers, or people who are in over their head, or people who are trying to figure stuff out, or guys whose girlfriends leave them and they don't quite get it. Guys who just don't quite get it.
- But we wanted to work in a way we never had, which was write everything together. We had to face each other in the same creative room, which gets tougher as you get older, because you don't want to be confrontational.
- L.A. Woman is amazing, but when I was growing up I was into the Who.
- I, sir, I just like to work. I'm humble.
- I don't love comedy but I can watch someone who's kind of interesting forever. I think a waitress who's having a bad day is a lot more fun than Robin Williams doing forty minutes of material.

- I think you're the grumpy Kid in the Hall, I'm the nice Kid in the Hall.
- However, we couldn't focus on the films much during the series because we're dumb. Individually we're smart guys, but together we're one big dumb guy, and couldn't concentrate on two things at once.
- I'm just ah, actually developing a tv show for HBO, and I'm directing a film this summer, and actually I'm doing some live shows out in western Canada.
- I got through college realizing business was repugnant.
- Cancer Boy probably has the saddest, noblest, sweetest heart of any character I've ever done.
- I think that's why I like baseball. There's something great about it - you're young, the pitcher's young and he's got this great arm, and he doesn't really realize anything about strategy.
- We see less of Dave, certainly, and he's kind of fallen out of the sphere of our group, mostly because he's working on his show, and has kind of lost the fun of the party.
- Yeah, we're sweet but savage, and I think a lot of Canadians are that way.
- No, I don't run all the way. I'm not like an Olympic class runner.
