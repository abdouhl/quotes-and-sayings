- As humans our hangups seem to shape our interaction with the world around us. They are often the source of our intolerance and friction with people who think differently than us, and even the reason we build walls between us and the people close to us.
- You've got to earn it; you're not just handed anything in life. That's why no one starts out as a perfect master.
- We just don't subscribe to the conventional wisdom that you can't have an action series led by a female character. It's kinda nonsense to us.
- Of course, Mike and I debate and argue - we used to play Ping-Pong to settle arguments. But then Mike got really good.
- As we wrote 'Book 1,' before the audience had ever laid eyes on Korra and Asami, it was an idea I would kick around the writers' room... The more Korra and Asami's relationship progressed, the more the idea of a romance between them organically blossomed for us.
- Mike and I figured out a lot about the world, characters and story in the initial two weeks between creating 'Avatar' and pitching it to Nickelodeon.
- We feel like we're kind of movie guys working in TV. So we're looking forward to that day when we get to work in that medium.
- I am certainly proud to add 'Korra' to the pantheon of TV characters, which is perpetually sorely lacking in multifaceted female characters who aren't sidekicks, subordinates or mere trophies for male characters.
- 'Korra' is its own series. Obviously it's tied in, in the same world, a similar story, but it's not just 'Book Four' of 'The Last Airbender.'
- Korra and Aang ultimately stand for freedom, equality, and basic human rights, and I think Mike and I are fine with pushing that agenda.
- Aang was an airbending prodigy, but didn't even discover he could bend the other three elements on his own; whereas Korra was bending three of the elements at age four.
- While we were in the middle of 'Avatar' we got a lot of volatile reaction from fans. They were very upset with the direction we were taking Zuko.
- 'Avatar' means so many things to so many different people. When I think of the creation of it, I think of me and Mike at the computer in a little apartment in Burbank.
- Definitely female MMA fighters, I'm a big mixed martial arts fan, and watching women's MMA grow was definitely an inspiration. We just had an idea for a character and wanted to do a personality that was the opposite of Aang's, and that's how Korra came about.
- We don't dwell on the business of Korra restoring everyone's bending in 'Book 2,' but we figured she got around to helping the innocent people who lost it in the months between the seasons.
- When Nickelodeon, in 2009, told us they wanted us to come back and do another series where we could do whatever we wanted, the first thought we had was: Let's do a story about the next 'Avatar.' That was the first thought. The second thought was: Let's make it a girl.
- I try to make the kinds of things I want to see out there in the world, and hope they end up resonating with other people too.
- It's hard to surprise people with everything leaking on the Internet.
- I always feel pressure, no matter what I do! I think it is what gets me up in the morning.
- Animation is incredibly difficult - much like doing a giant sweeping fantasy novel.
- Hopefully, when we're done with the 'Korra' saga we can put our stamp on a movie.
- When I watch a show, I want to feel like it is coming out of someone's head, not out of a boardroom.
- I think it's touching that the fans feel so close to the characters that they feel personally hurt. I've felt that way in plenty of TV shows - 'Game of Thrones,' 'Mad Men.' How could they do that to that character? That's drama.
- We have always put the quest for balance at the center of our storytelling, whether it is the struggle to find it within one character, between a character and society, between disparate cultures or between humans and their environment.
- Early on, many years ago when we started 'Avatar,' the executive that we were working with said to make the sad scenes sadder, the funny scenes funnier, the scary scenes scarier. That was kind of permission to do what we felt comfortable with.
- After 'Avatar' ended, I spent a lot of time watching MMA and kickboxing fights on UFC, WEC, DREAM, and K-1.
- Some Nickelodeon executives were worried about backing an animated action show with a female lead character. Conventional TV wisdom has it that girls will watch shows about boys, but boys won't watch shows about girls. During test screenings, though, boys said they didn't care that Korra was a girl. They just said she was awesome.
- I thought Korra was 17 so Mike and I have to get our stories straight. The main characters are in their late teens, we've always loved those kind of teen love triangle type stories and there was plenty of that in the original series.
- Mike and I like a balance of tones. We never set out to make an overtly silly show or an overly serious dramatic show.
- Any political or philosophical agenda can and will be perverted by power and/or fear.
- There is such a flood of TV shows, movies, video games, comics, and books, but somehow 'Avatar' is still being discovered by each new generation.
- We draw inspiration directly and indirectly from all sorts of things, like movies, documentaries, TV dramas, novels, non-fiction books, animation, science and nature shows, and our own life experiences.
- Fans are more interested in imagining relationships between a myriad of pairings. But they're profoundly disinterested in seeing any of those things manifest themselves on the show.
- The social and political climate came from discussions about how we could find conflict in the wake of a 100-year-long war ending. But as we know in the real world, just because a war ends it doesn't mean that everything turns happy and peaceful. That provided us with some new kinds of conflict for us to explore in 'Korra.'
- I like nothing more than a character sacrificing himself or herself for the sake of others. That's drama at its finest for me.
- That's been the case for decades. 'The Simpsons,' 'King of the Hill' - they do the preproduction in America, and the production is in Korea or in some cases China, or occasionally Japan or India.
- We knew we wanted the 'magic' in our show to be different than the typical wand-wielding spell-casting fare. For us, it had to be natural and physical, with a source and rules and limitations - and most importantly it had to be a skill rather than just a power, something that a practitioner had to learn and strive for.
- From the inception of this series, Mike and I were very interested in exploring the theme of tradition versus progress. We always like the struggle for balance to be a central theme of our stories, so as we introduce all of these changes to the 'Avatar' world, we get to see how people react and try to realign themselves.
- Book 4 is the end of the 'Korra' series. So we've got 52 episodes planned. When all is said and done it will have taken I think about five years to make.
- With 'Korra' we've really taken a lot of time to craft it. We're aiming pretty high, and in order to keep up the quality it just takes a lot of time and a lot or work.
- It is a long story how we finally ended up with the title simply being 'The Legend of Korra,' but in a poetic way, I think Korra's big Type A personality willed it to happen!
- We're always striving to make Avatar look like a cinematic, live-action movie.
- Though we did have a few main characters in 'Avatar' who represented the non-benders of the world, most of the people we focused on were benders. However, benders are the minority in their world population.
- We really liked the magic of 'Harry Potter' and 'The Lord of the Rings,' but we could never figure out where the powers came from.
- We're definitely still interested in the Avatar/Korra universe and fantastical world building in general, but I think many of the core themes and tones found in our two kids' series would be present as well in any sort of adult dramas we might be lucky enough to make in the future.
- I always felt like Azula and Long Feng were much more interesting villains and three-dimensional characters than Ozai, who was just sort of a big jerk. Like a really big jerk, but not very complex or human.
- Mike and I were really interested in other epic 'Legends & Lore' properties, like 'Harry Potter' and 'Lord of the Rings,' but we knew that we wanted to take a different approach to that type of genre. Our love for Japanese Anime, Hong Kong action & Kung Fu cinema, yoga, and Eastern philosophies led us to the initial inspiration for 'Avatar.'
- It wouldn't be the Avatarverse without some hairstyle changes, now would it?
- The 'Korra' crew were like a family, and they're so unbelievably talented and dedicated, and got along so well.
- We want our villains and antagonists to have distinct motivations.
- When you have a fully-realized Avatar, it's like Superman, and how do you make that interesting?
- We wanted the elemental 'bending' to be based on authentic Chinese traditional martial arts, believing this would lend a beauty and resonance to the animation and the fictitious disciplines. Once we had that idea, I started looking for a Kung Fu teacher/Martial Arts consultant. My search led me to Sifu Kisu and I began training with him right away.
- I think Mike and I would absolutely love to do feature animation. Either another story, or it if worked out, one in the 'Avatar' world. We would be really excited.
- Nickelodeon came to us at the end of 2009 with a twelve episode 'mini-season' already green-lit for a new series. They let us do pretty much whatever we wanted with it, as long as it was in the 'Avatar' universe and featured bending.
- I'm just making 'Threadworlds' out of the things I love and that I'm passionate about learning. When we created 'Avatar,' Michael DiMartino and I did the same thing.
- It seems to me virtually any ideology, no matter how intrinsically benign, can be used to oppress. And any group with power, no matter how well-meaning, ultimately corrupts and ends up exploiting its advantage to some extent.
- I think Korra, I later realized she was inspired by my sister, who is pretty tough.
- In a lot of ways, their journeys are opposite of each other's: Aang was a peace-loving monk, through and through, whereas Korra is a dyed in the wool fighter.
- Stories often take their own course once you start to write them, especially when you have the benefit of a writers' room and a team of people augmenting and adding to the material.
- Since the first announcement of 'Korra' a few years ago, our fan presence online has just been huge and it's really active online. And as TV distribution evolves, even between 'Book 1' and 'Book 2,' it's evolved even more, our audience is increasingly online.
- Mike and I are always drawn to the idea that there is light and dark inside every being, rather than the old two-dimensional trope of good versus evil.
- In an early version of the story, I thought Aang could shepherd a herd of twenty bison.
- I am infamous for writing fight scenes beat for beat, punch for punch. I can't help it!
- I'll just say that America - us included - has a long way to go to catch up with the animated work being done in a handful of countries, namely Japan.
- I just follow what inspires me as an artist and a storyteller, and stay true to myself in my work.
