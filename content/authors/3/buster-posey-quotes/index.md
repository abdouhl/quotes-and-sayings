- The way that I was taught to play baseball, and to me the way baseball has always been, is... Look, we play 162 games. It's a grinding, hard-nosed game. And even when I was a kid it was about not showing up your opponent. It was about playing the game with class. But, obviously I think you should have fun doing it.

- Hopefully I'm somebody the guys can look at and say, 'He goes about things the right way.'
