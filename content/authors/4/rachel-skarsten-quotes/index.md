- Every reality show plot pales in comparison to our history.
- While I deeply admire actors who deeply prepare, it's just not something I do.
- I always like to look at things and think, 'Would I be proud to bring my grandma and grandpa to come see me in this?' And if I wouldn't want them to see it, then it's not something that I should immortalize myself on film in.
- I've been through periods where I haven't worked and would have paid someone to give me a job - I think that's really helped me feel very grateful to have a job, even when I have a call time of 3:30 A.M. My mom laughs when I text at 4 A.M saying, 'I love my job.'
- The special thing about 'Lost Girl' is it can be campy at times, but the show doesn't take itself too seriously, which is what separates it from other sci-fi TV shows. I love that.
- I'm no stranger to joining a show in the third season. I joined 'Lost Girl' at the same stage, and that was a wonderful experience.
- Normally, learning lines is fairly easy for me, but when you add an accent onto that, it adds a complexity that I had not anticipated.
