- When the time is right I have a laugh and a joke with my friends on a day off, but I have had to make sacrifices, and in that sense it's been a huge step forward, completely different to how it was before. I was 18 when the manager spoke to me. I realised I'm not like any other teenager. I can't be doing stuff any other 18 or 19-year-old was doing.
- I would never want the fans to think bad of me, to think I just want as much money for myself.
- Sometimes you can get sloppy and control the ball right at your feet, and that gives the defenders a chance.
- When I got the ball in the reserves, within two touches I would turn and look to attack my opponent, whereas in the first team, I was trying for the safer option. I needed to go back to basics. I needed to get defenders on the back foot again.
- I was looking at the sights, thinking, 'I used to play there a couple of years back, and now I'm on the coach with the England team.'
- For a few years, we lived with our grandmother in Kingston, and I remember watching the other kids with their mums and just feeling really jealous. I didn't fully understand what my mum was doing for us. I just knew that she was gone. My grandma was amazing, but everybody wants their mum at that age.
- One of my friends, Bruno Andrade, was so quick, he just used to knock the ball past whoever he was playing against, and I thought, 'Why can't I do that?' Until then, I would try to dribble and maybe try a stepover, but Andre would just knock it then - beep, beep - and he was so fast, he would get there first.
- The fans get a bit frustrated with me because I'm not signing straight away. They can get on your back a little bit, but this is football, and you have to accept these things.
- Some things that started in pre-season and then, you know what, the season gets started, you kind of forget about it and then move on to football, and it's strictly football until the season finishes.
- I put a lot of pressure on myself to do well and score more, and it will be a matter of time. Once you get back into that rhythm, you will start getting balls that drop to you in positions where it wasn't before. I do have that feeling that it is going to come soon.
- It's always an honor to put on an England shirt, but this one is different - it makes you really feel fast; plus, it's light and fits nicely.
- I try to get better in every aspect of my life, not just on the football field. I am competitive, and I just want to always get better.
- I don't talk about how many cars I'm going to drive, how many houses I've got. I just purely want to be the best I can be.
- If you don't score, what happens? You sulk on the bus the whole way back.
- It's never been about money. I talk about winning trophies throughout my career. That's all I talk about.
- Every player wants to win the World Cup - every country wants to win the World Cup - so anything less than that is not really a bonus. Of course you can take positives out of everything, but you won't be entirely happy if you don't win it.
- I am always analysing myself; I am always critical of myself and always trying to improve.
- If you want your country to do well as everyone says, bring a positive light to it.
- Before I went to Liverpool, I was a striker and then sometimes a No. 8 or No. 10, and my thing was shooting, finishing, and long-distance shots.
- I grew up five minutes from the stadium and watched it being built. I'd play football right outside and look up at this huge stadium with all the cranes and building work and think, 'One day, when it's finished, I need to be playing in here.'

- I just want to be seen as a kid who loves to play football and to do the best for the team.
- A better goals-to-game ratio is the aim for me now. If you score goals, you will get people talking about you.

- I've come to a point in my career where it doesn't matter if I dribble or nutmeg someone. The only thing that matters is whether I was decisive, did I put the ball in the back of the net today, and did it help the team win.
- My mum was working as a cleaner at some hotels to make extra money so she could pay for her degree. I'll never forget waking up at five in the morning before school and helping her clean the toilets at the hotel in Stonebridge.
- Performing for my dad does drive me on. Especially in big games, massive games.
- I remember being coached at Liverpool, and there was another kid called Toni Silva, and they said, 'You know, instead of blasting the ball, and it goes in, do like Toni does: pass it around the keeper.'
- I've learned how to deal with pressure more. I'm still trying to achieve more in my game and add more to it. I feel like I'm still learning every day, and I want to keep on improving.
- My mum thinks she knows her football. She'll certainly tell me when I'm not doing something right. At other times, she'll say I'm not listening to her. There's been a few clashes with her.
- It's something I've always wanted to do: wear the number 10 for England.
- If I lose the ball, I want to get on it as quickly as possible and make up for it, whereas before, I would hide away and maybe only look for the ball 10 minutes later. I don't want to give the defenders any break.
- I am not saying I don't think I'm good, but I'm not the type of player to have an ego or big myself up.
- That's the one thing I don't like hearing, when someone says, 'We'll see what happens, see what happens here, see what happens there.' Forget all of that.

- I just want to take the time to think about what I've achieved in my career so far, where I need to go, and what I need to do to get better as a player.
- I don't want to be the one that says Liverpool can go on and win the league. But there's a real belief and togetherness in the squad; we're all working for each other. We all know what the dream is at the end of it.
- I'm trying to make the box, trying to be more ruthless, more clinical, and trying to decide games.

- I've just got face: he looks like a brat. The 'I don't like face.' That's how I see it. And I'm not a brat. Sometimes I'm watching a movie, and you see a character and go, 'I don't like him' - that's me.
- I'm a person, when something's not going right, I'm looking at myself and seeing how I can improve and what I can do better.
- I'm sorry to say it, but we have to be more arrogant and more streetwise because we are coming up against some great teams who have that streetwise mentality. They bring their play into it: you do what you have to do to win a game. Simple as that. Be streetwise and clever.

- If people want to write about my mum's bathroom in her house, all I have to tell you is that 15 years ago, we were cleaning toilets in Stonebridge and getting breakfast out of the vending machine. If anybody deserves to be happy, it's my mum.
- Goals can help lift me to be one of the best two or three in the world, most definitely. You score the goal that wins the football match five, six, seven times a season: you are one of the best in the world. And that's what I need to do. I need to keep being consistent.
- England is still a place where a naughty boy who comes from nothing can live his dream.

- Make the boys go off to the World Cup with a clear head, that everyone is behind them and everyone is with them, and trust me: I think you would definitely see a better England.
