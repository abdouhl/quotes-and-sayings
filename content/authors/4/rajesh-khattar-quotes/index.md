quotes = ['''I am extremely frustrated with my son Ishaan Khattar being referred to as 'Kapur' time and again in the media. I am anguished and feel helpless.''' ,'''My foundation in acting has been serious theatre: Albert Camus, Arthur Miller, Shakespeare. It's really the best medium to learn the craft.''' ,'''As voiceover artistes, we don't transcribe; we translate. One has to communicate what the character is feeling, and introduce humour where needed with a regional flavour that the audience can relate to.''' ,'''Emotions have a way of transcending geographies and cultures and hence I don't think that an Indian woman is any different from a Turkish woman.''' ,'''I was fortunate enough to work with legends like Hrishikesh Mukherjee, Basu Chatterjee, Vijay Anand and Yash Chopra, and contemporary filmmakers like Farhan Akhtar and Karan Johar.''' ,'''It's very important that your kids get to do what they want to, and not what you want them to do.''' ,'''For me, becoming a father at 50-plus was another challenge, but then, I am neither the first one, nor the last in this category.''' ,'''I have done almost 100 movies and given voice over for almost all Hollywood stars.''' ,'''I am a staunch believer that every child is born with his own destiny and I would want to do everything possible for my kids for as long as I am around.''' ,'''Like I say, every child is born with his or her destiny; what he does with it is what matters.''' ,'''Star voices are not cheap. So if they're not bringing the desired result for the studio, why not pay the VO artists better.''' ,'''Acting can happen in cinema, on television, on stage.''' ,'''Well, honestly, I give my best to every role, be it good or bad.''' ,'''With Netflix here, more shows will be dubbed to reach as many as eyeballs as possible.''' ,'''Dubbing has become big now with dubbed versions of 'Baahubali' doing so well.''' ,'''After a time, all children have to be on their own. Though as parents you always want to cushion them, however, when life throws new challenges, they have to take their own calls.''' ,'''The big difference lies in the pay cheque and the billing in the credits. I have been voicing for a decade, and if you don't get good billing, it does hurt.''' ,'''I've got my fair share of appreciation, and I've definitely grown as an actor, but I never expected to be an icon.''' ,'''After acting for four years, in five languages, theatre became my stepping stone to TV and cinema.''' ,'''My son Ishaan's passion for movies and his exposure to world cinema infuses me with optimism.''' ,'''Try finding a better villain than me. I am the best of the worst!''' ,'''People appreciate those who've enabled them to watch highly entertaining movies by demolishing the language barrier.''' ,'''You are a star only when the public accepts you, and it doesn't matter where you are coming from, and what kind of a launch you are getting - everyone has to begin somewhere.''' ,'''Studios tend to approach popular actors because they want to grab eyeballs. When it comes to the south actors, this may work because they cater to a different kind of audience, and it might make a difference there. However, in the Hindi film space, having a famous name only works in specific cases.''' ,'''Ishaan looks up to Shahid. When Shahid started his career Ishaan was a child.''' ,'''I would never give a piece of advice whether it is a personal or professional one as I don't believe in it.''' ,'''While acting with Amitabh Bachchan, the legend of Hindi cinema, and superstars like Shah Rukh Khan, Ajay Devgn and Akshay Kumar, I observed how they interpret cinema and make it an experience to cherish for their audiences.''' ,'''A lot of nepotism that exists, actually, exists outside this industry because in this industry, behind the camera a director's son becomes a director and a producer's son becomes a producer and that is still understandable that they are carrying their legacy but for actors, it is very very different.''' ,'''It is foolish to compare Shahid and Ishaan. Shahid has made it on his own. So will Ishaan. He did not get a Majid Majidi film because he is Shahid Kapoor's brother.''' ,'''Getting a random star whose voice is not the right fit for the character but simply adds star value is avoidable as that can actually irk the audience.''' ,]
