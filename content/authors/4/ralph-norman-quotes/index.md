Nobody, I think, sees that or would agree with that.''' ,'''I got into politics because businessmen should be spending your money.''' ,'''Our message of a balanced budget amendment, term limits to end career politicians, and a real plan to keep America safe is resonating with voters.''' ,'''Everybody's had their differences with President Trump. He's a polarizing president, but I think a majority of the people like what he's doing.''' ,'''My one issue in this country is to get on a firm financial footing. There's not much you can do if you're bankrupt.''' ,'''John Spratt did a great job of constituent service. When somebody had a problem, he would jump on it. The reason I ran against him was that he was one way in the district and then when he got to Washington, he voted the opposite.''' ,'''I believe in the free enterprise system.''' ,'''If you liked Mick Mulvaney's votes, you'll like my votes.''' ,]
