- I don't think there are too many traditional media guys who really understood what the new digital media is about.
- I have been reorganizing and restructuring AOL: changing the strategy and rebuilding it from scratch in the worst economy in a generation.
- I speak the language of television.
- Televisa is the largest media company in the Spanish-speaking world, and the steps we have taken, which extend the tenure of our exclusive access to Televisa's premium Spanish-language telenovelas, sports, sitcoms, reality series, news programs and feature films, put Univision in a stronger competitive position.
- I'm very involved with all the executives at Televisa.
- Having spent two years at AOL, I would love to be able to go back to that industry knowing what I know, and I think I would be able to help the traditional media side to better understand what is coming at them, how to deal with it.
- I made the decision to end business relationships with the Trump Organization simply because it was the right thing to do. No one approached me, asked me or pressured me to take this action.
- What drew me to this job is that Univision is a brand unlike any other in all of media. Univision has the highest brand affinity of any brand, and that includes Microsoft and Apple and some of the iconic brands in all of industry.
- My job was to turn the company around and to give Time Warner a profitable Web business to spin off and a profitable access business that still throws off a tremendous amount of cash. I can check both of those boxes. I am done, and I feel good about what we've accomplished.
- The biggest segment of our audience is 18 to 34, and, believe it or not, they still speak Spanish, and they still watch novellas and soccer games and news.
- Engagement means that in the future there will be a lot more ways for our audience to interact with Univision content.
- What I'm concerned about is making sure that every single time somebody who grew up with us goes off to a different platform or a different device, we're going to be there with a Univision-branded product of some kind.
- The key measurement will not be how many people are watching the Univision network. But, believe me, I still think we are going to grow and are shooting for No. 1, and that spot is certainly on our radar. But engagement will be the focus and the main measure.
- Put simply, my vision for AOL is to build the largest and most sophisticated global advertising network while we grow the size and engagement of our worldwide audience.
- Univision is the only network where you pay for more, not for less.
- I have long admired Univision - a pioneer in the industry - and recognized the tremendous potential and influence of the burgeoning U.S. Hispanic population.
- I don't speak Spanish. I understand enough of it, having spent some time running Telemundo, and I put in a lot of time in Spain during the Barcelona Olympics. But I don't pretend to speak Spanish, and I don't want anyone to think that I can.
- The heart of Univision - and what we do - is here in Miami.
- Univision's close-to-50-year relationship with Hispanics makes us one of the leading media brands in this country and the gateway to connect with this consumer.
- As a presidential candidate, Mr. Trump is going to get tough questions from the press and has to answer them.
- I look forward to working alongside Univision's exceptional team as we work to further realize the substantial growth potential of this dynamic organization.
- The Hispanic culture is finding its way into the American culture. Places like Miami are going to be centers for that influence - places like Los Angeles and, certainly, cities in Texas.
- Back in 1975, we were making all the decisions about what people were going to watch.
- The Hispanic population in this country is not a monolith. When you're in Miami, the newscast is going to be different from the newscast in Los Angeles.
