But in the U.S., people don't understand it. You get odd looks or doors slammed in your face.''' ,'''When you turn up for work, especially with looking down the barrel of a show, you're hoping the person you're acting opposite of is going to be on your kind of crazy wavelength.''' ,'''I think fidelity is absolutely important, especially in the acting industry, which is littered with broken relationships because people are away filming for months.''' ,''''Homeland' is not a sensationalist show.''' ,]
