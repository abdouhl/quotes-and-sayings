If you want to see it is poetry, you can, and if you don't, you can watch a fun cartoon.''' ,'''I love comics. Comics are something I've always wanted to do.''' ,'''I love thinking of cartoon characters feeling really real feelings. And I love to do that, not just as a fan, but as a creator, so if people want to look for those levels, they're actually there.''' ,'''I find pop art really offensive because it's taking a piece of popular culture and putting it somewhere where people can't see it.''' ,'''I'm really inspired by the show 'Future Boy Conan' from the '70s. It's a really beautiful show, and I love shonen anime and shojo anime, and I like the thought of mixing them together.''' ,'''I was a really big fan of cartoons growing up, and I loved to read too much into them most of the time.''' ,'''You can't wait for someone to give you a show.
