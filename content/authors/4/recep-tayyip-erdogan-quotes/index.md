A Muslim and a Christian name - so in his name there is a synthesis, although people from time to time want to overlook that, and they do it intentionally.''' ,'''All terror groups are bad, and we shall fight them all.''' ,'''A lasting solution to this problem will have an exceptionally positive influence foremost on the peoples of Palestine and Israel, as well as on the region and the international community.''' ,'''Why shouldn't Turkey be in the Shanghai Five?''' ,'''The purpose cannot be creating self-styled democracies, but rather encouraging steps that are conducive to establishing democratic rule at universal standards.
