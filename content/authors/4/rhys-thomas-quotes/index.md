quotes = ['''There is a little bit of snobbery with casting, and unless you're a really successful comedian like Ruth Jones, you don't get to be in the drama side of things.''' ,'''I always found the dramatic side of things easier than the comedy, because there's so many ways to do comedy, and it's also subjective. Someone might not laugh at what you do, whereas if you're going to do a dramatic scene, there's usually only one way you can do it.''' ,'''People who win awards for drama and for crying their eyes out for two hours... it's easy!''' ,'''I honestly don't think you're taken seriously until you're 30. Any ideas I've ever taken to the BBC, they've told me I wasn't ready for it.''' ,'''Most people were annoyed with my voice, I think, because I'm working-class, and that doesn't sound quite right on Radio 4.''' ,'''I did a pilot for a show about community support officers, and all the community support officers were pleased that we didn't portray them as idiots.''' ,'''I'm used to writing and performing my own material; doing someone else's is refreshing.''' ,]
