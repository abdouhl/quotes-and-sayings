Ohio's should include it as well, and we support it.''' ,'''My job is to take the law as it's given to me and enforce it and implement it faithfully.''' ,'''Over the years, I think, more and more, I've come to recognize that my parents - not in a didactic or explicit way, but in a very powerful way by their example - gave me a sense that government could be a force for good.''' ,'''I know from my own experience that lawsuits can be a very slow, wasteful, and needlessly acrimonious way to resolve a problem.''' ,'''Reasonable regulations are essential to protect consumers from harmful practices and ensure that consumer financial markets operate in a fair, transparent, competitive manner.''' ,'''I'm not going to stand by and ignore things that I think are important to talk about.''' ,'''I think that if you're going after large banks and large financial companies to try to make sure people are being treated fairly, you're going to make some enemies, and you're going to make people uncomfortable.''' ,'''Debt collection is a market with real, persistent, and disturbing problems.''' ,'''We've very steadily and single-mindedly been building the bureau so that we can do the work that, quote, Congress required us to do and that the American people have every reason to expect, and deserve, that we will do.''' ,'''We pursued many actions against foreclosure rescue scammers who were reaching into the pockets of desperate people in an effort to steal what little remained as they sought to keep their homes.''' ,'''Our young people should not be put at risk and subject to unscientific and harmful actions such as 'conversion therapy.'''' ,'''What I feel is that we need an independent consumer watchdog.
