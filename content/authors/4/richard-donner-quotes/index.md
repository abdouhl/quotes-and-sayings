- I was tweaked by the idea of Superman immediately.
- I realized what you could do in motion pictures by surrounding yourself with geniuses.
- It's only been a couple of times in my life that I've really locked horns with actors. It did not hurt the films, it just hurt the moment of the filmmaking.

- I'm open to comments. I'm open to objective points of view, because I've been very narrow and very subjective.

- Soon it's all going to be digital anyway. It's all going to be saved on a little coin somewhere.

- That's how you get a performance - they put trust in you.
- I was an actor... or, at least, I was trying to be an actor.
- It was 1978 when Superman came out, and I kept thinking, Why don't they do something about it? They've done all these crappy attempts at comic book film adaptations. What can we do different? Why don't we just re-release this thing?
- If you had the opportunity and some talent, there was no way you couldn't progress, because it was an open market. There was the advertising world, and there was the documentary world.
- I was really disappointed that Warner Bros. didn't think highly enough of my film or my filmmaking to ask me to make the new Superman.
- I think what some people are doing with effects is starting to get silly. It's overused.
