quotes = ['''The Obama administration has been unable to call Jerusalem the capital of Israel because the Palestinians want to claim it as their capital in a future state.''' ,'''Between 1961 and 1982, 'The Catcher in the Rye' was the most censored book in high schools and libraries in the United States. But all the talk about banning it made me rush out to find it.''' ,'''In order to get re-elected, Obama told us Al Qaeda was on the run and all but defeated.''' ,'''While it has been mostly unreported, Mr. Trump has embraced the LGBT community like no other GOP nominee in history.''' ,'''I'm passionate about politics.''' ,'''I think what you are supposed to be when you are young is idealistic and passionate.''' ,'''The Obama Doctrine is to ignore an international crisis or go to war. There is no in between.''' ,'''California is a great place to live.''' ,'''While migration is inevitable, the fact remains that most people leave their homes to escape violence and the certain persecution that comes from it.''' ,'''The case against Susan Rice has been building for years with little fanfare. Not surprising, the mainstream media reporters based at the U.N. have either ignored her mistakes or strategically covered them up.''' ,'''President Obama believes getting along is more valuable than standing firm for U.S. interests.''' ,'''Since the fright of breast cancer hit our family, I have been surprised by how many people are dealing with breast cancer in their own family or with a loved one. One friend bluntly told me that she has been through it with her sister, her mom, and her grandmother, and all are healthy and mentally stronger because of the disease.''' ,'''For decades, the liberal media eviscerated the Religious Right and other conservatives for their own attacks against liberal social causes. Over time, the media labeled anyone who didn't agree with the Left's world view as intolerant.''' ,'''Most Republicans in California are tired of fighting the one-party rule from the Left and have given up on state politics.''' ,'''Journalists undoubtedly have a duty to push, cajole, and aggressively maneuver around campaign handlers in order for the public to see a candidate unscripted.''' ,'''While supporting human rights in another country is important, fighting for our own safety is crucial.''' ,'''I think President Obama is weak, bored with the office, and an incompetent leader.''' ,'''Overstating America's issues doesn't make us relatable; it makes others' issues easily dismissable.''' ,'''Parents, not governments, should decide what is best for their family.''' ,'''As president, Governor Romney would handle the Syrian conflict much differently. A President Romney would not ignore a growing conflict in a dangerous region involving allies the way Obama has, especially when chemical weapons could possibly be used.''' ,'''John Kerry is going to have a rough tenure as secretary of state. But let's face it: whoever came after Hillary Clinton was going to have to deal with a foreign affairs press corps that has been sleeping for four years. From the moment Hillary entered Foggy Bottom, political reporters have treated their beloved secretary of state with kid gloves.''' ,'''As political primaries approach, national media attention focuses on Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina.''' ,'''Federal employees are public servants, not partisan foot soldiers for President Obama, and shouldn't have to decide whether a partisan White House request can be ignored without consequences.''' ,'''Without American leadership at the U.N., countries just continue to talk and socialize and spend taxpayer dollars.''' ,'''When it comes to Iran, we must not accept Obama's inconsistencies and weakness.''' ,'''Foreign aid should not be automatic. Countries should have to make their case every year, and American officials should openly decide what, if anything, to fund.''' ,'''If you don't want war, then you had better be an advocate for diplomacy with muscle.''' ,'''I spent eight years at the U.N., so I understand that U.S. ambassadors have a lot of issues to cover.''' ,'''Presidents and cabinet officials could send a strong message of accountability if they held senior appointees responsible for their performance.''' ,''''The Catcher in the Rye' was targeted by some schools as a book too risque to read and certainly not appropriate for young minds. My parents certainly would not have approved of the book, but I secretly read it when I was in 7th grade. I felt so rebellious, and my young mind loved it.''' ,'''Diplomacy and coalition-building are hard work and not easy for any president.''' ,'''When foreigners struggle for their freedoms, they've long expected the U.S. government to be the first to stand with them.''' ,'''China understands economics more than most countries and is usually moved to increase freedoms when the yuan is directly involved.''' ,'''Too many members of the U.N. benefit from the status quo and won't make decisions for purely altruistic reasons.''' ,'''Obama has created a new world where countries ignore the U.S. without consequence. It's so bad that Saudi Arabia doesn't even want to serve on the Security Council with the U.S. because it might ruin their reputation.''' ,'''Hillary Clinton's Russian re-set policy gave Moscow permission to go from privately challenging U.S. foreign policy to publicly moving military hardware into Syria to prop up Bashar al-Assad and annexing Crimea from Ukraine. And Donald Trump seems to support the idea that Putin will be Putin. It's enough to leave America's allies confused.''' ,'''Maybe Hillary Clinton was right in 2008 when she called Barack Obama 'naive' on foreign policy.''' ,'''There is no way to expect one ambassador to cover all of the U.S. government's priority issues, and certainly there are a plethora of U.N. meetings that drag on with an unlimited number of speakers and no time limits.''' ,'''Speaking out and challenging the status quo is seldom cheered at the UN.''' ,'''While some entertainment executives understand the power of having someone else speak for you, most Hollywood publicists don't.''' ,'''Attorneys general, district attorneys, and federal prosecutors have a responsibility to separate their politics from their law enforcement powers.''' ,'''The deplorable Syrian refugee crisis was created because Syrian President Bashar al-Assad started a war on his people, and the international community refused to confront him.''' ,'''U.S. foreign aid must be used more strategically to achieve our national security goals.''' ,'''Cancer taught my family that my mom is much stronger than we ever thought. Faced with a devastating diagnosis, she just kept going and living - never complaining.''' ,'''Many people vote a straight party line from the president down to city council. Hollywood publicists need to think long and hard about who they are putting forward to lead their awards season campaigns.''' ,'''The Washington media crowd, including conservative media, preaches to the choir of news junkies.''' ,'''Biden's support for Mubarak in the face of his falling regime sends a powerful and unfortunate message to the Arab world that their freedoms are negotiable.''' ,'''The next time a news outlet complains about the state of our political rhetoric or the uninformed U.S. voter, we should promptly point them to the video of Ashley Parker raucous in a Polish cemetery or Philip Rucker's diatribes on party invitations.''' ,'''While other countries may espouse the liberal utopian dream of a global community, it's usually only to get the richer countries to pay more money for the world's problems.''' ,'''What is needed to pass gay marriage is not a Democratic majority - this past year has proven that to be true - but politicians and judges comfortable enough to ignore what the majority of the voters want and do what is uncomfortable, unpopular - and morally right.''' ,'''The Left sees no place for differing opinions.''' ,'''The Obama doctrine of ignoring international issues and claiming it's none of the U.S.' business is a philosophy that has allowed Russia, Iran, and China to step up and take the lead.''' ,'''The mainstream media decided long ago that Hillary Clinton was going to be a fabulous global leader regardless of how she performed.''' ,'''Every once in a while, brave companies step out and act in ways that move customers and shareholders to also act in good faith.''' ,'''We may never really know if 2004 Democratic presidential nominee and Senator John Kerry was President Obama's original choice to be Secretary of State or if he settled on Kerry after his first pick, Susan Rice, was forced out by her troublesome career and misleading statements on the Benghazi terrorist attack.''' ,'''The money from wealthy nations to confront some very real global poverty and economic issues is largely given out of guilt.''' ,'''Many developing nations have such severe debt and budget problems that the money given by developed nations will never be spent the way it is intended.''' ,'''Voters should absolutely know that a future president has the instincts to react to real-life and unrehearsed situations.''' ,'''It is hard to know exactly when the Arab Spring, a phrase used to describe the beginning of the Arab peoples' demand for democracy and human-rights reform, started.''' ,'''Tough decisions are never popular to make and even less popular to force upon the U.N.''' ,'''While the Obama White House is completely incompetent and weak, they know how to spin everyday Americans.''' ,'''One of the reasons the American public holds unelected government officials in such low esteem is that they are never held accountable for their failures.''' ,'''Millions of people walk into the voting booth and vote for someone they like.''' ,'''Equal rights should not be debatable and certainly should not be put to a vote of the people.

They both have a detailed and complexed view of how some on Wall Street manipulate the game. They know where the excesses are and who is to blame. If willing to take on their friends, they both could reform Wall Street from the inside.''' ,'''The Obama Doctrine is the first presidential strategy in history that is exclusively about communicating - not implementing - policy. The Obama Doctrine seems to be 'tweet with overwhelming force.'''' ,'''Wall Street, like every industry, has good and bad players.''' ,'''It's true that John Bolton would not win the most popular ambassador award at the U.N., but being popular shouldn't be the priority.''' ,'''Guilt by association is part of campaigning.''' ,'''The Russian propaganda machine, even in the U.S., is not to be discounted.''' ,'''When Barack Obama was running for president, he committed to leading the United Nations and other countries towards a common global goal. Obama believed that he could speak to allies and dictators directly and charm them into seeing the error of their ways.''' ,'''Very few teachers or leaders in my small Michigan community ever discussed the issue of 'The Catcher in the Rye,' and certainly no one came to the 1951 Novel's defense.''' ,'''Foreign aid, though less than 1% of the annual federal budget, is often a hard case to make to constituents who are rightfully worried about domestic and economic issues.''' ,'''Hesitating and hand-wringing when confronted by violence discourages the human-rights activists on the front lines and emboldens the enemy.''' ,'''U.S. academics and Upper East Side New Yorkers like to think of the United Nations as a place where foreign ambassadors have intellectual discussions about power and world peace.''' ,'''While we all want the U.N. to live up to its original intent and be the place where the world comes together to solve international problems, the reality is the U.N. isn't all that different from any other political body. Countries and individuals play to the cameras, create good theatre, and negotiate selfishly.''' ,'''In the past, liberals have competed to see who could shout the loudest to shut down the banks, ridicule success, and penalize anyone working in finance. In fact, the Occupy Wall Street movement was an aggressive liberal effort to shut down Wall Street banks.''' ,'''From the moments Obama took office, he has downplayed the threats from radical Islamists.''' ,'''Nominating Susan Rice for Secretary of State is a mistake not just because of her Sunday show deceptions but because her tenure as America's representative to the U.N. has been unworthy of a promotion.''' ,'''Consistent conservatives should frame their views in accordance with the fundamental belief that individuals, not governments, have the right to determine the course of their own lives.''' ,'''Despite the debt, the traffic, the one-party rule, the taxes, and the eagerness of politicians to overwhelm small businesses and large corporate job producers with red tape and unnecessary regulations, the Golden State is still the most beautiful place to live and work in the United States.''' ,'''While religious institutions should be able to pick and choose which unions they bless, civil governments should issue marriage licenses to all couples.''' ,'''The big-ego temper tantrums of Wall Street's titans must be a concern for everyone on Wall Street. Bad behavior and manipulation of the markets must be called out by those in the industry concerned for its future.''' ,'''Boko Haram has pledged its allegiance and support to ISIS. The Northern Nigerian-based Islamic terrorist group wants Sharia law throughout Nigeria and beyond.''' ,'''No one really disagrees that all of humanity has a responsibility to protect fellow citizens in a time of need.''' ,'''California Democrats are out to kill the American dream by ridiculing the commitment to hard work.''' ,'''Most people in Washington assumed if Obama made it to the White House he would appoint Biden as his secretary of state, a position Biden openly admitted he wanted.''' ,'''Activists create nonprofits for the sole purpose of suing their enemies, collecting a settlement check, and paying lawyers to find the next frivolous lawsuit.''' ,'''One sure way to ruin American credibility in the Arab world is to sit silently in Damascus and look like you're part of the Assad show.''' ,'''While American interests in the Middle East must obviously be protected, America's credibility to support democracy for everyone everywhere is crucial.''' ,'''Fellow conservatives, particularly within the Republican Party, typically do a good job arguing against totalitarian, one-size-fits-all approaches to policy.
