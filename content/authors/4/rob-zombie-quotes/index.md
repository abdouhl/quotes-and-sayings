- I like 1977 because it is more primitive. If it were modern day, like one Universal guy was like wouldn't they just use their cell phone? I guess he did not read that it was 1977 in the script.
- Great things come out of being hungry and cold. Once you're pampered, you get lazy.
- When you lock a movie's release date and then move it two months, it's just not good. It's good for everything but the cast, crew, and people who are creatively trying to make a film.
- I am like the Jack Nicholson of the Kings - every single game. If there was a game tonight I wouldn't be here. I used to play hockey. That was my original thing. My first thing, I wanted to play professional hockey.
- I like being organized and super particular.
- Those days if you drove cross country and you broke down on the side of the road, and the sign says 200 miles to the next gas station, you knew you were so screwed.
- Without really analyzing it, I grew up in Massachusetts, so the Salem witch trials were always something that I was around. The average kindergartner probably doesn't know about it, except that in Massachusetts, you do, because they'll take you on field trips to see reenactments and stuff.
- Every time I start the next movie, it's as exciting as the first time.
- I like movies where you can come back and re-watch them and admire the cinematography 25 years later.
- I'm not a big fan of the thought that you can become a star by winning a contest. I'm sort of old-fashioned. I think people need to get out there and they need to work and they need to do their music because they love it. If they become successful, then great, and if they are not, whatever.
- I wanted it to be like a high quality, drive-in movie.
- I think so much about everything. I'm obsessive.
- I'm never aiming to make a movie like someone else's movie, but in order to describe a movie to someone else who hasn't seen it, you usually have to reference things they have seen.
- Once you feel like you're being dictated by other people's expectations, it usually backfires.
- But I think bands that rolled in with a big attitude, like they were some big deal, I just found that very strange.
- Just getting movies made is difficult because it takes a lot of money; I mean, it costs more money to make one movie than most bands will spend on every single record of their entire career; it's a huge undertaking.
- To me, horror and comedy never work. Never worked for me, anyway.
- White Zombie was a bunch of kids with the worst equipment playing in a basement. But that is what is so great about it. There is no reason to think that you can't do it.
- I understand why some kid in his bedroom in Wisconsin thinks downloading songs couldn't hurt anyone. True fans will buy the CD or go see the movie after downloading, but to say it doesn't affect anyone - come on.
- NC-17 means that you get it in like 3 theaters. They won't run the spots on MTV, won't run the advertising. It's the kiss of death so there was really no other choice.
- I never made movies that had any of my music. I haven't crossed them over that much.
- The funny thing is, I'm so used to not caring what anyone says, good or bad, that unfortunately even when people say good things... I wish it made me feel good, but it doesn't.
- Josh Brolin is an actor that I really, really like; he's fantastic. I worked with him once; he's a really great actor.
- You know... the only person I really had to please after a point was the MPAA. Because Lions' Gate was like, hey, whatever you can get away with is fine, we don't care.
- I don't know that I have a fascination with witches per se - well, maybe I just have a fascination with everything that's weird.
- I remember, especially like when I was in high school, going to see like Dawn of the Dead and it was like mayhem in the theater and you could barely even watch the movie. It was so fun.
- You might like it as a joke or because you liked it then, but there isn't a whole new generation discovering Wham!.
- As far as directors, I'm a big fan of any kind of Billy Wilder stuff. Anything he does.
- I think probably the scariest thing, as weird as it sounds, was 'The Wizard of Oz' and the flying monkeys with the witch. I remember seeing that - it still seems freaky.
- I love Westerns. I really love John Wayne. Frank Capra, any of his movies I love.
- I'd always want to decorate my bedroom. I needed visuals and to be stimulated by things. I'm still like that. It's the way I see the world.
- I really just do what I like. I don't understand what the general public likes sometimes.
- The pirating thing is bad. The people it hurts the most are the ones you least think it hurts. It's not the big Britney Spears albums that are being pirated; it's the indie bands that don't have two cents to their name.
- I don't want to just make horror movies; I don't want to just make any type of movie - I don't just like horror movies, I love movies.
- My advice: Don't quit. When I got to New York City, I lived so far below the poverty line, because I didn't give in and get a job at 7-Eleven. I think you can thrive in misery.
- When I watch a movie, I don't make a sound or move. The more I'm into the movie, the more bored I look.
- The hardest part was convincing people that I was serious. The people were like 'you want to do this again'?
- It was like fighting with the MPAA... to me it was like this is an R easy... but it was NC 17 over and over and even with this cut they were like, you are right on the edge buddy, one more thing and it's NC-17.
- My goal is to keep making films and grow as a film maker; that's always my goal.
- By the time we got to MGM, and Lions Gate the movie was done there was nothing else to say. It was done. Just as at Universal, it was art by committee.
- Probably the biggest thing that surprises people is that I am obsessed with hockey. I grew up in the Boston area so I am obsessed with hockey since I was a little kid.
- I don't believe in fate, because I'm not spiritual, but things do seem to work out.
- I love all kinds of movies. I'd especially like to make some, you know, violent crime drama.
- It's never been about making money.
- There are so many projects that don't happen, just sometimes they don't get announced, so no one ever knows about them and you don't have to talk about them.
- All the classic bands that have been around forever, they came up gradually.
- I think it is good escapist entertainment even though it's bad.
- Things like that become a blur - shot at some soundstage, somewhere - that's as much as I can remember.
- When you have too many people and you're trying to satisfy everybody's input, you usually end up with something so incredibly generic that it has no point of view.
- Some people hate the remixes, some people think it's cool. If you don't like that type of music and just like rock, you probably won't like it. But if you are open to more things, you just might dig it.
- Growing up, I had the weird fantasy list: I wanted to be Alice Cooper, Steven Spielberg, and Stan Lee. You have to have almost psychotic drive, because you're going to have years of failure.
