- I had my bully, and it was excruciating. Not only the bully, but the intimidation I felt.
- I can't remember a time when I wasn't trying to get something down on paper.
- Family life was wonderful. The streets were bleak. The playgrounds were bleak. But home was always warm. My mother and father had a great relationship. I always felt 'safe' there.
- I have always had a sense that we are all pretty much alone in life, particularly in adolescence.
- I take real people and put them in extraordinary situations.
- You seldom get a censorship attempt from a 14-year-old boy. It's the adults who get upset.
- I simply write with an intelligent reader in mind. I don't think about how old they are.
- My dream was to be known as a writer and to be able to produce at least one book that would be read by people. That dream came true with the publication of my first novel - and all the rest has been a sweet bonus.
- The beautiful part of writing is that you don't have to get it right the first time, unlike, say, a brain surgeon. You can always do it better, find the exact word, the apt phrase, the leaping simile.
- All the stories I'll ever need are right here on Main Street.
- I've had aunts and uncles who not only haven't read my books but could hardly believe that I was a writer.
