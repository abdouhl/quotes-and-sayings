- I think there were some dubious feelings about it, that the first 'Scarface' would not be surpassed by the second 'Scarface.' We were wrong; it surpassed it. The acting talent, the cinematography - we were propelled into a real class action film. Long after I kick the bucket, it'll be played.
- I don't know why it was canceled, but 'Mancuso, FBI,' it should have had a good long run, but it wasn't picked up. Maybe there was a problem with me. I have no idea.
- John Huston is more of a creative director than most.
- We rehearsed our 'Scarface' to the nines. Long period of rehearsal, so that by the time we started to shoot, it was almost like doing a play. We all had a grand time doing it. It was a wonderful cast.
- Working with David Lynch was like taking a bullet. A gun at you. 'Lost Highway' is, I think, one of the best films I've ever been in. It'll endure a long, long time.
- I can't be under the weight of the character for a 14-hour shooting day. I don't think anybody can do that.
- Nevertheless, I tend to get offensive easily.
- An actor is an impersonator; he plays many different roles. If you played the same role all the time, God - that'd be a boring career. When you take on different roles and become a different person, that's called acting... It's a challenge.
