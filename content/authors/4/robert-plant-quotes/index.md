quotes = ['''The past is a stepping stone, not a millstone.''' ,'''I realized what Led Zeppelin was about around the end of our first U.S. tour. We started off not even on the bill in Denver, and by the time we got to New York we were second to Iron Butterfly, and they didn't want to go on!''' ,'''I really had to think and learn about musical intervals.''' ,'''I'm not a flowerchild or anything like that... whatever it was.''' ,'''I'm a grandfather now.''' ,'''We are trying to communicate a fulfilled ideal. Does anybody remember laughter?''' ,'''I think I could sing and shear a few sheep at the same time.''' ,'''You would find in a lot of Zep stuff that the riff was the juggernaut that careered through and I worked the lyrics around this.''' ,'''Entertainment isn't just based on the very structured syndrome of European popular music, and it's great that there are so many thousands of people who are of the same opinion.''' ,'''Alone I'm nothing.''' ,'''I'm so aware of the fact that if I hadn't taken the chances that I've taken along the line, I probably wouldn't be getting the best out of my voice anymore, I might have messed it up in that awful, predictable place.''' ,'''I don't know how much more expressive you can get than being a rock and roll singer.''' ,'''Lately, I'm spending more and more time working with non-rock musicians and leaving the mainstream - almost dissolving into another world, musically.''' ,'''Whenever I have bid a hasty goodbye to a loved one, I've always made sure that my record collection was safely stored away in the boot of the car.''' ,'''People say that I'm a millionaire, but that's not true - I only spend millions.''' ,'''My vocal style I haven't tried to copy from anyone. It just developed until it became the girlish whine it is today.''' ,'''I'm just lucky because my kids are grown-up - I love them, very proud of them, and we are in close contact as big-time friends, but they don't need me that much now and I can actually enjoy this wonderful world of music.''' ,'''There's nothing worse than a bunch of jaded old farts, and that's a fact.''' ,'''I wanted my voice to be a tenor sax, really.''' ,'''When I was a kid, I was following black soul music.''' ,'''I think we're in a disposable world and 'Stairway to Heaven' is one of the things that hasn't quite been thrown away yet.''' ,'''I don't think I've aged gracefully.''' ,'''I've stopped apologizing to myself for having this great period of success and financial acceptance.''' ,'''I hate cliche.''' ,'''You know, people can't fall in love with me just because I'm good at what I do.''' ,'''I don't want to scream 'Immigrant Song' every night for the rest of my life, and I'm not sure I could.''' ,'''Old men do it better. We're not so sensitive in certain areas.''' ,'''When you're 20 years old and you're making points with volume and dynamism, it's a fantastic thing to do.''' ,'''All over the world, the idea of creating an melange of international musics, it's a very healthy thing.''' ,'''You feel quite distant by playing at huge stadiums year after year, where you only can see a great darkness in front of you.''' ,'''The events between 1968 and 1980 were the kind of cornerstone for everything I've been able to do, they gave me the springboard.''' ,'''The trouble is now, with rock'n'roll and stuff, it gets so big that it loses what once upon a time was a magnificent thing, where it was special and quite elusive and occasionally a little sinister and it had its own world nobody could get in.''' ,'''A daily blog would just about finish me off completely.''' ,'''There's a similarity between European and North African folk musics.''' ,'''I've still got a twinkle in me.''' ,'''I've got the big name, but I've always wanted to be in a band, one of a band.''' ,'''I hate wasting time.''' ,'''No, I've never thought that I was gay.

The essence of my lyrics is the desire for peace and harmony. That's all anyone has ever wanted. How could it become outdated?''' ,'''Since I was a kid, I've had an absolute obsession with particular kinds of American music. Mississippi Delta blues of the Thirties, Chicago blues of the Fifties, West Coast music of the mid-Sixties - but I'd never really touched on dark Americana.''' ,'''It's sort of a feeling of power onstage. It's really the ability to make people smile, or just to turn them one way or another for that duration of time, and for it to have some effect later on.

And there's a generation of kids now who won't know it, post-Linkin Park.''' ,'''So for a long time I closed my eyes to the possibility of America having a white voice.''' ,'''I think I surprise myself.''' ,'''Now I'm a blithering oaf hanging on to the coatsleeves of commerciality.''' ,'''There's no point stepping up to the golden platform if you're going to repeat yourself.''' ,'''I have to try and change the landscape, whatever it is.''' ,'''My dad played fiddle as well.''' ,'''I can't moan about any of it.
