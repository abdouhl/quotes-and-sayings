- It's a very funny topic, missing weight and getting title shots. I think the punishments should be more severe, but I don't know.
- I never expected to do what I can, but with my coaching staff and my training and coming to terms with my own ability and my own talent and realizing the potential that there is, I've decided that I want to make a run for it. I'm training, and I'm fighting for a title.
- I will be in the UFC one day, and it will take more than one man to stop me.
- I don't try to be someone I'm not.
- I'm always trying to prove myself to the rest of the world.
- I don't think you ever get used to being away from home.
- Michael Bisping's whole life is a film scene. He's always acting. Confronting me at UFC 213, it makes me laugh. It's a bit clownish.
- Everyone thinks Australia and New Zealand MMA fighters don't have that wrestling base, whereas a lot of Americans and other countries have, with them being able to do wrestling at high-school levels.
- I started training with Fabricio Itte with my wrestling and high performance; I started spending a lot more time with my head coach Henry Perez and also my grappling coach Alex Prates. Those three are my core team, and they've made hugely important changes and skill enhancements with my game.
- Although I didn't spend much time in New Zealand at all, I feel really privileged to have that Maori blood and link to my past. I got my tattoo out of respect to that.
- It's definitely been a progression, but I always knew I could be a great fighter. I could feel it inside of myself.
- I watch a couple of fights to get a visual image in my head. I don't like doing a lot of research on my opponents; I leave that to my coaches.
- If you don't make weight, you're breaching a contract, straight up.
- I hit hard, and I hit fast - much faster than Bisping, much harder than Bisping, and I have much better defence than Bisping.
- I used to get so stressed out before the fight, weeks out, because of how much weight I had to cut to get there.
- I don't think of myself as the champion too often, honestly.
- I think the mental preparation isn't something that you can work on in one large sum. It has to be a collective collaboration of doing little things for your mental state constantly throughout the prep and managing your life outside the Octagon, managing your life in transit to the Octagon, managing your life once you get to training.
- I want to be known as one of the best fighters ever. I don't just need a shiny medallion to tell me anything. I want to beat all the top-caliber dudes.
- Come fight night, there will be nerves, but it's how you react to those nerves - doing what you need to regardless - that's how you win fights.
- My mother's Maori, and my father's Australian. I take my strength from both my ancestors, and I'm really privileged.
- I train hard; I have the best coaching staff in the world... We always do the right things. I stick to the plan, and we get things done.
- Moving to middleweight had a massive impact on my training regime and my mental space leading into everyday training. I was training for the fight, not just trying to burn calories and get my weight down. It was a big mental relief there.
- With a guy like Yoel Romero, if he senses weakness, he will capitalize on it every time he can.
- I think everyone has to have their mettle tested in a tough fight.
- It is amazing to have the UFC to come here to Perth... it is great for Australian Mixed Martial Arts and great for the sport, and it is going to be great for Perth to have such a world-wide event, through pay-per-view, hosted here.
- The journey has moulded me into the person I am today. The journey of my mixed martial arts experience has been filled with ups and downs, but through that, I have come out a much better man.
- With the UFC, anything can happen, really.
- I vigorously train in my jui jitsu and my wrestling, but my stand-up game gives me a huge advantage in defending take-downs.
- Basically, I try to get across my striking, wrestling and grappling, and jujitsu. Every day, across the board, I try to get an equal amount of sessions throughout the week because I need to improve in all aspects of my fighting.
- It was an absolute honour to fight in Vegas. Every fighter dreams of fighting at the MGM Grand. That's where so many legends have fought before and so many legends will continue to fight.
- I've always known I've had power.
- It's an absolute honour and privilege to get out there and be an Australian headlining an Australian card. That's unreal; it really is.
- When I made the UFC, everyone said, 'You need to go overseas.' I thought I had to go as well, and I went to Tristar Gym, and I was there for one or two years. But changes were needed. I'd come off back-to-back losses - Court McGee and Stephen Thompson - and I needed to look at my roots and go back to the drawing board.
- The reason I fight is to provide for my family, and I cannot risk having that taken away.
- My philosophy is fight anyone, anywhere. If you're going to be the best then you're going to have to beat them all, so why pick and choose?
- The UFC are my employers, so they have to come first.
- It's coffee - if I have just the right amount, I come across as charismatic. One too many, and it's like I'm having a seizure.
- Happiness is a key to my success, and my family is a root of that.
- Getting back to 100 per cent is one thing, but working at 100 per cent is something else entirely. And given one of my main goals has always been improving my skill set, to do that, I need to be working out at 100 per cent.
- The UFC does what it wants. That's just how it is.
- Every fight, I try to get out there and set an example to show the rest of the world we have fighters from Australia, and we're for real, and we're here to stay.
- I'm very proud of my heritage and the blood that runs through my veins. I take a lot of strength from that.
- I like to think I learn a lot out of every fight.
- It's definitely a reason I game so much: to forget about the pressures of fighting and the hardships of training and everything.
- My standard training week, there's a lot of training in there. I have a high-performance coach who manages these spreadsheets of mine, manages my sessions and my loads. It's a very complicated process, and he puts me through about 22 sessions a week.
- I don't pick and choose. I've never really had an qualms about who I fight next.
- As a fan of this sport, I am gutted to see 'Jacare' lose. To be matched up against him and to have the honor of fighting him, it blew my mind.
- All my skill sets have grown; my experience in the Octagon has grown. I honestly just think I'm getting better with every fight.
- Do I want everyone in Australia to know who I am? Absolutely. But the only way I can do that is by winning fights.
- That's the game plan - I've got it written down on paper: beat everyone. And that's what I'm looking forward to doing.
- Having a little boy gave me a foundation and centred my life a bit more.
- People smarter than me told me that my potential was bigger than just winning a belt. Now I believe that, and that's what I'm striving for.
- I have faith in my wrestling, faith in my grappling, and faith in my striking.
- When you get chickenpox as an adult, it's not a laughing matter.
- Before The Ultimate Fighter, I was appearing before a couple of hundred people at most. Now, I'm on the card of a Las Vegas blockbuster... this is every Australian fighter's dream.
- Everyone needs an objective, and everyone needs a goal, and it was frustrating just kind of being at a standstill.
- I've never cared who I fight. And that's something I just say - 'I'll fight anyone' - it's something I've lived up to my whole career. And I'm proud of that.
- I don't have any ill will towards any of my opponents. I understand we are the highest calibre of athlete in this sport, and we will both go and give it our all. But I don't want anyone to misinterpret what I am saying: when we step into that octagon and we touch gloves, I am going to break his face.
- If Mayweather wants to come over and fight in the UFC, then do it. It's hardcore here, though. I don't think it'll be a stroll in the park. Granted, he's the best boxer ever seen, just about.
- I'm a distance fighter - if you've seen me fight, I like ducking in and out.
- No fighter wants to risk getting ring rust.
- Take a martial art that you enjoy. Don't worry about the end result; just enjoy getting up and going to training. And there is no right martial art to do. They are all good.
- Fighting on home soil is always a dream come true, and I'd love to unify the title here in Australia.
- I see all my hard fights as title fights. Every time I go in there, I'm fighting for my life.
- I just don't want to be a champion; I want to be one of the best fighters there ever was.
- Every time I step out there in the Octagon, I aim to do Australia proud. And this isn't for popularity or a fan base; it has never been for that. It's just because I love my country, and I want to show the world what we're doing down here.
- Pretty much all my mother's side is Kiwi, and we have a strong Maori heritage.
- Obviously, that's the thing any athlete wants to be able to do, to take weaknesses and turn them into strengths.
- I was born in New Zealand, and I was raised in Australia, and I'm very proud of that.
- Court McGee is definitely a name worth fighting - and beating.
- I'm happy to fight anyone. There's no particular person I want to fight next.
- Fighting is fighting. Family life is family life. I need a distinct barrier between the two. Obviously, my family dictate how I'm feeling and my head space. But work's work.
- Everyone knows I like to fight injured. Half the fights I've taken, I've always been injured.
- I would love to have a crack at Michael Bisping - with or without the gold, I'd want to have a crack at him because I respect him as a fighter, and he's a tough dude, and I'd love to swing it out with him.
- I'm a very objective-driven bloke, so to have a goal in mind and to have something to do is very important to me.
- Put me in with anyone in the top 10, and I win.
- I need to take fights, and I expect to win all my fights, whether it's higher ranked or lower ranked.
- Michael Bisping versus Georges St-Pierre is a money fight, and the UFC loves money fights.
- I'm very objective driven, so for me it's very important to know who I'm fighting, when I'm fighting, and roughly the direction I'm working in. It gives me that little extra push to do what I need to do to get the sessions, to work towards something.
- I think it's highly unprofessional to not make weight.
- I've got to give props to my dad. He got me into the UFC and the MMA scene to begin with.
- Family are my greatest source of strength. Emotion - they help me deal with that. One look at them, and I know everything is OK.
- Sometimes, it doesn't matter if you're the world champ or not.
- When you ask a guy, 'Are you gonna take a fight if your opponent doesn't make weight?' Is it really asking? Does he really have a choice? When you back them into a corner like that, is there really a choice to be made?
- I know that it's a fight at the end of the day; it's not a grappling match.
- Who am I to tell people what to do with their own careers and how they're doing?
- I've been dropped on my head multiple times.
- Obviously wrestling is a core component of MMA. And among UFC fighters, my take-down defence is considered quite high.
- I actually think that wrestling is much harder than MMA, to be honest.
- I want to fight all the best. I want to be the best fighter in the world. The only way to truly attain that title is by beating everyone.
- Fighter, father, husband - it's all the same person. I know the UFC stereotype is that we're all thugs. But I'd like people to know that I don't have to switch one off to try to be another. Being a father and a fighter, it's who I am.
- I'm definitely driven to go as far as I can.
- I like eating. I like food.
- I'm very picky with what I read. It's a specific genre of science fiction.
- Everyone knows what crappy food is: high grease, high fat... or what clean eating is. They just make excuses not to do it.
- I wouldn't be in this sport if I didn't think I could make it to the top.
- I'm hugely into video games; I always have been. I started on the Sega with games like Sonic, Battletoads, and Tetris... all those old-school games.
- I'm a striker. That's what I enjoy doing. And any chance to display that, I'm happy.
- You know those hard days you go home where you've been worked to the bone and you just want to do nothing? In fight prep, every day is that day.
- I have great striking, really great striking, and I hit very hard.
