- Duncan Sheik and I are trucking along on 'American Psycho,' which is sort of the anti-Superman, you know? But it's a lot of fun, too, in a much, much darker way, obviously.
- I'm finding that I'm working with more and more Latino artists, and that's exciting.
- Zombies are eternal. They're like dinosaurs.
- Comics are in my blood. It's my strange addiction, and I love it.
- One of my comics is read by more people - around 70,000 - than will see my entire run at Manhattan Theater Club. That puts things in perspective.
- I love the idea of writing these huge, bombastic characters; I'll stay in the superhero world as long as I can.
- Musicals and horror movies are my two favorite genres because they're about extremes.
- I grew up reading comic books. Super hero comic books, Archie comic books, horror comic books, you name it.
- One of my favorite graphic novels of all time is Grant Morrison's 'Earth-2.'
- When you tell people you're a playwright, their eyes sort of glaze over. But when you say you write the 'Fantastic Four' or 'Spider-Man,' they perk up. It's a touchstone that has gained more credibility as artistic expression.
- One of the best things that happened for me as a playwright is becoming a comic-book writer.
- I am drawn to Americana, and I am drawn to gothic stories, and I love American gothic stories.
- I've never read 'Pride and Prejudice and Zombies,' although I certainly know what that is. And what I love about that concept is as much as it's a zombie story, it's also 'Pride and Prejudice.'
- I'm a huge Stephen King fan.
