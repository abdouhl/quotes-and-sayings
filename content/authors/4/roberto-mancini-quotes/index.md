- When you go to another country, you can work with different players in different situations, in a different culture.
- In Italy, some managers want distance from the players, the Fabio Capello style, but that is not my way. I am more like Carlo Ancelotti. There are aspects of the players' behaviour I do not understand, but I want them to respect our situation. If they do that, I have a lot of respect for them, too, and I will do everything to help them.

- Manchester is the same as Milan. The weather is the same, and you have two big clubs fighting against each other.
- People talk about the speed of the English game, but in Italy, referees blow their whistles very often, so you cannot build up speed. In England, referees wave play on, and so it becomes faster.
- Neymar is a good player.
- In the national team, the armband always goes to the player with the most caps.
- I always try to work hard and well if it's possible.
- You are there to score goals, and doing so shows respect for your opponent, it demonstrates that you are taking him seriously.
- You need two or three players who can do that - play behind the striker, on the right wing, the left wing... striker, maybe. If we have those, it's good for the team.
- I'm very happy about what I did in Manchester. I love the Manchester City supporters, and I had a fantastic experience.
- Every manager can improve.
- I'm sorry to see Balotelli waste his talent the way he does, but I think he can keep people entertained by scoring goals.
- Sometimes you get players who think it is not important to work, and this is their worst mistake.
