Whatever comes, comes.''' ,'''I'm just trying to make up for lost times, and I have total awareness that when the work is coming it doesn't mean it's going to continue to come, so I'm taking advantage of this phenomenal period that I'm in now, to its fullest.''' ,'''Let me put it this way: I definitely need to understand the villains I play. The best cause pain to anesthetize themselves against their own pain.''' ,'''I think now that I'm in the autumn of my life, and I'm getting a chance of having an overview and looking at the shape of how things happen, when things happen, why things happen, I think it was fitting that I spent most of my early career doing mask work, because I just don't think I was that comfortable in my own skin.''' ,'''Somebody who doesn't care if they live or die is the most dangerous human being on earth.''' ,'''I love great animation.''' ,'''I say yes to almost anything that comes my way.''' ,'''So much of my aesthetic was formed by my dad.''' ,'''Well, I don't have an agenda.''' ,'''You know, I don't read the blogs, or go on the internet, and I really just don't know what people are saying because... well I guess I'm afraid to.''' ,'''I never direct myself, because I don't like working with me. I would punch me in the mouth if I had to take my direction.''' ,'''I actually think it's harder to play vulnerability, because you're having to delve deeper into portions of your own psyche, what it is that makes you human.''' ,'''Almost all of your life is lived by the seat of your pants, one unexpected event crashing into another, with no pattern or reason, and then you finally reach a point, around my age, where you spend more time than ever looking back. Why did this happen? Look where that led? You see the shape of things.''' ,'''Distortions control my self-image, like they do for a lot of us. It's irrational.''' ,'''I don't think that I've had a career like anyone else's, but there are hosts and hosts of actors whose careers I admire.''' ,'''If something strikes me as insane and unjust, I cannot tolerate that.''' ,'''I do voicework all the time.''' ,'''Every job has a unique situational circumstance.''' ,'''I'm kind of one of these guys who wants to play everything once before it's all over.''' ,'''I think there are a lot of technocrats in the business who would much rather work with just wheels and gears and machinery.

In fact, I got thrown off the swimming team and was forced to audition for the school play because they had at the audition about 35 girls show up and no boys, so my swimming coach suggested that I might be able to do the drama department more good than I was doing the swimming team.''' ,'''In the early '90s, when those little art films started coming out, we were introduced to Quentin Tarantino and guys like that, and independent cinema was something that everyone wanted to be a part of.''' ,]
