We're better than that. It's frankly offensive and archaic and it makes me so angry I want to punch a wall.''' ,'''Victoria Wood's 'Dinnerladies' is just exceptionally written; every single line is a setup or a punchline.''' ,'''I told my mum recently, when I used to envisage my adulthood, it was just me working at a corner shop that mum and dad could drive me to and pick me up from. I couldn't ever imagine living on my own and having a job that I wanted to do. Because I never saw it.''' ,'''I feel like the luckiest person in comedy.''' ,'''I think as creatures we're incredibly sociable, and I do think comedy brings us all together.''' ,'''How could anyone like me for my true self? Being gay, disabled, loud and funny was too much in one 5ft person.''' ,'''I pride myself on being excellent at fancy dress, and I have dressed up as Ronald McDonald, Lady Gaga, a Christmas pudding and a crocodile to name but a few.''' ,'''I think that the way forward now is more schemes and much more disabled people on TV: in sitcoms, in soaps. A disabled person reading the news would be the dream.''' ,'''I had an education at a mainstream school, I went to university, I got a job and with my cerebral palsy have been a successful and independent human being and I am proud of who I am.''' ,'''I really think there's a difference between people born disabled and people who become disabled.''' ,'''Growing up, I'd heard so much about Barbados.

I was starved of oxygen and didn't breathe for fifteen minutes, which I really wouldn't recommend.''' ,'''I just knew I had it, but my mum and dad were always great, and it was always a thing I had but a thing that wasn't bad. It was just saying like, I have brown hair, I have brown eyes, and I've got cerebral palsy.''' ,'''Like, if you don't want to talk to me it's your loss, and basically I'm a big deal so you should be bloody lucky to be talking to me.''' ,'''It's easy to think, 'Oh I could be able-bodied,' but throughout my life I always thought, 'Yeah but I could also be even more disabled.'''' ,'''There was nobody I could follow and look up to so I decided to be that person, to be the leader. If we were in the media more, it would make disabled people's lives much easier.''' ,'''I never came across a character who was brilliant, funny, flawed and just happened to have a disability.

We're here and we're worth listening to.''' ,'''By Year 11, I was a shell of myself. My mum was a teacher in my school, so she could see that I was dimming my light there in comparison to who I was at home.''' ,'''My walk. Let's clarify this: you're not allowed to laugh at my walk but I am. Most times I am in control of my leggies, but occasionally they have a mind of their own, and the little flicks can be very funny.''' ,'''Because of how I walk and I talk, I get abuse on a daily basis.''' ,'''A year living with your parents when you turn 30 has been ripe for comedy.''' ,'''If I want to do something badly enough, I'll make it work, disability or no disability.''' ,'''Every movement ignores disabled people. So, during MeToo no one was talking about the experience of disabled women; during BLM the notion of black disabled people was just ignored and so in terms of comparison we need to have this movement for disabled people.''' ,'''Growing up, I think I always knew I was different.''' ,'''People say: 'Oh, Covid only affects people with pre-existing health conditions,' like that's alright.''' ,'''I grew up in a little seaside town that I thought was absolutely rubbish and I couldn't wait to leave.''' ,'''A lot of people think stand-up comedy is one person performing to an audience, but I love it more when it's a dialogue, an interaction.''' ,'''Without a doubt, my life has been better because of the Disability Act.''' ,'''I'm just one person with one experience, so really on 'Question Time' and in my comedy day job I just say: 'Hello, I'm Rosie, I'm disabled, this is my view of the world.' If you agree with that, if you can take similarities with that, great, but I never assume that I'm grand enough to speak for a fifth of the country.''' ,'''Even though I have always been confident in myself, I have been apologetic for my disability in the past.''' ,'''Disabled people used to be either the good person or the real evil villain. There's no way in between.''' ,'''I'm not that powerful but it's great that I'm allowed to do my job and talk about my life as a disabled person and hopefully sometimes people will laugh at that - sometimes they learn from that and if I do my job really well they laugh and they learn.''' ,'''No one finds me as funny as I find myself!''' ,'''It is so important for children to know that being a little bit wobbly or 'different' doesn't stop somebody from achieving greatness!''' ,'''Growing up, there was nobody in TV or radio that looked like me - that sounded like me.''' ,'''School was tough.

But during lockdown I moved back to Yorkshire with my mum and dad.''' ,]
