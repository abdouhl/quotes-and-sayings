- I just remember I used to go to each tournament to make a couple bucks. I did as a living thing; I got paid to do martial arts, so I'd go to these jiu-jitsu tournaments and make, like, $1000 every time I won the tournament.
- There's a difference between business acquaintances and friends. I consider a friend any time we eat together at the same restaurant, or he's eaten at my house, or I've eaten at his house.
- I just don't want to be one of those guys that's stuck fighting the same opponents again and again.
- If you made the choice to get in there and fight, you have to accept accountability for whatever happens.
- I'm not a UFC athlete. I'm a UFC fighter.
- I made more from sponsorship than I did from fighting. I did that for the longest time.
- It all comes down to money. If the money is right, I'll fight anybody, any time. I'll hit my grandma in the face if the price is right.
- When I grappled, I never even trained for a grappling match.
- TV makes you look taller and fatter.
- One of the things in marriage is you have to understand what appreciation is about, and that'll keep me for longevity. That's why my fans love me, because I appreciate them. Because with no fans, there would be no sport, no fighting for me, no UFC, no Bellator, no Rizin; there'd be nothing without the fans.
- When you think what Big Country could be, I could be that guy.
- I think Lesnar could probably beat Fedor, just from pure size.
- For me, having pneumonia and losing to Mir doesn't sit well.
- Carwin, he seems like he trains for five one-minute rounds. That's his championship fight, apparently.
- The one thing about working with Scott Coker - I've never heard a bad thing about Scott Coker. And that means a lot, especially in our sport.
- Conor McGregor has a beard because of me, because I'm the one who allowed it. If it wasn't for me, none of these guys would have a beard. The same thing with the belly. Fighters who don't look like bodybuilders wouldn't be in the UFC if it wasn't for me. There's a lot of things I've definitely paved the road for.
- Stipe's one of the top guys in the UFC. He wouldn't be in the UFC if he wasn't one of the best in the world.
- A lot of people out there are bullies, and they pick on people and call people names. You need to grow up from that, and you need to become a better person.
- The one thing about the heavyweight division or, actually, just being in the UFC, anybody can win, and anybody can lose. You're competing with the best in the world.
- The thing is that anybody in the heavyweight division can be champion any day just because of one punch.
- I always want to fight for the belt. I don't really care.
- Anytime I come to any organization, I have my sights on the belt.
- I stopped trying to think about how the UFC operates. It's like trying to understand a woman.
- I'm always looking ahead, not backwards.
- Some athletes can master two sports, but most are only good at one.
- I guess there's a showmanship in fighting.
- My goal is to always fight the best in the world and put on a show for the fans.
- MMA is all about putting on a show and entertaining the fans, and that's the one thing I've known from the get-go.
- To me, everything is a joke in MMA when it comes to serious topics because you can't really talk seriously about anything in our business.
- I'm always down to fight a legend of the sport.
- I'm always interested in furthering our sport. Like, I would love to be a correspondent newsperson, somebody who informs the fans a little bit more and able to bring a little more closure to our sport where it's more of a black and white as opposed to the gray area.
- We're in this business to make money, but then nobody wants to talk about how much money we're making. That's serious, but nobody will talk about it.
- On any given day, I know on any given day I can beat anyone else and knock out anyone else out.
- Anybody that was from the old Pride days is a fighter.
- With boxing, sometimes you'll watch the first three rounds, then you'll change the channel and turn it back in the 10th round. With MMA, you have to watch all 15 minutes. You'll want to watch every second.
- If Dana White said he wanted to fight heavyweight, everybody would watch that fight tomorrow just because they want to watch Dana get beat up or win or whatever it is.
- You learn from your mistakes, and you grow from them.
- That was the best part of the Pride guys - they'd go out and entertain. They'd either get knocked out or knock somebody out; they were always trying to finish the fight.
- I probably train just as hard or harder as everybody.
- I always thought the best part about sports was the bigger, faster kids who were supposed to be more athletic than me - I always beat.
- You just got to remember that mine and Dana White's relationship is like we're a husband and wife. I do the man's stuff around the house. I do the fighting, all the man's stuff, and he does all the woman stuff - all the yapping.
- We're in a very individual sport, but they like us not to be so individual. They'd rather have you look like every other cookie cutter guy and have you believe that you're replaceable when you're really not.
- I'm just a fat guy.
- MMA has a lot of those things that you're not allowed to talk about; like, they're completely off-limits. So you have to make a joke out of it.
- Jiu jitsu 101: make the other guy do all the work.
- I go where the fans want me.
- I am a student first, teacher second.
- I have plenty of sponsors, and I'm the first American that Pretorian has sponsored.
- I don't care if I win or lose; I know I'm going to give 110%, and I'm going to hold my head high at the end of the day.
- I just like to be entertaining.
- What brought me to Bellator was Scott Coker, Viacom, and one of my good friends, Mike Kogan.
- I'm usually looking to wrestle and grapple, but I guess the knockouts just happen.
- I definitely envision myself in politics at some point.
- I think just more that it's okay for fighters to have a self-esteem. I think I've kind of shown that that's okay. And as long as you put the hard work in, you can accomplish anything.
- I guess everybody is doing a movie thing, so I'm doing the 'Scorpion King 4.' My role in the movie is as one of the king's guards, with a very original name: Roykus. Apparently, back in the day, everybody's name was 'us,' so 'Roy' plus 'us,' and put a little 'k' in there: Roykus. I'm one of the royal guards, and I do my own stunts like Jackie Chan.
- For me, the biggest thing with Overeem, he's a K-1 champ, Strikeforce champ, DREAM champ, you name it. He's had every belt in there.
- I think the WWE is a great place for professional athletes. Floyd Mayweather did it. Mike Tyson has done it. Even Donald Trump has appeared in the ring.
- I think I'd do pretty well with Fedor.
- I think what it is, is that fighters have become business people. I actually love what I'm doing. When you're a business person, sometimes you think of it as, 'Ah, it's work.' I love what I do, but then, on the other end, some guys do this as a living.
- Do I want a shot at the belt? Yes, of course I do. Put it this way: I am Barry Sanders on the Detroit Lions. You love to watch me, but you'll never see me play in the Super Bowl. It's just one of those things. It's about politics. It's not about fighting.
- If you go into 'The Ultimate Fighter' and you're just gonna go in there to get just one fight and win... the premise is to win the whole thing. When I went in, I wanted to win the thing or be cut.
- We're in the entertainment business. As much as people would like to say it's sport, it's definitely entertainment.
- All I know is that Stipe gave me inspiration because if Stipe can be that UFC champion, and they actually gave him a title shot, then I'm like, 'Ah, I do have a chance.'
- I think with every heavyweight, there's a style that makes for a different fight with different fighters.
- I've never had any complaints about my coaching ability.
- Do I have fat cells on my body? Everybody has fat cells. Do I have more than most other athletes? Probably.
- There's some guys where I'm like, 'I won that fight and only lost because of the judges,' or I got cheated or whatever. I know I'm a better fighter.
- If you've got a mortgage, and you've got bills to pay, you might tend to do some stupid things.
- If you paid me $2 million, I'm sure I could lose my belly. But I don't get paid to look a certain way. I get paid to win fights. That's what I concentrate on.
- I like to actually fight. It's just in my blood.
- I'm always down to give the fans what they want.
- I think Fedor is one of those guys who capitalizes on a lot of people's mistakes, and nobody capitalizes on his mistakes.
- You have all that muscle on you, you're going to get tired. That's why I prefer to be fat.
- With MMA, there are so many ways the fight can go; that's the drama. You don't know what's going to happen next.
- The only thing that's going to be more epic than Roy Nelson fighting Mark Hunt is Roy Nelson fighting for the belt. Those are two fights that I know fans want to see.
- I relate more to 90 percent of America because I look like 'em, act like 'em. I'm not above anybody; I put my pants on the same way. Some guys try to live up to their persona. I'm just me.
- We handle it from both sides of the coin: from the sport aspect and the entertainment aspect. You gotta have both because we're if not doing solid ratings, we're not going to be on TV.
- If you can't beat me, you need to get some new coaches or something.
- I'm not surprised to be the coach on 'The Ultimate Fighter.'
- I think WWE is a great.
- I just want to be agreeable; I want to be a pleaser. And that's all I want to do. I want to please the fans or the haters. One or the other.
- What's wrong with being a two-sport athlete? You've got Deion Sanders. You've got Bo Jackson. You've got Michael Jordan; he wasn't a very good baseball player. There's nothing wrong with crossing over.
- I only fight clean fighters. I'll fight anybody in the UFC that's clean. Or dirty. Or clean.
- Everybody hates a whiner.
- I've always looked up to Big Nog. He's a legend in the sport and has the mentality that so many fans love, and it's what got me into fighting. He's a man's man and a real fighter.
- I've coached UFC champions and stuff before I ever started fighting.
- I think I'd probably shine really well in a team sport, but as everybody knows, I don't handle politics very well. A lot of team sports has a lot of politics. Individual sports, it's all about me.
- Our sport was founded on the tournament.
- I'm one of those heavyweights who'd like to fight as often as possible.
- I can always fight the best in the world.
- I'd fight anyone I've ever lost to.
- A good wrestler, with good jiu jitsu and great boxing, can beat Fedor.
- If you're a true MMA fan, you're going to want to have Fight Pass the same way TV and movie fans have Netflix.
- There are athletes out there trying to get every advantage they can, including things like muscle and low-fat percentages. I feel if I'm the better fighter, I'm the better fighter.
- Stupid can't fix stupid.
- The one thing that always sucks about me is that I'm just a fighter, and I just love to fight.
- Just go out there against the best fighters in the world and see where I stand. That's what I want.
- You'd prefer to fight somebody that you really would rather derail their whole career.
- I really enjoyed playing rugby. I loved the camaraderie with the other athletes. It was kind of like fighting. Team fighting.
- I'm more than a fighter and not just a pretty face.
