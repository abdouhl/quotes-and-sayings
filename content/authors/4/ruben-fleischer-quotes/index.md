quotes = ['''It's tough to make a sequel that stands up to the original especially one that has, over the course of time, become a bit of a cult favorite.''' ,'''We didn't want to make a movie that excluded any fans. 'Venom' fans actually are of all ages, and so we wanted to be inclusive to all the fans that were excited about the movie.''' ,'''I love music videos, and I think maybe it's my favorite format.''' ,'''As far as 'Venom,' we took some license with this because I don't think we know a lot about him from his days on planet Klyntar in the comic. But in our movie we thought maybe he could also be somebody who's a little bit of a loser, a loner, and doesn't love being subordinate.''' ,'''I'm a huge fan of comic books movies and comics, and so for me it was a real dream to get to make a movie in this world, and certainly to get to make a movie with Venom as its titular character.''' ,'''I have a music-video background, and I feel like the responsibility of a music-video director is to do something that hasn't been done before in a really cool visual way. So much innovation has come in filmmaking through music videos.''' ,'''I feel like there's a true spirit of individuality in Portland that's inherent to the place.''' ,'''I've had a really hard time dealing with 35mm. I greatly prefer HD.''' ,'''Venom is such a great character, it will be fun to see who he tangles with along the way.''' ,'''And my idols in music videos are people like Michel Gondry and Spike Jonze and Johnathan Glazer and David Fincher and that's always kind of been my reference point in music video and commercial directors.''' ,'''I've definitely pitched some viral ideas and do have a pretty good understanding of the Web.''' ,'''I thought 'I Am Legend' did a really great job of it, and 'Omega Man,' that concept of an empty world.''' ,'''My first time out of the gate, I made three movies in four years, and they were all very back to back to back.''' ,'''What's great about 'Spy Hunter' is that we have an amazing title, an awesome car, and a great theme song, and we can use that to launch a new franchise that hopefully will compete with the other ones but just be kind of the more fun, video game version of a spy movie.''' ,'''I definitely never intended to do a zombie movie.''' ,'''Bill Murray, we've got to get people worthy to be on the screen with him, as opposed to just a bunch of random... with no disrespect... but a bunch of random local actors.''' ,'''I started out as an assistant to a director on two movies, Miguel Arteta. The movies I worked on were 'Chuck and Buck' and 'The Good Girl.' I didn't even know I wanted to be a director until I started working with Miguel.''' ,'''Zombies are kind of a perennial.''' ,'''Yeah, I feel lucky to have the opportunity to try different things.''' ,'''I'm not as clever as J.J. Abrams and those guys who fill it with all of these things for people to find.''' ,'''I basically went from finishing 'Venom.' I had a week off with my family. And then went straight into prep on 'Zombieland 2.'''' ,'''Sure, I came up under Mike White, and Miguel Arteta; I was Mike White's assistant on 'Dawson's Creek.'''' ,'''As a comic book fan, I've seen all the comic book movies.''' ,'''Yeah, I love 'Boardwalk Empire.'''' ,'''I read pretty much every 'Venom' comic that exists.''' ,'''I think the filmmakers that I love are ones that cross genres and do different thinks, the way that David O. Russell can do something like 'Flirting With Disaster' but then go do 'Three Kings' which is like an incredibly visual film - that's a huge reference point.''' ,'''If you've loved a girl your entire life and you've been afraid to tell her, don't wait because you never know what might happen.''' ,'''I get really excited thinking about being in the world without a lot of people.''' ,'''When I started trying to become a director, I started shooting low budget short films, 50-dollar music videos, making my own stuff. That eventually led to commercials.''' ,'''I think sometimes when things have too much time to develop you overthink it and you start making changes that aren't necessary.''' ,'''We're definitely planning a huge world with this 'Venom' story, and we want to be able to satisfy our own desires and the desires of our fans to explore all of the beloved characters from the universe.''' ,'''That 'Zombieland' thing was pretty great. I think I didn't realize just how lucky I was after that first movie, to have something so special and to have a cast that's so special.''' ,'''There is more than enough 'Venom' to go around. Venom is a really huge character, and Hardy is an amazing actor, so there is plenty to mine just from Tom's performance, the character and the world he inhabits.''' ,'''I love 'Bond' movies, I love spy movies.''' ,'''If you have somebody who can just do everything easily, then it's kind of boring. If you're handcuffed to a chair and you've got to fight while your handcuffed, or something like that, it just adds a cool element.''' ,'''Like, I've worked on movies where you go in every day and you know that what you're shooting isn't very good to start with and then you have to figure it out, and that's way harder.''' ,'''I've always loved the genre of gangster films.''' ,'''I think any opportunity you can to employ some visual technique, go for it.''' ,'''I've always been fascinated by history.''' ,'''The mass of Venom. I mean, he's like a big, foreboding, physical presence. Actually, let me correct myself - the eyes, the tongue, the mouth, those are his most distinguishing traits, and so making those look as photoreal and true to the comics as we possibly could was super important to me.''' ,'''I started with digital filmmaking. I've pretty much only done digital filmmaking.''' ,'''Zombie purists don't even call our zombies zombies, because to be a zombie you have to be undead. That's something zombie purists can fight about for years and years to come.''' ,'''The trickiest thing is that a lot of times in 'Venom' comics, they'll reveal part of Eddie, and he'll be like a Venom body with an Eddie head, or he'll do that classic split frame face.''' ,'''I come from music videos and commercials, where style is a big part of the whole world. I've always tried to add that to whatever I'm doing.''' ,''''The Dark Knight' does such a great job of delivering an intense, action-packed film that didn't pull any punches.''' ,'''My first job in Hollywood was as a PA in the writers room of 'Dawson's Creek,' and from that early experience on, I've always had an intense appreciation for the energy, creativity and process of making television.''' ,'''Venom' is a standalone character who has so much attitude, menace and ferocity. He's also really funny in the comics and in our movie. He's a really compelling guy that can completely stand on his own. When he's played by Tom Hardy, and Eddie Brock is his partner, that relationship is enough for one movie.''' ,'''I think we can all agree it would be pretty amazing to see Spider-Man and Venom face off in a film.''' ,'''You know, duality has always been a strong theme throughout 'Venom'-focused stories, whether it's in the comics or in movies, and that's something I think that Tom Hardy's played with in a lot of his work.''' ,'''I work really hard and have rolled up my sleeves for a long time to get the opportunities I've had.''' ,'''With '30 Minutes or Less,' there was a conscious decision on my part to make it a little less stylized. I wanted it to feel like an '80s action movie.''' ,'''I haven't done a movie without a member of the original cast of 'Zombieland' - they've all been in every movie I've done.''' ,'''Sometimes in L.A., we get accused of being superficial. I feel like Portland's the opposite, in that there's a greater depth of character, and sense of self.''' ,'''I've always been drawn to the more antihero superheroes.''' ,'''I feel like a zombie movie is kind of like the gold to hear movie.''' ,'''I guess as a long time fan of 'Venom,' as soon as I heard they were making a standalone movie I got really excited at the prospect of being involved.''' ,'''It was fun playing with those jumps and the flashbacks in 'Zombieland,' but I don't think you need it to make a good movie. It's fun to just do a more straightforward one.''' ,'''I love TV.''' ,'''Some time after 'Gangster Squad,' after I'd made a couple other movies, I was like, 'In retrospect that 'Zombieland' experience was about as good as it can get, both between the cast and the world of the movie and the way it was received.' I was like, 'We should probably do another 'Zombieland.'''' ,'''I've got to give a lot of credit to my cinematographer, Chung-hoon Chung, who is a master and among other things shot 'Old Boy,' which is a very famous single-take fight scene. He's really a true master.''' ,'''I think Jack Nicholson in 'Chinatown' is a very funny character, but I would never call that a comedy.''' ,'''It's like somehow my favorite filmmakers, you know, bounce between genres. Like if you look at a career of somebody like Soderbergh or Danny Boyle or the Coen's. I mean, it goes - there's no real through line other than just their style, but the type of genre or the type of subject matter seems to go all over.''' ,'''I just want to make sure whatever I take on, I can deliver.''' ,'''I have this horrible habit of just pressing online bookmarks that are at the top of my browser like ad infinitum.''' ,'''Traditionally in zombie movies, one of the main characters dies.''' ,'''He's an American treasure, I would be honored to fight Tom Hanks.''' ,'''You know, the comedic and horror thing was the key to 'Zombieland,' which is a comedy first.''' ,'''Some of the greatest movies of all time are within this genre, 'The Godfather,' and 'Goodfellas,' and 'Untouchables' and there's just so many classic gangster movies that I was always such a fan of.''' ,'''I was working in commercials and music videos, always with the goal of working in feature films.''' ,'''Venom,' we worked all the way up until the release. It was one of the latest things you could possibly push the schedule to. We actually finished it two weeks before it had to go everywhere throughout the world.''' ,]
