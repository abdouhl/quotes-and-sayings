quotes = ['''It was clear soon after his election that Obama, like FDR, wanted to start dealing with the economic crisis immediately after his inauguration.''' ,'''You can't enjoy light verse with a heavy heart.''' ,'''Listen once in a while. It's amazing what you can hear.''' ,'''A skillful playwright might have a good time with the story of the assassination of President William McKinley, and especially with the three most flamboyant political figures involved: Mark Hanna, Theodore Roosevelt, and Emma Goldman.''' ,'''American foreign policy had still not recovered from its victory over communism when George W. Bush and Condoleezza Rice took over at the White House in 2001.''' ,'''Situation comedy on television has thrived for years on 'canned' laughter, grafted by gaglines by technicians using records of guffawing audiences that have been dead for years.''' ,'''Live by publicity, you'll probably die by publicity.''' ,'''Children rarely want to know who their parents were before they were parents, and when age finally stirs their curiosity, there is no parent left to tell them.''' ,'''Reporters thrive on the world's misfortune.

They think Reagan is too naive, too innocent, to grasp the intellectual complexities of cold war strategy.''' ,'''People seem to enjoy things more when they know a lot of other people have been left out of the pleasure.''' ,'''Don't try to make children grow up to be like you, or they may do it.''' ,'''When it comes to cars, only two varieties of people are possible - cowards and fools.''' ,'''Objects can be classified scientifically into three major categories: those that don't work, those that break down and those that get lost.''' ,'''Gerald Boyd was a classic specimen of the self-made man.

Too many authorities have assured it that its days are numbered, too many good newspapers are in ruins.''' ,'''Caution: These verses may be hazardous to your solemnity.''' ,'''The best discussion of trouble in boardroom and business office is found in newspapers' own financial pages and speeches by journalists in management jobs.''' ,'''A day spent praising the earth and lamenting man's pollutionist history makes you feel like a superior, sensitive soul.''' ,'''In America nothing dies easier than tradition.''' ,'''I gave up on new poetry myself 30 years ago when most of it began to read like coded messages passing between lonely aliens in a hostile world.''' ,'''Newspaper people, once celebrated as founts of ribald humor and uncouth fun, have of late lost all their gaiety, and small wonder.''' ,'''Few expected very much of Franklin Roosevelt on Inauguration Day in 1933.
