- The funnier the material, the funnier I could make it.
- The original Dean Martin Comedy Hour handed me some hysterical sketches. I've got highlights on tons of these variety shows, given to me by their great writers. I'd love to be doing all that again.
- I got everybody on my side through comedy.
- Around 7 years old, we girls took dancing lessons, joined the Brownies, the Girl Scouts, the 4H Club.
- My nephews all look at me differently now. Before, they couldn't relate to me, and now I'm like a god.
- I created the characters from what I read in the script. I decided how I should talk, accent, no accent, my own voice, or a created voice. Then, I visualize what I should look like.
- I really learned the power of the tube on Sesame Street and how it can influence a very young mind.
- I really enjoyed doing the voice of Nose Marie on the cartoon series Pound Puppies. Fun, FUN cast.
- It's so very important as to what a child watches on TV. I feel for every parent that knows this, and cares, because they only have control of the child's viewing to a certain point.
- Life has all sorts of hills and valleys, and sometimes you don't end up doing what you had your heart set out on, but sometimes that's even better!
- I can laugh on cue, and it sounds real. People laugh with me.
