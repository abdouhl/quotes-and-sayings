- My point is, there's no sense trying to squeeze something out of your swing if you can let your clubs do the shotmaking for you.
- Nobody but you and your caddie care what you do out there, and if your caddie is betting against you, he doesn't care, either.
- You can talk to a fade but a hook won't listen.

- When you really deep down look at it, we go to bed every night, get up every morning, stay here for 70 or 80 years, and then we die.
- Every shot feels like the first shot of the day. If I'm on the range hitting shot after shot, I can hit them just as good as I did when I was 30. But out on the course, your body changes between shots. You get out of the cart, and you've got this 170-yard 5-iron over a bunker, and it goes about 138.
- I love watching Anthony Kim play, but I'm not a fan of the way he grips down a good two inches on his full-swing shots. Choking down lightens the club's swing weight and effectively makes the shaft stiffer. It also makes it difficult to hit the ball high enough for all situations.
- My divorce came to me as a complete surprise. That's what happens when you haven't been home in eighteen years.
- Jack Nicklaus liked to curve the ball by opening or closing the clubface at address. I never felt I was good enough to do it his way. I didn't like changing my swing path, either, which some guys do. There's only one really reliable way to curve the ball: Change your hand position at address.
- I'm going to win so much money this year, my caddie will make the top twenty money winner's list.
- When you're poor, you know nothing about the future, you know nothing about the world, nothing that goes on outside 300 yards around you.
- In case of a thunderstorm, stand in the middle of the fairway and hold up a one iron. Not even God can hit a one iron.
- I stay away from the telephone if at all possible.
- If you are caught on a golf course during a storm and are afraid of lightning, hold up a 1-iron. Not even God can hit a 1-iron.
- Seve Ballesteros was the best trouble-shot player who ever lived. It didn't matter how far in the woods you put that guy, he'd find a way to get out. But Seve inadvertently put a lot of big numbers on the scorecards of average players, because he inspired them to take dumb chances.
- I love watching Anthony Kim play, but I'm not a fan of the way he grips down a good two inches on his full-swing shots. Choking down lightens the club's swingweight and effectively makes the shaft stiffer.
- All my life I had a rapport with black caddies.
- Chi Chi Rodriguez had as good a pair of hands as anybody I ever saw, and more shots than you can imagine. But Chi Chi had a habit of turning simple shots into difficult ones.
- I've traveled the world and been about everywhere you can imagine. There's not anything I'm scared of except my wife.
- The most interesting guy I've ever played with was King Hassan of Morocco. I went over there on a trip in the early 1970s, and the King and I played five holes. I've never been that nervous in my life.
- I remember the first time going to St. Jude. I didn't like going there because the children were ill, and it just broke my heart. It makes you test your religion when you see something like that. But the Lord doesn't want just old people. You know, He wants some young people, too, and good people. He takes care of them. He takes care of them.

- If I could do anything over, I'd have spent more time with my first set of children. I would have taken more quality time with them, for sure.
- Jack Nicklaus liked to curve the ball by opening or closing the clubface at address. I never felt I was good enough to do it his way. I didn't like changing my swing path, either, which some guys do.
- I think a lot of Jim Thorpe, the Olympian, and his accomplishments.
- Sure, I've felt racism. I think everybody has prejudice. When I was growing up, the dark Mexican kids weren't allowed in the public swimming pool in Dallas. My light-skinned friend got in, and he laughed at us. It didn't seem like a big deal, because we didn't know any different. So I never ran into anything that actually scarred me.
- The older I get the better I used to be!
- I never played much golf as a kid. I caddied quite a bit but never got serious into golf until about age 15.
- I never think of yesterday. Can't do anything about it. I'm a positive guy. When you really deep down look at it, we go to bed every night, get up every morning, stay here for 70 or 80 years, and then we die.
- I'm actually a very quiet person off the golf course. I talk 150 miles per hour when I'm at the course, but when in private I very seldom ever open my mouth.
- Michael Jordan was a tremendous basketball player.
- Pressure is when you play for five dollars a hole with only two in your pocket.
- I always loved hitting a low fade to a back-right pin with the wind howling from the right. Not many guys could get it close in that situation, because they kept it low by just putting the ball back in their stance. You see, playing the ball back turns you into a one-trick pony - you can only hit hooks.
- I believe in reincarnation. In my last life I was a peasant. Next time around, I'd like to be an eagle. Who hasn't dreamed they could fly? They're a protected species, too.
- Yes, I think I have the best swing on the Tour. Why have scores comedown in the last ten years? Partly because they are imitating me.
- My wife doesn't care what I do when I'm away, as long as I don't have a good time.
- I have an orthopedic pillow that's made out of a sponge material. I have a plate in my throat, and I have to be careful or I could end up with a bad neck in the morning. That pillow is a must everywhere I go.
- If your concentration is getting bad, take up bass fishing. It will really improve your ability to focus. If you aren't ready when that fish hits, you can't set the hook.
- I'm not out there just to be dancing around. I expect to win every time I tee up.
- When it comes to the game of life, I figure I've played the whole course.
- How can they beat me? I've been struck by lightning, had two back operations, and been divorced twice.
- I still sweat. My guts are still grinding out there. Sometimes I have enough cotton in my mouth to knit a sweater.
- I use an Arnold Palmer putter that was probably built back in 1954.
- Only bad golfers are lucky. They're the ones bouncing balls off trees, curbs, turtles and cars. Good golfers have bad luck. When you hit the ball straight, a funny bounce is bound to be unlucky.
- I just feel like I have when I started making a lot of money, I started spreading it out to people. Mickelson, the whole deal, the over-tip: if I see a guy that looks like he needs a hand out or something, I'll pull something out and give him something.
- I will fall in love with any golf course that you have to drive the ball straight. You understand what I'm saying? That's my advantage. My advantage wasn't putting. In fact, I wasn't even a great putter or a good putter.

- Green synthetic practice mats are the worst thing for your golf game that I know of. You can hit six inches behind the ball and not even know it, because the ball still gets airborne. Practice nets are awful, too. Swing a weighted club instead.
