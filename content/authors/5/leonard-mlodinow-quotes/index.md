quotes = ['''In physics, all can you do is predict the consequences of physical laws.''' ,'''Politicians often misuse science for political ends and to pursue their own agenda.''' ,'''We all know that looks matter. What most of us don't understand is just how much looks matter and how difficult it is for us to ignore a person's appearance when making a social judgment.''' ,'''A failure doesn't mean you are unworthy, nor does it preclude success on the next try.''' ,'''By subliminal, I mean things that occur in our world that are below the threshold of consciousness but do have a psychological effect on us.''' ,'''Scientists attach great importance to the human capacity for spoken language. But we also have a parallel track of nonverbal communication, which may reveal more than our carefully chosen words, and sometimes be at odds with them.''' ,'''Our subliminal mental processes operate outside awareness because they arise in these portions of our mind that are inaccessible to our conscious self; their inaccessibility is due to the architecture of the brain rather than because they have been subject to Freudian motivational forces like repression.''' ,'''We perceive, we remember our experiences, we make judgments, we act - and in all of these endeavors, we are influenced by factors that we aren't aware of.''' ,'''Whatever I've worked on, I've always tried to make my writing personal. I think that's what makes my books somewhat different from what other scientists are doing. You have to tie concepts into everyday life, or they just won't be interesting for readers.''' ,'''I find that predicting the course of our lives is like predicting the weather. You might be able to predict your future in the short term, but the longer you look ahead, the less likely you are to be correct.''' ,'''Whether it's fiction or nonfiction, writing takes me to another world.''' ,'''I think the fun of following the movie box office and stocks is very similar to the fun of sports - all three combine passion and unpredictability.''' ,'''Every aspect of our lives plays out in two versions: one conscious, which we are constantly aware of, and the other unconscious, which remains hidden from us.''' ,'''Language is handy, but we humans have social and emotional connections that transcend words and are communicated - and understood - without conscious thought.''' ,'''Just as our brains fill in the details of an image our eyes record only roughly, so, too, do our brains employ tricks we are unaware of to fill in details about people we don't know intimately.''' ,'''Intentionality and talent always matter. An extraordinary feat is certainly made more likely by someone's focus, hard work, etc. But chance also matters.''' ,'''In all our perceptions, from vision to hearing, to the pictures we build of people's character, our unconscious mind starts from whatever objective data is available to us - usually spotty - and helps to shape and construct the more complete picture we consciously perceive.''' ,'''One of the most surprising forms of nonverbal communication is the way we automatically adjust the amount of time we spend looking into another's eyes as a function of our relative social position.''' ,'''Social connection is such a basic feature of human experience that when we are deprived of it, we suffer.''' ,''''Subliminal' is about how we misinterpret our behavior because we're unaware of what our unconscious minds are doing.''' ,'''Social rejection doesn't just cause emotional pain; it affects our physical being.''' ,'''One of the things your unconscious mind does for you - and it's a great gift - is it gives you extra courage to view the outer world and it does that by giving you an extra-special view of yourself.''' ,'''Nonverbal communication forms a social language that is in many ways richer and more fundamental than our words.''' ,'''My best subjects were chemistry and math.''' ,'''We routinely participate in elaborate nonverbal exchanges even when we are not consciously aware of doing so.''' ,'''We unwittingly judge products by their boxes, books by their covers, and even corporation's annual reports by their nice glossy finish.''' ,'''People spend a lot of time talking and thinking about how members of the opposite sex look, but very little time paying attention to how they sound. To our unconscious minds, however, voice is very important.''' ,'''We all know that looks matter, and modern politicians have always assumed that their battles are decided on both substance and image.''' ,'''Listeners instinctively detect that when we lower the usual pitch of our voice, we are sad, and when we raise it, we are angry or fearful.''' ,'''I've always loved science, as far back as I can remember. I was very, very curious about how everything worked: the world, the physical universe, chemistry, law. So it was only natural to be curious about how our mind works.''' ,'''Non-human primates spend hours a day grooming each other. And with humans, touching is also important. It's a way to form bonds and connect in modern society. But you can also speed up the use of conscious purposes once you're aware of that, and it can be manipulated.''' ,'''We have emotions for a reason; for instance, imagine pain. You have pain so that if you touch something that's hot, or if you slam your hand with a hammer, you will pull your hand away and not do that again.''' ,'''I always liked movies, so I started writing for Hollywood, but my day job was physics.''' ,'''Touch is our most highly developed sense when we are born, and it remains a fundamental mode of communication throughout a baby's first year and an important influence throughout a person's life.''' ,'''The truth is that our unconscious minds are active, purposeful, and independent. Hidden they may be, but their effects are anything but, for they play a critical role in shaping the way our conscious minds experience and respond to the world.''' ,'''People intuitively realize that there is strength in numbers and take comfort in the company of others, especially in times of anxiety or need.''' ,'''I believe in a kind of God. I think all scientists, in a way, believe in a certain God, in a certain order of nature.''' ,'''The attacks on global warming are no different than the attacks the cigarettes companies used to use to say that cigarettes don't cause cancer.''' ,'''One thing that feeds into the way you experience the social world is your mood - and one thing that affects your mood is the weather.''' ,'''We all know that players will hit a few more home runs than usual in some years and a few less in others. But the mathematics of chance also predicts that some years they'll hit a lot more, and some years a lot less.''' ,'''The pitch, timbre, volume, speed, and cadence of your voice, the speed with which you speak, and even the way you modulate pitch and loudness, are all hugely influential factors in how convincing you are and how people judge your state of mind and character.''' ,'''Touch seems to be such an important tool for enhancing social cooperation and affiliation that we have evolved a special physical route along which those subliminal feelings of social connection travel from skin to brain.''' ,'''If memories were indeed like what a camera records, they could be forgotten, or they could fade so that they are no longer clear and vivid. But it would be difficult to explain how people could have memories that are both clear and vivid while also being wrong. Yet that happens, and it is not infrequent.''' ,'''Evolution is among the most well-established theories in the scientific community. To doubt it sounds to biologists as absurd as denying relativity does to physicists.''' ,'''French culture is known for many great attributes, some of which probably have nothing to do with food, wine, and romance.''' ,'''I believe there is true expertise in some endeavors, and not in others. There is obviously no such thing as expertise in predicting the results of coin tosses, but there is expertise in predicting the behavior of lasers.''' ,'''You have to have passion for a subject to write about it. You can't expect your readers to feel any excitement if it's nothing but a boring writing exercise for you.''' ,'''I just really loved films and thought I should be writing screenplays.''' ,'''On the unconscious level, touch seems to impart a subliminal sense of caring and connection.''' ,'''We should keep in mind that it is easy to concoct stories explaining the past or to become confident about dubious scenarios of the future. We should view both explanations and prophecies with skepticism.''' ,'''One of the ways we interact with other human beings and form social bonds is through touch, and probably most of us are not aware of the extreme importance of touch.''' ,'''When judging a product, we rarely have exhaustive scientific data to go by. As a result, if we are to form a complete picture, we must fill in the blanks, just as we must in our visual perception.''' ,'''Of course our feelings matter. But emotional decisions are usually not the best ones. On the other hand, your emotions can affect your decisions whether you like it or not because the effects can occur on the unconscious level.''' ,'''Expressive speech, with modulation in pitch and volume, and a minimum of noticeable pauses, boosts credibility and enhances the impression of intelligence.''' ,]
