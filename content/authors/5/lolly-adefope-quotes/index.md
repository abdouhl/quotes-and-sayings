quotes = ['''I'm a Virgo. That is me. To a tee. Me and Beyonce. And Amy Winehouse! Same birthday.''' ,'''Not many stores can boast the unmatched variety that Boots has.''' ,'''All my characters are like, weird people. Weird, un-self aware people.''' ,'''I think there should be an app that's like Tinder, but it's to connect people at the same bars/restaurants who are both waiting for someone that's running late.''' ,'''I live with my boyfriend, but we never cook together. It's too stressful.''' ,'''Boys can essentially wee anywhere, and my very scientific theory is that this privilege leads to some of the mind-blowing confidence they show in later life - for example, the number of guys I've known who've decided to 'give comedy a go' after finding out that I'm a comedian.''' ,'''If I was doing standup I would worry that someone would think I was being preachy, whereas, with a character, it always tends to be the opposite of what I think. You can get away with things.''' ,'''Comedy should always evolve; it's so easy to punch down.''' ,''''The Miracle Workers' was the first time I've been on a big American TV set, so that felt very epic.''' ,'''It's easy to look at a show with a diverse cast that's touching on topics that haven't been talked about and to think, 'Oh, this is just political correctness; this is just box ticking.'''' ,'''TV is kind of messed up in terms of stereotypes and who plays the leading man and leading lady.''' ,'''I still get excited by the same clothes I did when I first started going to vintage shops. But I think as I get older, I realize how much nicer it is to have 10 great outfits rather than 1000 tops and dresses that are all in a pile I cry in every time I get ready to go out.''' ,'''I think with 'Ghosts' it's slightly affected my image of what ghosts would be. Before I didn't really think about it that much.''' ,'''I'm very willing to cut people off if they betray the people that I love.''' ,'''Much has been written on the subject of self-care, and what truly counts as such; one woman's double gin and tonic is another woman's culturally appropriated yoga retreat.''' ,'''I want to keep the British side of my sense of humor.''' ,'''I watched a lot of comedy when I was younger.''' ,'''There was a point when I was doing loads of shows that weren't getting a series two and I was like, 'One day, I'll be in a show that comes back.'''' ,'''When you first start gigging, it's about finding an audience.''' ,'''When I'm in Portland, I meet people who are hairdressers, they have a wonderful life, they go on hikes and do loads of things. Their career is just the thing they do to pay the bills. They enjoy it, but it's not this huge, continuous journey of trying to make it. And I'm attracted to that lifestyle, of just having a nice life.''' ,'''There's something really special, and addictive, about making that connection with an audience - knowing that they may never have seen you before, and may never see you again, but that for those moments you've been able to unite them all in laughter, and provide the escape that lies in that involuntary response.''' ,'''The thing I love about comedy is that it challenges you.''' ,'''It is fun to play someone who likes everyone and is liked by most people, or is at least tolerated.''' ,'''I know my strengths are doing a weird accent or having weird mannerisms so when I have to play a normal human being, I'm like, 'this is too hard.'''' ,'''Essentially, we live in a patriarchy where women are being distracted from realizing their full potential by the amount of time they spend waiting in toilet queues.''' ,'''Now when I travel, I'm more adventurous. If I find myself creeping back into that 'not going to leave the hotel' vibe, I take baby steps, like having a nice dinner on my own or getting my nails done.''' ,'''I've been quite lucky, I've done very cool projects, but knowing there are others who are put off because they don't see people who look like them, I feel like it's our responsibility to change that.''' ,'''You can hit the comedy, but a lot of 'Shrill' is also emotional.''' ,'''You don't get white comedians being asked to talk about their race in their shows. I should be given the same agency to talk about what I want to talk about.''' ,'''Whereas acting, you have to wait for someone else to give you the opportunity to do it, in comedy, you can just pick out your own strengths and be like, I'm just going to show the best bits to the world.''' ,'''I thought I would be too vulnerable on stage doing standup. I didn't want to get up there and say: 'This is who I am. I want you to like me.'''' ,'''I've learned to adapt to a situation, to make the best of it.''' ,'''When I was about six years old I decided to make a teddy bears' picnic in our dining room, so I set up 10 dolls and teddy bears around the table and made them each an apricot jam sandwich. It was only when I sat down that I realized I'd made 10 apricot jam sandwiches for 10 inanimate objects, and that I'd have to eat them all.''' ,'''Adam Hess - he thinks that if you swallow enough chewing gum you go from being left-handed to being right-handed, and vice versa, but he is my best friend anyway.''' ,'''I had always wanted to do comedy, but didn't know where to start - all I knew was that Edinburgh was where it happened.''' ,'''It's freeing to be that person who people turn around to look at, wondering who could have a laugh that loud.''' ,'''I like art that's simple but feels kind of genius - like David Shrigley or David Hockney.''' ,'''There's nothing quite like exiting a toilet cubicle and seeing a girl running towards you with her hand over her mouth.''' ,'''It wasn't until a few years ago, when I was going through old Facebook pictures with a friend, and happened upon a photo of a monkey at a zoo that had been tagged as me by an old housemate, that I realized I'd normalized so much racism.''' ,'''I'm allergic to a lot of fruit and veg, but if I hide them in a drink, somehow my body doesn't notice.''' ,'''Comedy is a cool thing, because, at least in my experience, if you're good at it and people know, they'll find out about you.''' ,'''I didn't get into drama school after university. Looking back, I think I was really bad.''' ,'''Fat people aren't just fat people; they have so many layers to them, just like anybody else, that I think should be explored.''' ,'''The thing that attracted me the most was comedy acting and people like Catherine Tate and Olivia Colman; people doing funny voices and accents.''' ,'''When I was in Year 10 I saw a girl on 'X Factor' with a really great, huge afro, so I went to the hairdresser's to get a weave and achieve the same look. She somehow convinced me to get colored extensions that were way too short, so I ended up looking like 'Annie.'''' ,'''Yeah, Patrice Johnson is an incredible actress. She makes it real easy to cry when she cries.''' ,'''I remember someone told me Donald Trump may not leave after the election. It seemed like a fictional, almost science-fiction idea.''' ,'''It is annoying that some people only see black women as role models to other black women, rather than as role models to lots of different people.''' ,'''I want to sometimes talk about race and sometimes not talk about race, but mainly just do silly voices and pretend to be like strange people, and having people be like, 'That's fine, we accept that.'''' ,'''When I was younger and went on holiday with my family, I'd be almost agoraphobic. I would just want to be on my Game Boy and not speak to anyone.''' ,'''I wanted to do comedy, but I didn't grow up wanting to be a standup.''' ,'''I wanted to do standup, but I was too nervous.

The appetite for more diverse stories is getting bigger.''' ,'''I still maintain that Looney Tunes is the funniest program ever made.''' ,'''You want to find the balance of acknowledging privilege and acknowledging the disadvantages that you have.''' ,'''I think sometimes as an actor your career and life are kind of dependent on other people's decisions, what other people tell you, what time other people tell you to get up in the morning, what lines people tell you to say.''' ,'''I was a very dramatic pre-teen.''' ,'''Performing a play or a musical or something is obviously an incredible rush, but I don't think you get that immediate response like with comedy unless you get a round of applause or whatever.''' ,'''My friends wonder how I have the patience to engage with people on Twitter about topics such as diversity and why black British history should be taught in schools: surely it's exhausting? And they're right.''' ,'''Rihanna has revolutionized the beauty and lingerie industries, and that has an impact on the mental health of young women, who are measured by their beauty.''' ,'''If I'm doing different accents, I feel like I'm acting. If I'm doing my own accent, I feel like I'm saying someone else's dialogue as myself.''' ,'''I love Nooworks, Mara Hoffman, and Monki, and ASOS just for the joy of ordering a pair of shoes in bed at 11 P. M. and them arriving the next day.''' ,'''I'm starting to play lots more naturalistic, realistic people than when I first started. Maybe because I was doing character comedy shows, and I was doing slightly weird, oddball characters with weird accents, those were the characters that I got cast to play - which made perfect sense.''' ,'''Despite having lived in London for most of my life - and being a huge fan of dancing and drinking in the street - I've never been to Notting Hill carnival.''' ,'''Making people laugh, I think, is very powerful.''' ,'''Boots radiates a unique kind of class - not a glamour, but enough self-respect to not degrade itself with an in-store radio station.''' ,'''For me, it's comfort over style always, ladies!''' ,'''I think not getting into Cambridge was possibly the best thing that could have happened to me.''' ,'''I'm such a good best friend.''' ,'''Going to Edinburgh when I was at university and seeing people who were my age just getting up and doing what they wanted to do, was quite a clincher for me.''' ,'''There is something quite amusing about someone who is relentlessly positive and wants to be everyone's friend in a cynical world.''' ,'''I'm hyperaware that I'm traveling as a Black woman, but I try to remind myself that there's a lot to be gained by stepping out of my comfort zone.''' ,'''Steve Buscemi's the coolest man in the world, and Daniel Radcliffe is the sweetest man in the world.''' ,'''Certain directors have that eye where something is beautiful as well as funny.''' ,'''Making comedy is a privilege, so you should be doing something no one else can do. That's when it feels like art; it's a personal expression and it's being done in a unique way.''' ,'''Like catching a glimpse of the McDonald's golden arches after a night out, when I see the blue and white Boots sign in the distance I feel comforted.''' ,'''I have no brand loyalty to toothpaste. It's absolutely a different brand every tube.''' ,'''If you're just making people laugh, that can be one-dimensional. You have to bring something artistic into it, so it's working on another plane or is more complex.''' ,'''University was fun in many ways - new people, a new town, a bigger Vodka Revs bar. But my three years there also involved navigating a cacophony of questions such as, 'But why isn't there a White History Month? Like, genuinely? I just wanna know?'''' ,'''In a nightclub, the women's loos are not just the women's loos; they're where temporary female friendships are forged.''' ,'''It always felt that there were a lot of shows where there was a white lead female, who was attractive, and then I was being offered the kooky friend. And it was just like, 'Why can't this be the other way around?'''' ,'''A lot of people just kind of act as if it's their God-given right to be overpaid and on TV, but it just feels like there has to be a level of like: 'This is an exciting thing to be doing.' It's not just something that we're owed.''' ,'''Our generation are always go-getting, hustling.''' ,'''One evening, I read David Nicholls' book 'One Day,' because our flat was a few streets down from Rankeillor Street, where the first chapter is set.''' ,'''You have to look at the effects of something like 'Little Britain,' of how the stereotypes it pushes has impacted society and the way people interact with each other.''' ,'''I was desperate for comedy to seep into me somehow, convinced that being surrounded by it would give me the confidence to go onstage myself.''' ,'''I don't think that not seeing black women in comedy held me back, but I think subconsciously I never really thought that it was a career that I would definitely go into.''' ,'''You can still be sexist even though you're not necessarily talking about women.''' ,]
