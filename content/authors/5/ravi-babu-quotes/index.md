- For someone who gets into the character and shoots for long hours, it is pretty difficult to cut off from the character and return to their normal life.
- I am a big fan of action films and I want to make one in this genre.
- Spirits are always shown in the dark. I wondered what they do in the daytime.
- Pigs grow very quickly, and you can see a difference within days. So we would shoot with one piglet for a couple of days, and then have to get a replacement.
- 'Aviri' is only a metaphoric title, but steam as a physical component has a very important role to play in the film.
- Horror films can be of different kinds. But 'Aaviri' is not a horror film. It's a thriller against the backdrop of a family.
- Handling the digital avatar of a piglet was challenging, the actors had their task cut out while imagining a live creature on sets. It took them some time to get into the groove, but the journey was worth it.
- 'Babe' takes place on a small farm and is all about the piglet's interaction with the animals around it. 'Adhugo' is more about the piglet and its interactions with humans.
- Not only with regard to the VFX process, but in many ways, 'Adhugo' has helped me experience new things.
- Only on the last day of the shoot Bhumika Chawla revealed that she was pregnant. None of us had a clue about it and I was shocked to say the least. She is a thorough professional and just carried on with her job with no fuss whatsoever. Hat's off to her.
- I have worked on several horror films but haven't experienced any such thing, that could also be because I don't believe in ghosts.
- As far as the 'Adhugo' sequel is concerned, I would love to do it.
- There is a certain amount of freshness and credibility that new actors bring to any movie.
- Neither me nor Suresh Babu hurry up to release our films.
- I don't think just because I work with big actors, I will become a big director. So I work with only actors who do justice for my roles.
- At times, I thought of leaving filmmaking because of the pressure and frustration 'Adhugo' had put on me.
- Bunty is a piglet that comes up with a lot of funny antics. Dancing is among its strengths and I'm glad people are liking the music video where it grooves to popular Telugu songs. I have made the character very likeable.
- I don't want things to be done in a hurry. So I never keep pressure on music directors with deadlines. I ask them to take their own time.
- I shot 'Nuvvilla' for 56 days and stayed at Sitara Hotel in Ramoji Film City.
- To me, success means either the audience have to like your movie or the critics have to.
- I found an old dilapidated house in Banjara Hills which the owners were demolishing, and requested them to give it to me for filming, which they obliged. We worked nearly four months on that building to make it look the way we wanted.
- Because it's not always possible to shoot with a live piglet, I had to create a piglet. I went abroad and enquired about the parts, which cost almost as much as a big actor's remuneration. I decided to go for an animatronics piglet, which is a new technology.
- Film production is not rocket science. It's about organizing resources and pooling in funds.
- I think I have a karmic connection with animals. They add so much value to my life and I feel comfortable with them over humans.
- It's very expensive to maintain pure breed pigs. But I am an animal lover, so it wasn't a problem for me.
- One day, after shooting, when I went back to my hotel room to relax, I just couldn't sleep. I had a feeling that someone was in my room. I was scared and opened all my windows and doors, but the feeling only got worse. I decided to leave the room immediately.
- 'Avunu' is a thriller, suspense film set within a small family with a good mix of scary and funny moments, but not a horror film.
- I never consider whether an actor is small or big. Working with small or big actors doesn't excite me.
- I thought of making a film with an animal. But many movies have already come with the same idea. On the other hand, what I have observed is, when children watch cartoon shows, they usually get excited with the presence of pigs or piglets in those shows.
