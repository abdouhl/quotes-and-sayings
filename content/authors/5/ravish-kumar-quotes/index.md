- Watching people getting absorbed in news, I have learned that if the media wants, it can empower citizens with its brave questions. It can make India's democracy more alive.

- The lifespan of faith and culture is much more than the ones who play politics in its name.

- Definitely there has been a decline in journalism. It wasn't there at all when you fought an election, won, lost and came back to become an editor. That must have been the golden age of journalism.

- The media understands the system only on the basis of ministers and governments. It seldom sympathises with the people who work within that system.
