quotes = ['''I think that kids are a wonderful, wonderful reader to have in your head.''' ,'''I am hoping to work with writers publishing books for first time, since I of course remember what that experience is like. It's all a bit of a mystery for new authors who don't know what to expect.''' ,'''I think that's one of the most important things that books do: not to teach you anything, but to help you teach yourself by just being in the world of the book and having your own thoughts and reactions and noticing your own reactions and thoughts and learning about yourself that way.''' ,'''Every published writer suffers through that first draft because most of the time, that's a disappointment.''' ,'''I felt vulnerable and very much between friends. I remember walking down the hallway and thinking I had no way of knowing what was coming, literally. This wasn't because I had some horrific bullying story, but because of a steady drip of negativity.''' ,'''I think we must all feel that there are people out there who know things about our young selves, you know, our early, early lives, that no one else can ever know.''' ,''''Middle school' is used as shorthand for a time when things change. It's a time a lot of kids feel like they don't even have one good friend.''' ,'''The wonderful thing about writing fiction is that no one is stopping you. There's no one saying, 'You can't do that.'''' ,'''There was a boy in my building who was my best friend when I was growing up. There was also a mysterious person on my corner who we called the Laughing Man.''' ,'''In so many ways, being a literary agent is an irresistible job to me. Not only does it involve all the things I love - being an advocate for others, problem solving, and going to meetings - yes, that's true, I love meetings, though everyone says it's bizarre! - but most importantly, I love working with people whose writing excites me.''' ,'''I've met seven homeschooling families through many, many extracurricular activities such as fencing. I don't have a point of view of homeschooling. For some families, homeschooling works.''' ,'''I grew up mostly an only child. My dad remarried when I was a teenager. And then I had two stepbrothers. And then my dad had a second child. So I have a brother from the time I was 15. But I really grew up feeling like an only child.''' ,'''My kids really like food, and they like to cook, so it's a lot of fun to shop with them.''' ,'''I like the idea of a world, even within a big giant city, where you're not anonymous. You have an identity, and that's an identity that's known just sort of by shopkeepers. I felt that as a kid, and I loved it.''' ,'''I'm always thinking about identity. And the middle-school years are a time of exploring questions about who you are and who you want to be. For the first time, you see the world in a broader sense.''' ,'''I personally find the ideas that girls need to cover their shoulders in school a little bit strange... when we're telling girls, you know, 'You have to cover your shoulders because otherwise you're a distraction to other people in your class,' probably something is wrong.''' ,'''I never had a favourite book! I liked all kinds of things - science fiction, so I read Heinlen and Ray Bradbury, and I also liked reading about kids like myself, so I read Judy Blume and Norma Klein and Paula Danzinger and a lot of other writers. I also read James Herriot!''' ,'''There's this trouble with books for me because I'm terrible at thinking of titles. The truth is, even with the titles that I've landed on in the end, they always feel wrong. I think it's because of this whole problem of having to package your book in a certain way.''' ,'''My books tend to have a lot of questions in them, and they tend to avoid black and white, for lack of a better metaphor.''' ,'''During the week,I'm really focused on writing and output. Sunday is a day when I really try not to write at all.''' ,'''A lot of my ideas for books come from newspaper articles. But I don't like to be actively looking for ideas.''' ,'''Probably because I really love this bookmaking and storytelling world, I'd been thinking for years about the possibility of becoming a literary agent.''' ,'''As a reader, I much prefer to read a book where people embody all kinds of ideas and everybody is making mistakes.''' ,'''I read a whole lot as a child, and, of course, I still read children's books.''' ,'''I would never look a gift horse in the mouth. I've had some lovely homemade earrings and, recently, a wall hanging made in the style of Georges Seurat.''' ,'''I asked myself what it was that I wanted from writing and where my connection with books began, and the answer to that question was definitely in childhood, because that's where my connection with reading began.''' ,'''I loved reading all kinds of books, but I particularly loved books like 'Red Planet' by Robert Heinlein, which very few people read anymore but is a wonderful science fiction story.''' ,'''I think things hit me very hard, and I wish I had allowed things to roll off my back a little bit more.''' ,'''I think of 'Liar & Spy' as completely different and actually not at all like a 'When You Reach Me'-type story. I feel like 'Liar & Spy' has a much quieter, more emotional revelation.''' ,'''I like to write about questions that interest me, not the conclusions I've come to.''' ,'''We're allowed as adults to create a life that we like. Kids don't have that freedom.''' ,'''I think that my first book - I was trying to write the kind of book I would have loved as a kid. So it's sort of, like, a book inspired by my childhood reading and the passion that I felt about reading when I was a kid.''' ,'''I have nothing like a writing routine. I sometimes have trouble buckling down to write at home.''' ,'''I am basically in awe of every family's ability to make decisions for their kids.''' ,'''I try to write about internal experience versus the external self. I like to present ideas, but not package them neatly.''' ,'''I try to remember what it was like to be a kid in New York. I lived in different parts of my childhood in Manhattan on the Upper West Side, where 'When You Reach Me' is set, and also in the Midwood section of Brooklyn.''' ,'''Anyone who's familiar with my writing schedule knows that there is always plenty of time between books for me!''' ,'''From age nine, my friends and I were on the streets, walking home, going to each other's houses, going to the store. I really wanted to write about that: the independence that's a little bit scary but also a really positive thing in a lot of ways.''' ,'''Try really, really hard not to judge your own work too harshly.''' ,'''On Sunday, I think the most important thing for me is to just turn my brain off. The idea of not trying is the key, because that's where you're relaxed enough to let your brain make new connections.''' ,'''Mostly what I try to do is build emotion. Only I'd prefer not to do it by telling you about emotion but by pushing that emotion down.''' ,'''I do try to write in ways that reflect reality, and I think that reality is rarely simple.''' ,]
