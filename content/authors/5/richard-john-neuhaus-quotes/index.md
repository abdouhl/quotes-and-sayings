quotes = ['''Socialism is the religion people get when they lose their religion.''' ,'''Religion as a human phenomenon is as riddled through with potential for both good and evil as any other phenomenon.''' ,'''My eyes are wide open to the conflicts within the Church, but I don't think you can call it schism.''' ,'''If a church offers no truth that is not available in the general culture - in, for instance, the editorials of the New York Times or, for that matter, of National Review - there is not much reason to pay it attention.''' ,'''My hope that the Church will emerge as a strong leader in society is just that a hope. What I described in The Catholic Moment is not a prophecy but the outline of a possibility. There are no guarantees that my hopes expressed in The Catholic Moment will ever be realised.''' ,'''In the gay (Catholic) community, it would seem, the maxim is: love the sin and love the sinner, but hate anyone who calls it a sin or him a sinner.''' ,]
