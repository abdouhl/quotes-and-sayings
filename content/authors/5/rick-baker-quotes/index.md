- I do fat people and these makeups are really hard to do, but I want to make monster movies.

- It's fun doing new things.
- When you're working on a movie you always hope that people will go for it and enjoy what you're doing.
- When my parents died, it became clear to me that there was an end in sight. Death was never a real thing to me. And then when that happened I realized I only have so many years left, if I'm lucky.
- I used to have to save my allowances to buy a quart of rubber to make a mask, and it's how I spent all my free time.
- Usually people who are in my position, they run a company and they hire people and then they take the credit for it.
- When I do a mask, I do try to put a lot of character and a lot of expression into the sculpt.
- Sometimes we think of a creature like a person in a suit, but then you have limitations of two eyes and two legs - they have to see and breathe. I got more into puppetry because it offered more possibilities.
- I can't tell you how many people would say to me as a teenager, 'Why don't you grow up and start thinking about getting a real job?'
