He listened, looking at me with that serious and penetrating gaze of his that caused me such trepidation, and asked whether I knew what I wanted to do.''' ,'''Above all, don't fear difficult moments. The best comes from them.''' ,'''A child from the age of 2 or 3 absorbs what is in the environment and what generates hatred for anyone perceived to be different.''' ,'''It is imperfection - not perfection - that is the end result of the program written into that formidably complex engine that is the human brain, and of the influences exerted upon us by the environment and whoever takes care of us during the long years of our physical, psychological and intellectual development.''' ,'''I should thank Mussolini for having declared me to be of an inferior race.
