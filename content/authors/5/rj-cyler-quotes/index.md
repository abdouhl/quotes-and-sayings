- In life, my childish behavior is the good kind, not to where it's annoying and, 'Wow, someone sit him down and give him a bottle, give him a Pamper.' It's like, 'This situation is very heavy, but RJ is here, so he'll lighten things up a little.'
- I was definitely Theater-Band Geek/Straight-Up Boss Subgroup C. I was really into band and theater and super into music at the time. I loved performing arts, and that would definitely be my group.
- I feel like 'Power Rangers' as just a franchise and as a message in itself is taking down the barrier of putting a certain look to a certain thing, right?
- You know how in most teenage movies the girl meets the boy, they kiss, they have some type of fallout, then there's an awkward sex scene, and then they're together forever? And they say the perfect things the whole way? That doesn't happen in real life.
- Calamari isn't too bad. That's what I thought cuttlefish was gonna be that. I've eaten octopus and eel and shark and sea urchin before, and - and those are good.

- Some movies are entirely too heavy, and some movies have no meat in them.

- Most people I talked to, they'd be like, your first is your worst, because you go on and everybody's probably done more than you, so you get that sense that they're on a whole different level. But they just made me feel like a piece of the family.
- I'm not really good with explaining myself verbally, but I do it through music and other outlets.
- I love challenges. And that's just in life.
- This acting is going to leave my stain. Not just my mark, because you can wipe a mark off. But a stain: it's going to take a whole lot to get that out, and that's how I'm going to leave my stain on this world.
- In my mind, creativity is consciousness.
- You fight the most with your brother. The first fight you're going to get into is with your brother. The first fight you lose is going to be with your brother. But nobody else better try to fight your brother. Only you can fight your brother without it being a problem.
- I'm not an emotional person. I don't use the emotion train that much. I just use the happy card.
- Without creativity, I'd be just 'blah blah blah.'
- We didn't have everything we wanted when we were younger, but there was never a moment we didn't feel our parents weren't doing everything they could.
- Acting-wise, I'm way more comfortable finding out new things about the actor in me and RJ as a person. There's a lot of new nuggets that I can dip in the sauce.
- I love The Isley Brothers.
