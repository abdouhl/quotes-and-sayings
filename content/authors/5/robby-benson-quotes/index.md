- I started playing guitar when I was 6 or 7 years old, and I think that, within a week of getting my first guitar, I started writing music. I just love it.
- I've learned to sell my music, I've learned to direct, I've written screenplays... All of this fulfilled my artistic needs but also put food on the table.
- Music runs through everything I do - I even think musically; even when I was acting, but, especially, when I am directing. Directing is very musical.
