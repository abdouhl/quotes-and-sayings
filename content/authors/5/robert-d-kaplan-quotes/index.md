It is from the disparity that we are going to get all the political upheaval for the next few years.''' ,'''If you look at the history of the U.S., we were an empire long before we were a nation.''' ,'''A lot of the changes are so gradual that they don't even qualify as news, or even as interesting: they're so mundane that we just take them for granted. But history shows that it's the mundane changes that are more important than the dramatic 'newsworthy' events.''' ,'''We talk a lot about individual rights, but in fact Americans are very willing to give up our individual rights if it means our property values will be protected, and so on.''' ,'''If you travel around America you see different sections of highways donated by this or that person, and that's a slow beginning of what may end up being a situation common in the Third World: some sections of highways in wealthy areas are beautifully maintained and other parts are just dirt-strewn potholes.''' ,'''The United States is not overdeployed or overextended with deployments in 150 countries on any given year. On any given week we have about 65 deployments.''' ,'''The Cold War went on for so long that it bred a kind of worldwide military establishment. Even when budgets went down in the early and mid-nineties, it didn't really affect it.''' ,]
