- I'm always going to have to prove myself. That's the way my life has been, my career has been, and I'm OK with it. I've come to terms with it.
- When I first got into wrestling, guys my size weren't really being signed to WWE like they are today. But deep down, I knew if I worked as hard as I possibly could, it would eventually happen. Timing is everything, that's for sure.
- I was going to go back to doing the indies more often and possibly working more of a full-time schedule in Japan. If I didn't get the chance to go to WWE, that would have been a bummer to me, but I was just going to continue to do the best I could and continue my legacy.
- I like to say that at some point, you'll say in the history of wrestling there's nobody better than The Undisputed ERA. We're going to do exactly what we said we're going to do, and that's become champions.
- My father is the reason I'm a wrestler today. He was trained by Jim 'The Anvil' Neidhart, and competed under the names Billy the Kid and Elvis Wesley on the Florida Independent scene.
- People know what to expect from me. When it comes to Roderick Strong, you're going to get everything that I have in my being, and there will be fights that will be like no other fights of the night.
- Like a lot of the guys that I looked up to in the business, I wanted to travel the world and establish myself.
- I thought my time in TNA went about as well as it possibly could for what it was. With me being as young as I was and them trying to highlight the x division like they did.
- I've said it continuously in NXT: There is no one who can outwork me.
- I'm always the kid that lived in the trailer park in my mind. So I'm always constantly proving to myself that I'm better than that and that I will never go back to that.
- As a competitor, I always have to test myself on the biggest stages and against the best there is to offer.
- The one thing that I heard is that being dependable is priceless, and that's something I really put focus on.
- I wrestled in Miami quite a few times. I was doing shows there before I really got my break, before going to the Northeast quite a bit.
- When you commit yourself to do the things I do, day in and day out, you firmly believe that opportunity will present itself.
- I don't see myself going into the tag team division.
- I've had to do some soul-searching at times. I reflect a lot, not on where I have been but where I want to go and how to get there.
- I've always prided myself in being someone a company can count on.
- I'm always prepared. I've wrestled every kind of wrestler that there is, I've been in every situation that there possibly has been.
- Once you start hearing a buzz about somebody, you want to check them out because you never know if, and, or when exactly, they may come to NXT because NXT obviously has the best talent in the world.
- Austin Theory's young, super-talented and thinks he's the cat's meow. But I'm just going to punish him. It's going to be pretty funny to see his eyes after the first few minutes when he realizes that there's nowhere to run.
- The more I do it, the better I become, and that makes me a very dangerous man to the wrestling world.
- I was with Ring of Honor for 13 years, and going to NXT and WWE was such a different environment.
- I believe my past setbacks are part of what it takes to build a champion. After all, how can you fully appreciate winning without knowing what it's like to lose?
- I had been wrestling all over the world for 15 years, and I had been a mainstay in Ring of Honor for almost 13 years.
- I've been around wrestling since I was 12 years old and I really believe I was put on this planet to wrestle and that's what I love to do.
