quotes = ['''I don't have much faith... in the government police.''' ,'''I'm motivated by the positive ways in which Bitcoin use being widespread will make the world a better place.''' ,'''Voluntaryism is the idea that all human interactions should be free of coercion, based on individual self-ownership. This is in contrast to socialism, which is based on coercion justified by collective ownership.''' ,'''The beauty of the free market is that everyone gets what they want. With governmentally imposed systems, it is always one size fits all.''' ,'''Bitcoin will experience many bubbles along its way to improving the lives of everyone on the planet. I'm not concerned with the short-term price fluctuations.''' ,'''PayPal came within an inch of being shut down by regulators when they started. The feds seizing the Dwolla account and stealing the money that is owned by Mt. Gox customers is more proof that Bitcoin is the superior payment system.''' ,'''St. Kitts' government is much more libertarian compared with the U.S. It's not even close.''' ,'''Because the supply of Bitcoin is limited, the price of Bitcoin is going to have to increase and increase very substantially over time. My advice is that if you're interested in Bitcoin and excited by Bitcoin, then buy some Bitcoin and hold onto them, and you're likely to do very well over time.''' ,'''Monero at a protocol level is very, very private and has that big advantage over bitcoin.''' ,'''Somehow I wound up with the nickname 'Bitcoin Jesus,' so people expect me to know about everything everywhere.''' ,'''If there's another iPhone that's better, that's sad for my old iPhone. But it means we get to use a better one.''' ,'''If bitcoin is more expensive or slower than traditional financial systems, people aren't going to use it.''' ,'''Price is the least interesting thing about bitcoin.''' ,'''Silicon Valley is a great place for Bitcoin, since everyone understands computers, and there are lots of libertarians running around.''' ,'''Bernie Madoff... was regulated up and down and every which way, and it didn't do any good - he ran away with everyone's money.''' ,'''Setting regulatory certainty is very important for bitcoin. I'm opposed to the regulations, but the bitcoin businesses need to know the rules of the game in order to move ahead.''' ,'''Bitcoin is amazingly transformative because it's the first time in the entire history of the world in which anybody can now send or receive any amount of money, with anyone else, anywhere on the planet, without having to ask permission from any bank or government.''' ,'''If the world's using bitcoin, governments won't be able to fund wars through inflation like they do today.''' ,'''I don't think it matters at all if the Bitcoin Foundation were to close.''' ,'''I don't think Bitcoin cares what the Chinese or American politicians do.''' ,'''If the U.S. government tries to restrict or clamp down, that just means there will be many more bitcoin businesses in Hong Kong and Singapore, and all those Americans will miss out on all the opportunities.''' ,'''You have to be really, really careful how you use bitcoin in order to use it privately.''' ,'''I do think that overall blockchains are likely to be a much more powerful force for good than evil.''' ,'''Bitcoin never sleeps. We need to move quickly and grow quickly and do everything sooner rather than later.''' ,'''I like to call myself a voluntaryist. That means that I think that all human interaction should be on a voluntary basis. And that nobody should be able to use force or fraud in any human interaction whatsoever.''' ,'''Bitcoin is here to stay.''' ,'''Bitcoin is coming from a bunch of young computer nerds who saw this thing and thought it was neat. A lot of the early bitcoiners are 19-year-old kids, still living at home with their parents, and they don't have any business experience.''' ,'''Once people see Bitcoin and how it works, they realise this isn't just a flash in the pan.''' ,'''The most objective measurement we have is that the market actually valued the two split Ethereums more than it valued the one original Ethereum; the market viewed it as a good thing, and I don't see it as any sort of disaster whatsoever.''' ,'''If it is something particularly useful and for some reason is having trouble getting funding from traditional sources, I may be interested.''' ,'''I don't think it's any sort of stretch of the imagination to say that, very, very realistically, each single bitcoin, if bitcoin becomes popular, will have to be worth at least tens of thousands of dollars.''' ,'''Before Bitcoin, I was just waiting around for the Singularity.''' ,'''At first, almost everyone who got involved did so for philosophical reasons. We saw bitcoin as a great idea, as a way to separate money from the state.''' ,'''We will never hear about people's Bitcoin accounts being frozen or seized by a government agency.''' ,'''Gox is the worst-run business in the history of the world.''' ,'''The U.S. is making it extremely difficult for me to stop being American.''' ,'''I think most politicians have almost no understanding of economics; otherwise, they wouldn't have become politicians.''' ,'''If you look at the market cap of Ethereum before the hard fork and the split into Ethereum Classic, the combined market cap of Ethereum and Ethereum Classic is greater than the market cap before the split - and everybody got what they want.''' ,'''People own their own bodies and have the absolute right to put anything they want into it.''' ,'''I consider the guys at Mt. Gox my friends.''' ,'''I think examples of free market transactions between peaceful people using Bitcoin and the Internet, I think it's a wonderful thing. It's going to make the world a better place.''' ,'''Anybody who has enough information about what's going on in the bitcoin world, you would not buy your bitcoins on Mt. Gox.''' ,'''I am tired of seeing real criminals, with lots of victims being ignored, while traditional law enforcement is busy going after perpetrators of victimless crimes such as those involved in the Silk Road Marketplace.''' ,'''Money laundering is not a crime. It's just because certain men with guns don't like what other people are doing with their own money, so they decide it's okay to lock those people in a cage.''' ,]
