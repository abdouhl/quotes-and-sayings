By and large the network has been understanding, but then so have I.''' ,'''People also don't care about the daily comings and goings of diplomats and yet we must report it.''' ,'''I don't expect to win every battle but I think Fred Pierce has enough respect for me that I can go fight my battles and win my share.''' ,'''I don't think people realize the extent to which TV networks are hurt when they carry public broadcasting.

The question is, do you want to attract people who don't watch network news or fight over the people who do?''' ,'''I respect the game that goes on of putting this against that, but I don't respect, nor do I enjoy, an awful lot of the actual programs that go on the air.''' ,'''I'm sensitive about my image of being hard to reach.''' ,'''In the past ABC has made half-hearted efforts or, worse, cosmetic efforts, to do something about news and I wasn't certain about what their real aim was - nor am I now.''' ,'''In fact, I had a series of offers which would have brought me a lot of money to make films and package TV programs.
