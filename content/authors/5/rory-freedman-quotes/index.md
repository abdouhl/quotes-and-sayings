- You write a book, it's out for however many years, and with the passing of time, you're not the same person. I'm not the same person I was when I wrote those books; I'm not even the same person I was when I started writing 'Beg.' I had many shifts spiritually, and one of them was in the use of language.
- Compassion and mercy are important, period. It doesn't matter who's at our receiving end, but we need to be flexing those muscles. It's not mutually exclusive: If you have compassion for children starving in Africa, it doesn't mean you can't have compassion for adults in Africa or animals that are being tortured and abused.
- The Rice Dream rice milk is like a savior in my life, and I couldn't live without it. The Earth Balance soy butter is so good you could eat it with a spoon.
- A favorite cooking method? I'm a fan of all of them! Anything that gets a pile of random ingredients into a cruelty-free dish works for me!
- Parma is an amazing Parmesan cheese substitute made from walnuts. It tastes like a dream and is healthy, to boot!
- If people learned what they were contributing to every time they ate meat, eggs, or dairy, surely they would be just as motivated as I was to change.
- There's no reason that we need to be counting things and adding things up in order to sit down and eat a meal. I enjoy eating so much; I don't want to do match every time I eat. I guarantee you, maybe your diet soda has no calories, but it's still poison. We have to think about what are we putting in our mouths.
- I love animals; I've always loved animals. It's how I identified myself for so long, but I didn't know that in so many ways, I was living my life not in alignment with that. And once I learned about those ways I could be loving animals better, I made those changes, which made me happier and had me living a life that had me contributing.
- Don't crop ears or tails or declaw cats; it's really painful. People think it's necessary, but it's painful for the animal, and it's completely unnecessary.
- Speaking the truth gets a little easier each time you do it.
- So many people romanticize writing. And I get it. But I never once wanted to be a writer.
- I've been seeing more and more Gardein soy chicken and soy beef products lately, and they're pretty darn good.
- Sometimes it's hard to tell where your instincts start and your baggage stops.
- Traveling is magical, inspiring, and life - changing.
- I'm afraid love may not exist the way I want it to.
- My whole life growing up, both my parents told me not to swear like a sailor. After college, I recall there was finally a time where I swore, and neither one of them was correcting me, and I felt so relieved. I thought, finally; I can finally be myself and not get yelled at.
- I hate writing. There are a million other things I'd rather be doing. I write because I have to. Because if I feel so strongly about what is happening to animals, and I don't do anything to help them, who will?
