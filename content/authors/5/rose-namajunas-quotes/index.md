- When I force things, it just doesn't go well.
- My dad died, and he wasn't in my life because he had schizophrenia, so it's been something that my entire family has been fighting against since I can remember.
- My hands look like my dad's and my mom's put together. She's a piano player, he was an artist, and I use the creative qualities I got from them in my fighting. But I don't just destroy with my hands; I also create: I cook and make art and garden.

- I definitely get down on myself. I needed to work on my self-talk. The same way you do footwork drills and cardio training, I had to do self-talk training.

- My dream is to be a farmer myself, but also to provide opportunities to others who don't have the land or the resources, in order to grow food themselves and teach them how to do it.
- I guess I'm crazy. If everything was easy-peasy and green lights all the time, it'd be kind of boring.
- When I'm totally in tune with myself, and I'm flowing, it don't matter who I'm fighting; that's just a problem for anybody.

- Martial arts is about honor and respect.

- I think that I can speak in front of the camera. I think my fighting ability can speak for itself as well.
- Being resourceful and creating is a big part of my Lithuanian culture. My grandfather is part of who I am, too. He was a professional wrestler. He had a very functional, very slick, long frame.
- All my jabs, they're all different. I have a million different jabs.
- I learned that love is a much more sustainable energy to draw on than hate.
- Fighting causes you to face life head on, because you could end up seriously getting hurt, and you could hurt somebody else. It causes both people to face the reality that we are fragile beings, but it doesn't mean we can't enjoy ourselves in the process and punch each other in the face and have a good time.
- I think we have a great opportunity as fighters and athletes to be good role models. I'm by no means perfect, but I think we can try.

- Everybody's one fight away from getting a title shot if they step in on short notice for somebody.

- When you want to be a fighter, you have to give it everything you got. MMA just became who I am because of the amount of work I was putting into my training. It all starts in the gym.

- It's pretty cool to be called a champion.
- Mixed martial arts - there's just been a lot of trash talking and things like that. People, I feel like, aren't really being true to themselves or being honest. I don't know, maybe that's what they feel they need to do to entertain things.

- All I can control is myself and just keep having a positive attitude.
- I respect my competition.
- We need the villain sometimes. It makes for an interesting story.
- Me being the best in the world, it doesn't mean that much to me if I'm not a good person at the end of the day, if I'm not setting a good example for other people to be better to each other.

- All I can do is make sure I show up to fight, and then they have no choice but to pay me.
- I'm more dramatic than other people are, or I just show it more. I don't think there's anything wrong with that. I have a lot of passion.

- All the scars on my body, all the bumps and bruises, all the muscles - that is a story of everything I have done. And it's not just my story. My ancestors who came before me gave me this vessel to sculpt and mold.
- There are so many variables that go into a fight, you shouldn't waste your time worrying about the other fighters.
- I'm sick of all the hate and anger and stuff like that going on.
- People think after the fight you get to sit around and relax and all that. But really, people come around and family and all that, so it's a whole 'nother responsibility you have to take care of.
- A lot of times, my best friend was my dog.
- There's a process to everything. If you fast track or make shortcuts in any way, and you get too much of one thing, you're just out of balance.

- I'm successful every day because I look in the mirror, and I'm happy with who I am.
