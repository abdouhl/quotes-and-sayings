- Part of the delight of my garden is that you just get lost in it before you've even started to do anything.
- I started reading seriously after I was in college. I read comic books. I read every 'Power Man' and 'Iron Fist' that ever came out. I had a teacher introduce me to poetry, and that kind of woke me up.
- The madness of spring is so enticing. I love it when things are opening up and emerging from the ground. I also love the middle of summer when fruit is bursting forth, but I even love the garden in the winter when everything is resting.
- 'Beloved' by Toni Morrison. I think I read it first in college and have read it every few years since. The language itself is remarkable. I don't know that I've read a book that explains America so well.
- I have my own orchard, and I also work with the Bloomington Community Orchard, which has been one of the best experiences of my life.
- 'Beloved' is a book that makes me cry.
- There's something about beautiful moments in sports that alters our experience of time. And I'd say the same thing about poetry and gardening. Gardening slows me down. I want to stop and observe everything.
- I walk out to my backyard garden at certain times of the year, and I can't get 30 feet without stopping for 20 minutes because the goumis need trimming.
- I think it's crucial that we remember the lives of people, not their deaths. Our deaths are not our lives.
