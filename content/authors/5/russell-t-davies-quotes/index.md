quotes = ['''It's tough and it should be tough - it should never be easy to be given millions of pounds to make a drama. The coalition government is doing terrible things to the BBC, but drama will survive even if we end up putting on a play in a backroom of a pub.''' ,'''I love having debates with people when they are debates but some people, you just can't. Some people shouldn't be given the oxygen.''' ,'''The marvelous thing about 'Doctor Who' is that it tells stories that no one else can tell.''' ,'''I hate the idea that I have to represent any particular section of society; I just write good telly, that's all.''' ,'''Drama's not safe and it's not pretty and it's not kind. People expect the basic template of television drama where there might be naughty villains, but everyone ends up having a nice cup of tea. You've got to do big moral choices and show the terrible things people do in terrible situations. Drama is failing if it doesn't do that.''' ,]
