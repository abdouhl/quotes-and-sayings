- I would actually like to play Bobby Brown. To me, he was just the King of R&B at one point.
- Working with Angela Bassett is by far the best. I've watched and admired her for years. I'm very intrigued by her work. She's so cool. I still call her 'Mom' when I see her.
- It's an honor to be a part of Magic Shave as their new ambassador. One of the problems that some African-American men have with shaving is razor bumps. Magic Shave is perfect because once you eliminate the razor, you eliminate the bumps, and it's so easy to use.
- I met Tyler Perry and we did 'House of Payne' and a movie. We've done a couple other films since then, but it all boils down to the work. I'm a work-a-holic, which is why I think that I've been successful. If you tell me no, I'll work even harder!

- It's shown and proved that hard work pays off. Make goals, achieve them and replace them with new goals.

- It's rare that I turn down a photo or autograph, because these are the people that support me, so why not support them. I love it and I invite it. I love what I do and the whole 'celebrity' life and all that.
- I was actually picked on as a kid. I guess in high school it started to change for me. I guess being picked on made a lasting impression on me so I never - whenever somebody calls me handsome or anything like that, I never take it for granted. I appreciate it every time I hear it, so it's never something that gets old.
- I put on whatever is comfortable on me. Suit, jeans and tee as long as it's comfortable. It doesn't matter what brand. If it looks good I buy it.
- If I had my way, the woman I marry, she wouldn't be a part of Twitter and she wouldn't be on Facebook.
- I really started dreaming... and broke out of my shyness when I got to Howard University. My first acting class was an Intro to Acting class with Professor Bay, who really broke me out of my shell, encouraged me to follow my dreams and make them a reality.
- My parents always taught me never to take anything for granted because it can be taken away from you like that, especially when it comes to looks. I could get into a car crash tomorrow and disfigure my face. So I have to stay grounded.
- For every person that doesn't like you, there's gonna be somebody who does.
- I just do what's comfortable for me, whether it's getting fresh haircuts, or the clothes that I wear. It's simple; I'm just me. I don't really go out of my way. I do make sure my face is washed and moisturized, though.
- I'd rate myself an 8. I do have my flaws, but I'm a cool dude. If I wasn't myself, I'd kick it with me. I'm a down-to-earth person and all around cool guy.

- If you got a dope girl, there's going to be people that want her. But I don't know, I've always kept my 'A-game' on point. I just make a point to make sure the woman that I'm with is taken care of. You got to keep it new, so I go out of my way to make them feel special.
- I got in a really bad accident in a Toyota vehicle, but I feel like the safety of the vehicle and God really saved my life.
