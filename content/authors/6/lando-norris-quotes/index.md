- I just get annoyed at myself. A lot of swearing goes on generally when I am driving.
- When I was five - it's not even bad - I stole a sweet from the sweet shop.
- If I make a mistake and finish 10th when we should have finished ninth, then I will be unhappy.
- Getting in and out of the car with the halo takes a bit of experience. I struggled initially, but after a few trial runs I was fine.
- The McLaren prizes can only help me in my quest to ultimately reach Formula One.
- It's what counts, isn't it, on the Sunday, rather than pre-season testing. If you lock up, you do a little mistake, it's nothing, but if you do it on Sunday, you lose a place or you have to box for a flat spot or something like that. It's a much bigger problem.
- I am sure as everyone knows that I am not the happiest if I don't do a good job in qualifying or the race.
- The racing is quite boring, sometimes. It's hard to see how it pulls in fans.
- The 'Pro-Sim' is pretty much the best simulator you can buy, because of the steering motor and the pedals. The force feedback we get through the steering is pretty much exactly the same as what we get in the actual car in terms of how heavy it is.
- In testing, you make a mistake, you just say 'OK we'll have another go' instead of it being the only chance you get.
- I want to go down in the history books with what I've achieved.
- On the RFactor model that comes with the 'Pro-Sim,' everything is balanced and measured. If you go up on the rear ride height, for example, it changes the airflow and the downforce of the car. You learn by trying different things, which gives you a better idea when you're on a race weekend.
- I guess for every driver the aim is to beat their teammate.
- I like to paint my own helmets. I design my own suit and boots, I like being unique in that way.
- I don't like going to the gym. My biggest focus is the neck and endurance. I wear this 'Fifty Shades of Grey' harness, with a resistance trainer pulling against it.
- I'm loving my role as a McLaren Young Driver, spending time in the simulator at the McLaren Technology Centre and attending some Grands Prix with the team.
- On the sim at home, you can change downforce levels, roll bars, springs, ride heights - you can try all these different things.
- I left school to concentrate on racing. It was a family decision between my mum, dad and myself.
- How you go about testing is just very different to just being in the situation of qualifying, having to go out, having to nail the lap.
- I'm a fighter, I'm a winner, and I'm not interested in just battling my team-mate for the back of the grid.
- The Pirellis you can push for a couple of laps and then you've got to start saving. It's not easy.
- In karting, you turn up and drive, look at the data and go home. But I like doing more, learning about the engines and how to make them go even better.
- Joining McLaren didn't add a lot of pressure but of course you want to make sure you can impress them.
- The first time I used a simulator was in 2014 when I was competing in the Ginetta Junior Championship.
- F2's much harder physically on the arms and almost on the whole body than F1 is.
- Sometimes I'm a bit under-aggressive and sometimes a bit over. But I think it's good to have both.
- If I want to do well in racing I need to be more focused so I stopped going to school. If I wasn't a very good driver it would not be a wise decision, but it gives me an advantage over my competitors.
- I think the F2 tyres are probably one of the hardest things to adapt to, harder than the Formula One Pirellis were to get used to.
- I started off with sim driving, playing 'Gran Turismo,' and my Dad had some sort of Logitech steering wheel with pedals for the PlayStation 2.
- F2 cars have downforce; they're quick. But it's difficult for your brain and eyes to keep up with everything that's going on once you're in an F1 car. You get used to it and you learn to stay calm, because if you react too quickly the opposite will happen. Being more relaxed is when it becomes more natural and controlled.
- I will be unhappy if I know I have not accomplished something I should have done that was possible.
- My favourite car I drove in the 'shoot out' at Silverstone was the 2016 Mercedes DTM car. I loved every moment in it, the downforce being particularly surprising.
- There are going to be things I'm not going to be great at, times when I make mistakes, 100%.
- There's so many bits on a car these days it's hard to know where everything is. You have a bit of an idea but if you are behind someone and you suddenly change direction it's hard to know exactly where the car is.
- I've been away since I was pretty much eight, traveling to the car tracks, and then going to Europe and traveling more.
- No driver is perfect.
- I want to be part of that long list who have achieved great things with McLaren, won races and championships.
- I did suffer a lot since karting, with my size and everything, not really having a clue what to do when I started karting. So I suffered in every category: F4, F3, F2. Not so much F2 but I've had to kind of play catch-up quite a bit and in some ways, F1 was a bit nicer with power steering.
- I had to drive with a roof in LMP2, and I managed to get used to that quite quickly - although it's still not a Halo, it's still different to what I'm used to.
- It's not like I'm nervous of people seeing what I can or can't do on camera or on TV or anything, or what my engineers think.
- McLaren were one of the first teams I liked and supported.
- Every time I get in the McLaren I feel more comfortable, my confidence increases and I feel more at home with the team.
- I turned away from bikes when I got a bambino kart for my seventh birthday and started doing some karting, just around some cones at home, but I didn't think at that point I knew I wanted to go into F1, it was more just for fun.
- I don't drink at all.
- I think Weetabix and full-fat milk is what it is all about.
- I focus on my own job.
- I'm definitely more one of the drivers who would want to do Daytona, Le Mans, and the Indy 500.
- I probably work harder, putting in a lot of time and effort, than a lot of drivers because all I think about, and all I do, is to do with racing, trying to make myself a better driver.
- I started off riding motorbikes and at that point my hero was Valentino Rossi.
- For my career, I wouldn't go racing if I didn't enjoy it. I still need to have my say, and not just get put with a team and get told to deal with it.
- I think beating myself up sometimes and knowing I am not happy when I do it makes me work harder to do a good job.
- Rule number one is: Beat your team-mate.
- I know a lot of people say they always believed they could get into F1, but I didn't quite believe that, certainly not when I was 7 and maybe not until I was 14. It was always so far away.
- I'm sure like everyone else I'm not always the happiest if I don't do a good job in quali or the race or whatever, so I think beating myself up sometimes makes me work harder.
- A team like McLaren doesn't want to keep changing drivers at a time when they're developing the car. They want consistency.
- I kind of look up to Lewis, not as a hero, but as a very good driver who is very fast. Everyone has to admire his pace, especially in qualifying. He is a driver I support, in terms of him being British, and I want him to win, but he isn't an idol to me.
- I enjoy driving on the sim, doing stuff like that, staying at home.
- I haven't gone out of my way to seek advice from people I don't know.
- Overall there's going to be things I'm not great at.
- I think as long as I do a good job and put in all my effort to proving that I'm worth it, then everything should be fine.
- Even though I had won in other categories, I didn't have any expectations when I came into F1. Qualifying fifth, finishing sixth? I didn't expect it.
- I'm an all-or-nothing kind of guy, I guess.
- I used to watch some F1 races but I was never straightaway thinking 'that is what I want to do.'
- I tend not to really think about what other people say. I'd rather just try and focus on what I'm doing, try and win basically.
- I think sim racing helps. I have improved in areas and do it whenever I need to improve. You don't feel G-force and those things are probably the biggest things, that and the fear factor which you feel when you drive. Therefore, when I go on to the track I'm better.
- I saw MotoGP on TV first, before I saw F1 and other types of car racing. It's what I got more into. It was cool, there was good, exciting racing.
- I am sure there's going to be times when I do things wrong that no one's going to like and everyone's going to think I'm terrible and rubbish but I know I'm going to go through those times, and it's just about understanding that that's going to happen.
- It's just trying to do the best job I can in these opportunities that I get to show what I can do, be consistent, have good feedback, be fast, at the same time not make mistakes.
- I used to watch MotoGP quite a bit, I liked MotoGP. I had a motorbike before I had a go-kart and before I had a motorbike I had a quad bike but I was too dangerous, and before I did quad biking I did horse riding, so it's been a long journey.
- I raced with my brother from when I started to 2014 when I finished karting.
- Confidence is always a good thing to have going into the weekend. Especially where it's quite difficult to put the lap together.
- Every driver is different, so I just hope whatever I do is going to be good enough, because it's not that I just want to be with McLaren. I want to win with McLaren.
- I do things I love doing. Sometimes that is maybe going out to have a drink with friends, going out partying or whatever.
- I liked watching Rossi, his style, his colours and everything. He was someone I looked up to and until now he is still my only hero. He is the king of motorbikes and most people like Rossi mainly because he comes across as a pretty fun and good character. He is cool and has a good style and look.
- My dad kind of liked racing and motorsports, but wasn't a big fan, it wasn't like he watched every race or whatever.
- I am absolutely my own biggest critic.
- The biggest difference in the wet between F2 and F1 is that there's so much more power in F1 as being on the throttle earlier has a bigger advantage.
- It's rule number one, really - beating your teammate.
- I don't think there's any point going for second or third.
- You can only get to a certain point when you feel confident with the simulator and it always changes when you get to the track and you actually drive it for real for the first time.
- I had a much better view with the halo than I expected.
- That's one of the biggest things. Never being home, always traveling, having different interests and focusing on different things, just the time aspect of going back home and seeing them, you don't have that at all. It was a big sacrifice but, at the end of the day, it was worth it.
- I need to do well and show I'm a worthy driver in F1.
- In karting, in the European races, you have the cameras and the film crews and you do interviews. At around 13 I'd already started doing bit of media and it just increases more and more with every level you take, especially when you get into cars - and when you hit F1 it's an even higher step up. It's something you get used to over time.
- I've missed out on a lot of things, going out with friends.
- Well, it's looks like I've a love-hate thing going on with Monaco.
- I don't like drinking, basically.
- Of course it would be nice for everybody and myself if we could win but we can still have a personal or a team win if we achieve a target that is effectively a win for us.
- Growing up I've watched Lewis and aspired to have some of his attributes, mainly his speed. His raw pace is probably the best of everyone on the whole grid, so there are bits you want from different drivers.
- I can't remember what made my dad take us karting for the first time, I can't remember really. I was into motorsport by then and I knew everything, and every driver, it was around 2009, 2008. That's when I first properly knew about Formula One. Those were the days.
- To be announced as a race driver for McLaren is a dream come true.
- In the ideal world, if I was perfect, I'd be able to beat every teammate that I have, in every race.
- There's definitely going to be things that I'm not very good at, things I can improve.
- It seems like F1 is kind of going down that route, opening it up more to the public and letting them know what is going on, what you do, instead of just driving and going home.
- If McLaren give me a car, that's fine, but I don't tend to buy fancy stuff anyway or super-nice clothes.
- As a British driver, you get compared to Lewis and I get that. But when he came to McLaren, they were doing well and had a championship-winning car. I'm in a very different situation so I don't compare myself to his stats.
- I don't know who I would have been if I never watched MotoGP.
- I definitely wasn't anything special when I first started but I think I adapted quite quickly into racing and it became a bit better slowly. All of cadets, the first four years of karting, I only won one proper race, one! Which was the British Open Championship at PFI and I started 21st and I won.
- Having the support from everyone, the bosses, whoever within the team, definitely makes it much easier for me as a driver.
- I never enjoyed school and I was never that good at school so leaving wasn't the biggest thing, but the social aspect of school, leaving your friends, you lose contact with them a bit and now I have more friends at the race track than the friends I keep in touch with at school.
