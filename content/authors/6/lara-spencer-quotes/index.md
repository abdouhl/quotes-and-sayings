- I absolutely love American folk art, can't get enough of it.
- Flea markets tend to be overwhelming. A lot of times, when I go with a first-time shopper, they don't buy anything. The rooms in my new book involved real people with real design dilemmas. They were paralyzed to make a decision.
- 'Antiques Roadshow' is my favorite show. Every Monday night I have one hour of appointment television. I get the popcorn out and tell my husband, 'Don't bother me.'
- Flea markets are fun because they are the ultimate treasure hunt. Be open to the fact that you never know what you'll find. The most beautiful, quirky, funny, scary pieces may not have an intrinsic value.
- I think the reason I love 'Antiques Roadshow' is that it is sort of like the lottery. There's the chance a regular Joe could walk in with anything and come out close to a millionaire. There's the thrill of the find.
- Tennis is my favorite way to unwind, and it's a great family activity.
- I just want to say to anybody out there who suffers with chronic pain, I feel you. It takes over your life. It affects you emotionally, mentally, physically.
- Art can retain its value and even make you some money. If you have your iPhone on you - and you probably do - look for the artist's signature, and use that to look up the artist and get a sense of the piece's value before you buy it.
- Going from reporter to anchor is like going from wide receiver to quarterback. As anchor, you're running the plays and having the feel of the show - and knowing when to be more upbeat or slow down.
- My first taste of the business was the glamorous job of pulling camera cables so they wouldn't get tangled while the football games were filmed.
- Finding a new couch is a daunting process. New couches are not as soft or deep as you want. I prefer a long, single bench because then it becomes a day bed. These are things that you can buy at a flea market and make exactly what you want.
- I eat what I want, in moderation. I gravitate toward fresh veggies and clean foods, thankfully, but I am also a sucker for a cupcake every once in a while.
- I love going to tag sales, to auctions.
- If I don't eat something after I work out, I get shaky and cranky - not a good combination when you're a television host.
- I love charity thrift stores. Amazing one-of-a-kind pieces at terrific prices, and all the money you spend goes to a good cause.
- I try to be athletic.
- I love sports. I love being active. I love challenging myself. I was a jock growing up from the time I could walk.
- It's not a bargain if it has bedbugs.
- A mom has to be ready for anything.
- Being on TV is similar to being an athlete. You get no second chances.
- I always recommend rewiring vintage lighting. It's not a bargain if your house burns down.
- The way I see it, the perfect weekend getaway combines three things: seeing new places, eating delicious local food, and combing the local flea market for unique, one-of-a-kind finds.
- If my daughter has a bad dream and wants to get into my bed, I'm a sucker for her sweet face and warm body next to mine, so I let her jump in. I should tell her to go to bed, but secretly I love it.
- I was a diver. Looking back, I realize that putting yourself out there, literally, on the edge of the platform is very similar to doing live TV. It's taking the plunge and knowing, with lots of practice, it'll work out fine.
- Finding your style is like putting puzzle pieces together.
- I make sure to eat lots of kale, broccoli, blueberries, strawberries, and spinach.
- Hollywood regency never goes out of style.
- I'm so fortunate in my career to be able to share with viewers my travels and experiences with some amazing and talented people and to bring that inspiration to television, books, and the digital world.
- After college, I went into the NBC Page Program. It's one of those great programs that allows kids to get their feet wet in every area of the business.
