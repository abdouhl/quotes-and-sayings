- I think starting in anime, like I did, gave me a good idea of how to approach games that come from Japan. Japanese developers can be very different from companies here in the western market.
- It's fun to grow with a character over the course of a TV series. Video games are usually a much more condensed process.
- It's nice, because after you've worked with various directors and producers enough times, they start to know your voice and what you're capable of.
- I guess anime helped me understand the Japanese culture a little better and makes me want to honor certain language nuances that don't always translate to English.
