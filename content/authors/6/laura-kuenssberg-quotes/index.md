- Our political system seems to be proving itself almost incapable of dealing with what's been put before it. The decisions it is making, or fluffing, are so vital and yet are inevitably so compromised by the endless political calculations of all involved.
- It's worth knowing that there's very different sets of regulation for the print press and for broadcast media. They're different things, particularly during campaign periods.
- Politics is a tough business.
- Someone like Boris Johnson is reluctant to answer questions about ambition because then the story becomes all about his ambition. Sure, he's got ambition - that's no secret at all. But also, he's very strongly motivated to try to get the kind of Brexit he believes in.
- People are deciding - if they don't like a particular point of view or a particular paper, it goes out of business.
- Human beings rarely do things for a binary reason.
- There's always that tension between policy and personality in politics, and as voters, we have that, too: we all vote on issues, but we also vote on whether we like the people who are put forward.
- The BBC should mirror the country.
- I'm not friends with politicians. I'm not people's mate.
- What I was excited about was the opportunity for punters to be part of politics. The whole idea was to allow the voices of people outside this weirdo palace of Westminster to be heard. I thought the whole social media thing might be really positive.
- I would die in a ditch for the impartiality of the BBC.
- I think politics often seems remote, and anything we can do to show more of the workings - how you make the sausage - is useful.
- Twitter is a really interesting, useful tool. In lots of ways, it's an exciting place to be. But it's also a megaphone for the kinds of things people used to shout at their telly - and now they send you a message.
- We want people to watch and consume what we do, but we are not trying to sell anything. So that does give us a freedom in a way.
- I work long hours. I work very, very hard.
- I don't read the comments people write about me - it's not worth it.
- I'm well rewarded for a job I massively enjoy doing. I think I'm paid very fairly.
