quotes = ['''In my own life, I have found grief to be enormously distorting, particularly if it's sudden or extreme in nature.''' ,'''I think my favorite horror films are really grounded in human psychology, which is to say I think through sort of extreme dislocations of reality.''' ,'''I love Javier Marias; I love his novel 'Tomorrow in the Battle Think on Me.'''' ,'''Being scared by a movie offers a safe catharsis, because the terror is confined to the screen. It's an adrenalin spike, and when I come back down, I feel a bit more leveled.''' ,'''As a teenager, I struggled a lot, had several major depressive episodes, and ended up dropping out of high school and getting a GED.''' ,'''If you're working on a novel, whatever you do, don't say, 'I am almost finished with my novel.' It's worse than chanting Bloody Mary three times in front of a mirror.''' ,'''I think writing, or any form of art-making, is a way to prepare for not being here. Not that we can. No amount of preparing can really ready us, in a meaningful way, for the great void that awaits us all.''' ,'''I'm pretty sure that I've never confessed in an interview my weakness for McDonald's Filet-O-Fish. The cheese is fake. Who knows what that 'fish' really is. It is gross. It is amazing.''' ,'''Sometimes we talk about memory as though it's firm and fixed, but of course, memory is highly fluid and subjective and thus highly subject to manipulation.''' ,'''I really need so much time to really make headway on a novel that requires me to disappear from the world in a way.''' ,'''Holy cow - everything about writing a novel is hard for me.''' ,'''It's not easy to craft a novel that gradually erodes the reader's comprehension of the world, of reality and identity and the passage of time.''' ,'''A sense of play is important when I'm writing, and so messing around with, say, a magic routine can feel like play, at least initially.''' ,'''I think that one thing about teaching is you're trying to communicate your thoughts about a work to a group of people who may or may not share that sentiment. This has forced me to become a lot more articulate about what I respond to and what I don't respond to in fiction.''' ,'''To me, in general, something that's really rich in terms of identity about transit spaces is that they're so intimate. Especially thinking about long international flights when we're trying to sleep on the plane - we're total strangers, but we're sleeping next to each other.''' ,'''In the novels I most admire, there is this sense that, within the confines of the world, the possibilities are always opening in new and surprising ways - that was a quality I strived to capture, with the hope that the reader would be willing to follow me.''' ,'''If I'm really rolling with a short story, I work on it everywhere and end up with a finished draft in a couple months, but a novel really demands that I step out of my life and vanish into the world of the book.''' ,'''I think my concern is I know my voice, and I know the kinds of landscapes that interest me, so my primary concern is doing the most I can with those voices and those landscapes.''' ,'''On my first trip to Havana, I was stopped by a woman who turned out to be a Canadian tour guide and who had mistaken me for a woman who had been part of one of her tour groups.''' ,'''Fiction accesses a certain kind of truth through artifice. I love to create worlds that operate on their own terms.''' ,'''I lived in Florida until I was 22.''' ,'''Early influences included Lorrie Moore, Amy Hempel, Charles Baxter, Richard Ford, Alice Munro, Denis Johnson - writers who are important to me still and who I discovered through my teachers.''' ,'''Not long after watching 'The Passenger,' I wrote the first lines of 'The Isle of Youth,' which concerns twin sisters who swap identities and become ensnared in the Miami underworld.''' ,'''I do not work well when I am in living in a cyclone of panic. I reject actively seeking out destabilization and suffering as a creative model.''' ,'''Children exist in the worlds that adults create for them, both locally and globally, and their options are, by virtue of age, often painfully limited.''' ,'''Florida is a very idiosyncratic place in a lot of ways - as are many parts of our fine country, but one could say Florida is particularly idiosyncratic.''' ,'''In terms of specific cinematic influences, certainly I'd recommend 'Juan de los Muertos,' and I also really love this French zombie movie - 'Les Revenants' - where the dead reanimate for no apparent reason.''' ,'''The moment when my husband and I clasped hands and turned from our officiant, newly wed, was the most light-filled of my life.''' ,'''Like many American readers, I was first introduced to Magda Szabo's work when New York Review Books reissued the Hungarian master's profound and haunting novel 'The Door.'''' ,'''In August 2008, I moved with the man who would become my husband from Boston to a cabin in rural North Carolina.''' ,'''I've always been most drawn to fiction that wrestles with that death-fear. Sometimes I joke with my students, 'If no one is in danger of dying, I'm not interested,' but of course I'm not really joking.''' ,'''When I'm absorbed in a work of fiction, time and place melts away, as though I've drifted away from my usual reality and been absorbed into another.''' ,'''As for me, I was a lonely kid, with few close friends until I was an adult - even when I might have been perceived as being on the inside, I felt like I was on the outside, kind of like viewing the world through a sheet of glass.''' ,'''My students are often asking me, 'What do you think are the most important qualities for a writer?' And one thing I always tells them is that it's helpful to be willing to sit in a space of uncertainty. There are entire years, especially with novels, where you really don't know where the project is going.''' ,'''As a genre, the best horror poses central human questions - Who can you trust? What is the cost of our secrets? What is our relationship to history? What are we blind to? What evils are lurking under the smooth surface of the self? - through radical dislocations.''' ,'''Normally I'm the type who wouldn't bail on a responsibility unless dead on the side of the road, and I believe deeply in the importance of continuing to follow our own paths.''' ,'''I love creating mysteries, but I am terrible at solving them.''' ,'''I know some writers that have a million novel ideas, but I don't.''' ,'''I once took a workshop with Jim Shepard, and he has this term, 'rate-of-revelation,' that has come to mean a lot to me: 'the pace at which we're learning crucial emotional information about the stories' central figures.' An ever-increasing rate-of-revelation is good; a stagnant r-of-r is not.''' ,'''We're all trying to figure out on a daily basis what kind of person to be, aren't we? I am, at least.''' ,''''Find Me' I think, is brooding in a very literal sense of the word in that you have all of these sort of interior storm that's growing within Joy over the course of the book and leading her to her moment. And certainly, I think there's an aspect of the supernatural.''' ,'''For three years, I lived in a miniscule apartment on Beacon Street, less than a mile from the Boston Marathon explosions.''' ,'''In 'The Third Hotel,' my narrator, Claire, is wrestling with this sense of perpetual unfinishedness. She's trying to make sense of her husband's death, how someone's life can just stop and not continue, and of the lack of resolution in her own inner life.''' ,'''I have no problem quitting things, because I have a horror of boredom.''' ,'''Often, contrasts bring art to life: the bright speck of paint on a dark canvas; the tightrope walk between humor and tragedy.''' ,'''Like many artists, I have issues with anxiety and depression, so I try to live in a way that supports my mental health.''' ,'''I take a pretty expansive view of craft, which is to say I don't see craft as just being technique - it's also process; subject; ideas and feelings; visions and dreams; the words that are put down and the words that are avoided.''' ,'''As a young writer, I was sort of sailing around trying to 'find my voice' - for lack of a better term - and I was really chafing against the very minimal brand of domestic realism that I'd read so much of in college.''' ,'''When I'm working on a short story, I could duck into a bathroom at a crowded party and write a scene, which is to say I can work in a very incremental way.''' ,'''I am a pretty omnivoracious reader in respect to prose style, but if the prose doesn't have its own music, if the relationship to the sentence seems unconsidered or superficial, I have a really hard time reading the work.''' ,'''In the world of the American creative writing workshop, I've encountered teachers who are tempted to place, or have actually placed, a moratorium on child narrators. Students love to write them, but children come laden with complications.''' ,'''Ever since I started writing in college, I have, save for a few short breaks here and there, been working away on something. I love it, I need it, and so it never occurred to me to put writing on the back burner.''' ,'''I love many realists but very strongly resist the notion that realism presents a less stylized, more authentic version of the world.''' ,'''If we can think of a place, the physicality of a place, as a kind of 'material,' I would say the landscape of Florida in particular was especially important while writing 'Isle.'''' ,'''Unlike a novel, where you expect a different kind of arc that leaves us with a somber sense of resolution, I think a story in some ways as like a train window: being able to watch the landscape pass for a certain amount of time. And then your stop arrives, and you have to leave.''' ,'''Publishing at a young age is not really an indicator of talent.''' ,'''Youth is such a fascinating and volatile concoction of vulnerability, dependence, restlessness, relentlessness. You're still learning the terms of the world and of the self, in a very immediate way.''' ,'''Florida is a most unusual place. It can feel at once stifling and like anything is possible there.''' ,'''As we know all too well, our early years are formative in ways it can takes us a lifetime to grasp. Those years leave deep marks; in that way, the stakes of childhood are inherently very high.''' ,'''A collection is, by my lights, a chance to build a universe, an overarching ecosystem. But it's common enough to encounter a hodgepodge instead, where flashes of brilliance are undercut by clunkers.''' ,'''Paradoxically, the only thing that helps when I'm feeling despairing about writing is to write.''' ,'''America loves a good comeback story!''' ,'''I can't write anything if I don't know where it's set, where the events are happening - even if the details of setting are minimal.''' ,'''If I leave the fictional world for too long, it's a bit like stepping through a portal, entering another reality, and then not knowing how to get back to where you were before.''' ,'''I think where a writer falls on the realism/non-realism continuum has a lot to do with their sight, as in, 'This is how I see the world.' And it seems my sight is off-kilter and kind of strange, but I come by that naturally; I'm not consciously pushing toward a particular point on the continuum.''' ,'''I've always found the Write-What-You-Know axiom small and stifling.''' ,'''I think, in a lot of ways, if you really strip down some of the most compelling novels, in a lot of ways, they're detective stories.''' ,'''When I was in grad school, my husband and I used to house sit for a couple in Harvard Square, so we have these amazing memories of great Cambridge summers.''' ,'''Here's something a little more personal: In my teens, I was having a hard time and ended up in a therapy group of young women, some of whom had endured terrible childhood traumas.''' ,'''To a certain degree, I think both self-narrativizing and selective memory are essential survival skills.''' ,'''I wager we have a vast amount of literature out there that tends to the stories of men, so I've never really worried too much about attending to stories of women.''' ,'''Since childhood, I've been a fan of mysteries - 'Nancy Drew' lovers unite! - but 'Vertigo' struck me as an entirely new take on the genre.''' ,'''Anxiety and doubt are among my biggest struggles as a writer.''' ,'''There's the public self that we present to the outer world. There's the private self, which maybe takes more time to access. But ultimately, what I'm most interested in as a writer is a few notches below the private self.''' ,'''I love noir, quite obviously.''' ,'''It puzzles me when writers say they can't read fiction when they're writing fiction because they don't want to be influenced. I'm totally open to useful influence. I'm praying for it.''' ,'''I am temperamentally drawn to work that shoves the strange and normal against one another, it's true, although I don't see the 'strange' and the 'normal' as being two separate categories of experience; for me, they are intertwined, hard to separate.''' ,'''I lived in Boston for three years, and during that time, I wrote my first collection of stories, 'What the World Will Look Like When All the Water Leaves Us;' other stories that didn't make it into the collection; and several failed novel openings.''' ,'''Culturally, there is often the expectation that women should be repelled by anything too ugly, too violent.''' ,'''Children tell themselves stories, engage in self-delusion and fantasy, but those narratives are more evolving than calcified - and with that malleability comes both freedom and danger.''' ,'''The kind of dystopian books that I've always loved the most are the ones where you find yourself in a world that's less scorched-earth and instead a world that has just been made different.''' ,'''The short story has been here and is here and will be here as long as we are.''' ,'''I realized that, for me, travel for work - I'm not speaking so much about travel for pleasure - had actually become a way of avoiding life.''' ,'''As a reader, I appreciate a world that feels unsettled and also visceral, inhabitable, so that's a quality I try and bring to my own work. In this way, dislocation and precision make total sense to me as a unit.''' ,'''We write in a culture that favors the heft of the novel. Better still if the novel in question is large enough to be wielded interchangeably as a doorstop and a weapon.''' ,'''Whether it's via the monstrous or the paranormal, horror actually can really get at some of the most fundamental human questions.''' ,'''When I'm between projects, I keep a journal I call a 'thought log,' and it's my practice to write down whatever interests me.''' ,'''When I first left Florida for Boston, I was so eager to shed my Floridian identity, perhaps some of my earlier surreal gestures felt hollow and unconvincing because they were not rising from the particular brand of the uncanny I knew best.''' ,'''With both novels and short stories, I think a lot in terms of character arcs, when it comes to endings.''' ,'''I've had a somewhat typical experience in that many of the contemporary writers I was exposed to early on were white and often male.''' ,'''I think we're often guilty of gravitating towards the familiar. Even if we recognize that certain patterns are unsatisfying and destructive, there can still be a comfort in the familiar recognition of a cycle repeating itself.''' ,'''I was born and raised in Orlando, where the economy and culture has been powerfully shaped by tourism, and so I've long been interested in how we narrate the places we visit, how the gap between what we see and what we know manifests when we're traveling.''' ,'''I teach fiction in my workshops, and some of the readings could be classified as horror. For example, 'House Taken Over,' a short story by Julio Cortazar, is a work I regularly teach.''' ,'''In fiction, we are not bound by social convention, so the things that mystify and unsettle are allowed to rise to the surface.''' ,'''I am an incorrigible eavesdropper, so I am very much influenced by what I hear.''' ,'''Havana is a uniquely complicated city and contains a great many histories.''' ,'''The past is an open wound, a life force busily shaping an increasingly bewildering present.''' ,'''I tend to be drawn to characters who are not rule followers, who behave in unexpected and unusual ways.''' ,'''I always tell my students that, in fiction, the opening is a clue to the work's DNA: not only what it is, but what it will become, where it will lead you.''' ,'''I'm such a first-person writer.''' ,]
