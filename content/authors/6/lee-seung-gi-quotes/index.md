- In 'Vagabond,' I'm acting like a gangster; it's very tough. I have to use my body for action scenes, and there is nothing gentlemanly about this character at all.
- I think what I can do is to focus more on what I'm good at and see if I can improve on these positive qualities so that I can continue on the path I'm on now.
- Most of my acting has been for fantasy-based shows like 'A Korean Odyssey.' But for 'Vagabond,' it is totally different.
- PSY is a legend. I am just proud that a world star has risen from Korea and that a longtime friend was met with such astounding success.
- I hope K-dramas can make inroads into more Asian countries.
- Many guys seem to think that his thoughts and feelings are always right and always the best option. I think I am the same kind of guy.
- I think efforts sometimes don't get rewarded.
- I am always ready for anything.
- Unlike office workers who improve their profession with repeated daily practice, entertainers don't have any work manual or daily workload. But, I personally set my daily workload, trying hard to invest a set amount of time to improve myself, like other professionals.
- I learned that one's mentality can influence how they react to physical obstacles.
- Being in the special forces has really broken a lot of the limitations I thought I had. Thoughts like 'We've done this much, so we should take a break now' were ones that I had to ignore and overcome in my training. They taught me how to keep going, no matter how difficult a situation can get.
- When acting, I can wear another person's clothes and act out the attractiveness of a particular character, which is very interesting for me. Singing is something I love as well.
- Men and women are different, and they can never read each other's mind.
- Lee Seung-gi before the army and Lee Seung-gi after the army are totally different. Firstly, I've matured a lot. I used to feel pressured by a lot of things before fulfilling my military duties. Now, I'm proud that I've become more confident.
