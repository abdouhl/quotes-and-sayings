- We know that the expansion of our universe is accelerating, which means a number called the cosmological constant must be positive.
- Every string theory that's been written down says the speed of light is universal. But other ideas about quantum gravity predict the speed of light has actually increased.
- How we think about the future and the past determines everything about how we think about our situation as human beings.
- General relativity predicts that time ends inside black holes because the gravitational collapse squeezes matter to infinite density.
- If string theory is a mistake, it's not a trivial mistake. It's a deep mistake and therefore kind of worthy.
- Science moves fastest when there's plenty of debate and controversy.
- There certainly is a tension between the relativity of simultaneity and non-locality in quantum theory, but it's not strong enough to add up to a falsification of either side by itself.
- When we human beings hypothesize that a law of nature holds - even temporarily or situationally - we are creating an idea, but we are also making a hypothesis about how nature behaves, whose truth or usefulness has nothing to do with what we know or believe.
