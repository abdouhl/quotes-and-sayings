- I got a little bit pleased with myself. I didn't buy a Rolls-Royce or anything like that but I didn't see my biological family for a while. I was getting a bit self-important and they told me. They dragged me back.
- If I go out to a house and it's half empty I prefer to think it's half full. And I trust people. Even if it all goes wrong you go again.
- My whole break-up with Amanda Holden was in the papers for three years and my dogs were photographed being taken for walks more than any in Britain. They're two Cairn terriers. I don't have them now, though, she has them.
- I am a very honest, open person and I think there is a tendency in celebrity autobiographies to gloss over certain things which have happened.
- Being a parent is a tiring business.
- And if I hadn't done 'Celebrity Big Brother', I wouldn't have got 'Extras', so in the long run what was seen as a terrible mistake turned out well.
- It annoys me how expensive it is to live in London, but I think that annoys everyone.
- Phil's a lovely, lovely boy. He's 33, but I still call him my 'boy'. He was young when 'Family Fortunes' started, and there's a lovely photo of him holding up a clapperboard for me on set.
- I've never watched any videos of my time on 'Celebrity Big Brother'. Honestly. It's something I could save for when I'm an old man. It was a watershed, the catalyst to the end of my second marriage.
- On the old passports, mine used to say 'entertainer', but now on forms I say 'actor'. But I still worry that people will think I'm a charlatan.
- My thing has always been to change tack, do something that challenges me.
- I hoped doing 'Celebrity Big Brother' would reboot my career: if you can't beat them, join them. It's tough because you want to be known for your work rather than just for who you are, you know?
- Extras changed the public's perception of me hugely - they saw there was more to me than just this bloke off the telly.
- I'd love to do Shakespeare. I've been asked to do Malvolio but for one reason or another haven't been able. On a school trip to the Royal Shakespeare Company at Stratford I saw the great Emrys James as Feste and it's always been a role I've coveted.
- When I power-walk with a couple of mates, it's like a men's club. We talk about what it's like to be, well, men. It works as exercise and therapy.
- I resisted emotional involvement for a while because I didn't believe it could work.
- As a young comedian playing the working men's clubs in the 70s, I'd been in awe of Dustin Gee.
- Every city has comedians who tap into local culture and have success but don't travel well.
- I made the decision to go on stage after my father died. And he would have wanted me to. But I won't try and plug huge grief up with the false world of show-business ever again.
- I do sometimes stop and think. I mean, I'm 62 now and I've got a child on my shoulders and he could be my grandson.
- I can remember going to the north-east clubs and having the hardest time of my life on stage and saying to myself, 'I'm not coming off.' And I would go through an hour's material in 20 minutes.
- Try your best not to let others down, and don't do anything that will lose you sleep at night.
- But the one thing you can say about me is that I'm very resilient. I always bounce back. I'm like a rubber ball.
- I wish people would listen rather than rush around in their own world. There's a danger that we are becoming stuck in a bubble and losing the ability to communicate.
- If I'd been doing the cabaret circuit or the club circuit or the Saturday night telly that was around in the 80s, I wouldn't be around any more, because those shows have fallen by the wayside. So I have had to keep changing.
- I changed Philip's nappies when he was a baby and did my fair share of getting up and rocking him to sleep. Bringing up a little girl will be a different experience for me.
- I am a big self-doubter. I suffer from Impostor Syndrome. Whenever I start a new job, I think: 'I'm going to be found out.' I don't have a huge ego or enormous belief in my own talent.
- One thing that continues to worry me is Phil's naivety. It's lovely in ways, but as his dad I don't want him ever to be taken advantage of because of his niceness.
- I wish I'd gone to university. I had the opportunity to go to Oxford but by then I'd already started as a comedian.
- A lot of the comics called me Bronco because I wouldn't get off - if I had to do an hour, I would stand there, even if it wasn't going well. I knew comics that would climb out of dressing room windows after they'd done their first spot.
- Every night in 'Hairspray' we will be doing a vocal warmup, so I hope that will improve the muscles. It is a muscle, and we've not been using it - anybody that is on stage, that is.
- I love coming to Edinburgh and last time I was here, Claire and I found out we were expecting our daughter Eleanor, so it's a place dear to my heart.
- There have been some bad times, some very low points in my life. Doing 'Celebrity Big Brother' was certainly one of them. When I came out my phone didn't ring for a very long time.
