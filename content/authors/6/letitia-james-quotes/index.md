Once our nation's largest city does so, I know other states and municipalities will follow suit.''' ,'''We cannot justly seek to expand access to HASA and enroll more New Yorkers in the program, if we do not act to improve the program to ensure that tenants receive the benefits and services they are entitled to.''' ,'''It's clear that the NYPD has prioritized creating a force as diverse as the vibrant city it protects.''' ,'''Like with all other crime, we must, of course, treat the perpetrators of these actions as the criminals they are. But unlike with the vast majority of other crime, justice is not delivered simply by punishing the perpetrator. This is because the harm associated with domestic violence extends far beyond the point of contact.''' ,'''In reality, handing over public space to private developers does not guarantee that new library spaces will be comparable in size or otherwise remain fully-functional.''' ,'''I know what it's like to be on public assistance and to be unemployed.

They're basically kitchen-roundtable discussions about issues in the City of New York, because you can learn more by listening.''' ,'''On the local, state and federal level, government is working alongside veteran's organizations and other stakeholders to provide services such as medical assistance, employment resources, and housing support to veterans and their dependents and survivors. But there are still gaps in services that must be rectified.''' ,'''Wage discrimination lasts forever. The disparity haunts women beyond their years in the labor force, impacting how much they save for retirement and ultimately receive in Social Security benefits.''' ,'''No person should live in poverty after a life of hard work.''' ,'''Dysfunction in Washington has stalled any meaningful federal action on gun control. So it's increasingly up to big cities like New York to take bold steps to get weapons off our streets and change the national discourse.''' ,'''Human induced climate change is real, and the evidence is right in front of us. It threatens our shores. It promises to bring intense heat waves and powerful storms. It has the power to disrupt our economy, endanger our food supply, and imperil global stability. We must take action to stop it.''' ,'''Our system of government works best when there are checks and balances led by independent entities that are empowered to conduct fair and rigorous oversight. These are the same principles enshrined in the founding document of our country - our Constitution.''' ,'''We must ensure that we are hiring and retaining qualified, diverse candidates not only to teach in our classrooms, but to work at the DOE overseeing our students' education.''' ,'''Each day, millions of police officers do the selfless work of putting their lives on the line to protect civilians, frequently responding to or preventing crises completely with no recognition.''' ,'''I come from humble beginnings myself.''' ,'''Being underpaid once shouldn't condemn you to a lifetime of inequality.''' ,'''Children of domestic violence, of course, suffer terrible consequences.''' ,'''All New Yorkers have the right to decent housing, regardless of income and rent.''' ,'''Our evenly matched rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness require an equal paycheck.''' ,'''Retirement shouldn't be making the choice between buying much-needed medication or putting food on the table; making the choice between heating an apartment in the cold winter months or paying rent; making the choice between paying a phone bill or seeing a doctor.''' ,'''Putting cops on streets is the most effective way to combat crime.''' ,'''The status quo is clearly broken, and we must strive for bigger, bolder solutions that will provide New Yorkers with the support they need to remain in their homes.''' ,'''Every hard working New Yorker, regardless of their income, race, or gender deserves an equal shot at attaining retirement security.''' ,'''For generations America and its institutions have refused to acknowledge the true severity of the harm that domestic violence imposes on our society.''' ,'''Some contractors force workers to provide paybacks to keep their jobs. Others intentionally misclassify workers in order to underpay them - by, for example, paying a skilled construction worker as a general laborer.''' ,'''New Yorkers would be shocked to learn of the conditions some construction workers in our city toil under.''' ,'''When it comes to climate change and the environment, President Donald Trump is plain wrong.''' ,'''I say that our economic future is in the new technology that will lead to more fuel efficient cars and cleaner energy.''' ,'''As Public Advocate for the City of New York, I will be working with the Administration for Children's Services and others to bring about necessary reforms - and ensure that our city meets its most solemn responsibility - protecting the welfare of our children.''' ,'''Legally, many contractors are required to pay a prevailing wage. However, bad actors often find ways to get around this requirement.''' ,'''Gunfire tracking technology is improving every day and has been successful in many jurisdictions around the country.''' ,'''We must stand vigilant to protect our voting access.''' ,'''For all the manufactured 'Republican versus Democrat' drama that dominates today's cable news and political rhetoric, the most striking feature of our present-day democracy is not partisan divide - it's a corrupt system that protects incumbents from the consequences that real democracy brings.''' ,'''Before any family is placed in any type of shelter, there must be a thorough, top-to-bottom, building-wide inspection.

Too often, women will have a lower salary history, and, therefore get a lower offer.''' ,'''New York should be a place where everyone can afford to live.''' ,'''The reality is that I've been counted out for a very long time and people continue to underestimate me and I continue to overperform.''' ,'''The workers who get hurt by corner-cutting often do not realize they are being wronged. Even when they do, they do not have the support and resources to fight back. Without a union to stand behind them, these workers are forced to stay in bad jobs, or face no job at all.''' ,'''A comfortable retirement should not only be a luxury for the wealthy, but a reality for every New Yorker.''' ,'''The NYPD has taken steps to engage marginalized communities and attempts to bridge gaps between these neighborhoods and those sworn to protect and serve them.''' ,'''To my dismay, inadequate signage, non-ADA compliant ramps, narrow doorways, and poorly-placed voting machines are preventing hundreds of thousands of people from exercising one of our most basic rights as Americans.''' ,'''I have never had doubts about the courage of the young men and women we sent overseas wearing the uniform.''' ,'''In today's world, access to the Internet is inarguably critical to function in informal and formal spaces - and the costs to digital segregation are rising.''' ,'''Is truth about domestic violence and those who enable it more important than a company's corporate partnerships? I think so.''' ,'''Brown v. Board of Education was arguably the most important decision of the Supreme Court in the 20th century.''' ,'''More cops on our streets and in our neighborhoods mean safer streets and neighborhoods.''' ,'''If accessing the Internet becomes more difficult for low-income communities, academic and employment competition may be undermined, and could damage the prospects of upward mobility for low-income New Yorkers and further exacerbate income inequality.''' ,'''Most of those whom we honor on Memorial Day died young. They never had the chance to raise a family, build a career, attend the weddings of their children, or be honored in old age.''' ,'''Within New York City and state, families in need face a confusing hodgepodge of supplemental rental assistance programs, many of which are ineffective individually and all of which are clearly ineffective in the aggregate.''' ,'''I come from a long line of very strong, tough women.

As the enforcers of law and order, they have to adhere to the letter of the law and minimize the taints of biases and life long social conditioning.''' ,'''I've got a moral center.''' ,'''While New York City cannot prevent other jurisdictions from selling firearms, it has taken a powerful stance against guns by divesting pension funds from gun manufacturers.''' ,'''During my campaign for Public Advocate, and Mayor Bill de Blasio's campaign for mayor, we committed to making Eid school holidays a reality.''' ,'''Establishing the two Eids as official holidays will carry important practical and symbolic significance.''' ,'''Without a doubt, the most fiscally responsible way to increase the number of officers on our streets is to mobilize uniformed officers in administrative jobs and to use civilian employees to fill those jobs.''' ,'''Walmart markets its gun department as 'sports and outdoors,' but let us get one thing straight: They are not just selling hunting rifles.''' ,'''The vast majority of our men and women in uniform are doing the right thing.''' ,'''Part of the reason why I wanted to be involved in politics was to create and be a part of policy changes.''' ,'''As we express our gratitude to veterans for protecting our freedom, it is imperative that we provide them the necessary services and benefits they rightfully deserve.''' ,'''New York's buildings must be cleaner and more energy-efficient.''' ,'''Only when we ensure that the mistakes of our past are not the vision for our future, will we truly have achieved justice.''' ,'''I was not born with a silver spoon in my mouth.''' ,'''Home Stability Support is our best shot at creating an all-encompassing and effective system to ensure that our at-risk children and families can remain in the homes they deserve.''' ,'''World Aids Day is both a day of remembrance and a day of hope.''' ,'''Wage violations are tantamount to theft.''' ,'''The vast majority of our teachers, our principals and our PTAs are well informed and well meaning, but even those with the best intentions can benefit from cultural competency training.''' ,'''Telling the truth about domestic violence - and those who shield it - should not be punished.''' ,'''New Yorkers want to be compassionate, and they want to live in a city where homeless people aren't stuffed into shelters, spilling out onto the streets. They also want a support system that works.''' ,'''Any district attorney knows that an endorsement from law enforcement unions is vital to earning voters' trust. As a result, police unions play an outsized role in district attorney elections.''' ,'''I come from a family of eight on public assistance, my parents were separated. My mother struggled, my father struggled.''' ,'''As Public Advocate for the City of New York, I have a duty to speak truth to power and do what is best for our City and its residents.''' ,'''All of my life and particularly throughout of my public career, I have been talking about the feminization of poverty.

It's absolutely critically important.''' ,'''Our justice system allows district attorneys to be charged with the great responsibility of prosecuting the very same police officers they work side-by-side with every day and whose union support they seek when running for reelection.''' ,'''Around the nation, lawmakers have drawn up their districts with such perverse precision and aversion to competition, that legislators rarely face competitive challenges.''' ,'''Under the not-so-watchful eye of ACS, children continue to die avoidable deaths. This is beyond unacceptable and betrays our moral conscience.''' ,'''The scales of justice often, in my head, are unbalanced. And so my job is to try to balance out those scales.''' ,]
