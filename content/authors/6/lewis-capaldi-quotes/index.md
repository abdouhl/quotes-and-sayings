quotes = ['''I started off playing my own songs, just because I saw it as a means to an end almost of, 'Right, if you want to play gigs, you have to write your own songs.' I mean, they were absolutely terrible.''' ,'''I see all these posts saying, 'I met Lewis Capaldi,' and in the picture, I look like a melting hippo.''' ,'''When I first started out, they were like, 'Is there anybody that you like that you want to work with, and we'll see what we can do?' And I went, 'I like Malay,' who's Frank Ocean's producer, and they were like, 'Not going to happen.' It did seem so, like, high-in-the-sky sort of thing, do you know what I mean? It still does, that it happened.''' ,'''I tweeted that I wanted Little Mix's 'Touch' played at my funeral - I think that'd be a great song to send me into the abyss.''' ,'''I would have been happy being in a wedding band.''' ,'''In hindsight, I think my manager and I both knew that 'Someone You Loved' was a special song that we had to put out. But no one was expecting it to do so well.''' ,'''Playing live and making a living from music was always the only goal.''' ,'''I was doing a wee gig at the Edinburgh Fringe, and while I was walking down to the show from the train station, someone stopped and asked if they could get a picture with me. This was about six months before I released my first single as well, so my response was, 'Are you sure?'''' ,'''Trust me, I do not have an online strategy.''' ,'''My goal was to play 350-capacity rooms in the U.K. and, if I was lucky, 100-capacity rooms in Europe. I just wanted to play music and make money off it.''' ,'''I played a lot of pubs, and some were a bit rougher than others, but once you got on, it was the same reception everywhere.''' ,'''I get lots of requests from people to write sad songs, and I'm like, 'No, that's rubbish patter.'''' ,'''I saw Marti Pellow in pantomime in Glasgow one time.''' ,'''I like social media.''' ,'''Everyone always tells you about how amazing recording their first album was and how they'll always look back on the 'process' with fond memories. I will look back on it as an extremely stressful time that somehow also managed to be extremely boring.''' ,'''If you're writing about what you're feeling about something, then you're in good stead.''' ,'''People take music too seriously.''' ,'''I'm not trying to reinvent the wheel. I'm just writing songs that I like, and that's where I've always come from.''' ,'''I would love to do something with Bill Withers just because I think he's next-level, just so, so class!''' ,'''The first artist whose music I really got into was Paolo Nutini. When his album 'Sunny Side Up' came out, I think I listened to it on repeat for, like, six months.''' ,'''For me, getting my personality across is so important in getting that connection for people that enjoy my music.''' ,'''I used to do covers gigs that would be 90 minutes, with a 30 minute break, then another 90.''' ,'''If you take yourself too seriously, something like a bad review could put you off your stride.''' ,'''The first time I played in front of a live audience, I realised I wanted to be a musician. I was about four years old and had always liked music.''' ,'''I think you just have to be yourself instead of catering your sound to a specific audience, make the music you want to make, and the audience will find you.''' ,'''It doesn't matter how big the shows are, as long as I'm making a living playing music. That's all that matters to me.''' ,'''My eldest brother is six years older than me.''' ,'''I like talking to anyone that will listen.''' ,'''I wanna be as transparent as possible. I'm not a serious guy.''' ,'''I'm under no illusion. There are lots of male singers out there with raspy voices.''' ,'''Doing a festival in Hong Kong was special, looking out and seeing this massive crowd and the city.''' ,'''I never set out to have a No. 1 single, not at all, man.''' ,'''I've been ghosted by all four members of Little Mix.''' ,'''For me, there's bands like Frightened Rabbit and The View, and they've all had that Scottish accent. It's just class to hear it.''' ,'''Having lots of human interaction online and during shows is very important to me.''' ,'''People like Sam Cooke and Otis Redding - I do not put myself in that category.''' ,'''I was born in Glasgow and brought up in a place in between Glasgow and Edinburgh called West Lothian!''' ,'''If you don't feel comfortable talking about really personal things in your music, you shouldn't do it. There's plenty of other things to write about.''' ,'''I would have been happy teaching music in schools - I still would be, and I still might be, although I don't know if I'm clever enough.''' ,'''If it's just going to go in my body, then I don't want fancy things in my body. I just want regular things in my body.''' ,'''Whether it's a song that might deviate from an artists' usual sound or even if it's still very much in their world, I think the more people opening themselves up creatively to collaborate with others, the better.''' ,'''I remember hearing people like Joe Cocker, Fleetwood Mac, and Elvis. My parents were big fans of them, and they were the early seeds. My brother was more into Slipknot, and I still listen to them, too, but it wasn't until I listened to Paolo Nutini that it really clicked.''' ,'''The sooner you start writing songs, the sooner you'll get better.''' ,'''I think soul singers are much better singers than I am.''' ,'''I did my HNC and my HND at college in Motherwell, and the plan I had was to do third year at uni and then to try and get into teaching.''' ,'''I think if you don't expect anything from the world, you'll have a lovely time.''' ,'''Even if 'Bruises' had done a fraction of what it did, I would have thought that was class.''' ,'''The fact you have to pay 50p to use the loo in some places is the root of the world's issues.''' ,'''It's the actual recording of the vocal that is the most boring thing you'll ever do in your life.''' ,'''Why would you want a picture with a wee, chubby guy from Bathgate? I just don't understand my appeal.''' ,'''I want to prove myself.''' ,'''I had gigged so much from the age of 11 to 20 that I got to a stage where I actually got less nervous the bigger the gig. But you need those butterflies: they make you feel alive.''' ,'''I had never released any music until 'Bruises' came out when I was 20.''' ,'''It's such a weird thing nowadays, too, when people are fans of the songs and not the bands.''' ,'''Even the idea of people paying to hear me shouting into a microphone for an hour is alien to me - and I hope it always will be.''' ,'''I think the first thing you release should come from you. If you want your first piece to be exactly how you want it to be, and how you see it, you should release it yourself.''' ,'''When I was, like, 17 or 18 and didn't really have anything I needed to buy, we would do these pub gigs for some cash and would usually just spend our wage back in the pub immediately after.''' ,'''I think my best songs come from me sitting at a piano, bashing my head against a brick wall for hours and hours on end to get one good melody.''' ,'''I'll be on Tinder until the day I die.''' ,'''Anything I wrote before the age of 17 is probably worth putting a pin in and moving on.''' ,'''I'm just a wee, chubby boy that happens to sing songs.''' ,'''I always wanted to play festivals more than anything in Scotland.''' ,'''I never thought I'd get to the point where I'd be able to release a proper album, and I absolutely never thought that when I did, I would give it a name as stupid I have, but here we are.''' ,'''It's when I'm playing a headline show I feel weird, 'cause I don't know how to react to people coming out to see me.''' ,'''My star will probably continue to rise, and I will start hanging out with Beyonce and Jay-Z and take them to a Toby Carvery.''' ,'''I've got quite a loud voice.''' ,'''A top 100 single was never on the cards for me, really, like in my own head.''' ,'''I don't blame people or 'pop stars' or whatever for being so quiet, but you can't take it too seriously, especially on social media. It's a very hard thing to be yourself, especially when people are watching, so I don't blame them for being a bit reserved.''' ,'''My mum and dad have made Twitter accounts, and they will send me links if there is a bad review and tell me they'll find out where the reviewer lives.''' ,'''I have been gigging around Glasgow and Edinburgh since I was 12. I played in pubs at that age, even though I obviously was too young to be in them. So I used to hide in bathrooms, come out and play my set, then get the hell out as quickly as possible.''' ,'''When I was 13, I went on 'Britain's Got Talent.' I auditioned. I sang a cover of a song called 'White Blank Page' by Mumford & Sons.''' ,'''For me, I feel most at home when I'm playing live.''' ,'''A lot of people say that 'the best songs fall into your lap' and that they're the easiest ones to write and take the shortest amount of time: I wholeheartedly disagree with that.''' ,'''I'd be up for the 'Bond' theme, and I'd put my name forward for the lead role. If they want a wee, chubby guy from Scotland, then I'm their man.''' ,'''I love playing live; that's the main thing. But I hate being in the studio. It's the most boring thing ever.''' ,'''When I was about 9, my brother, who's six years older than me, started getting guitar lessons, and I wouldn't say that it inspired me to pick up an instrument: it was more me being like, 'Well, if he's getting guitar lessons, then so am I. I'm not missing out,' type of thing.''' ,'''I don't think writing open-ended lyrics is necessarily an important part of writing good pop songs.''' ,]
