- Some actors need to be rattled and some need to be focused.

- I love my mother and father. The older I get, the more I value everything that they gave me.

- I struggle with the idea of comparing people's work and art. The notion of giving awards or putting a competitive spin on something that is a relative art form is sort of odd to me.

- I'm a typically lazy person. It is sort of characteristic of actors.
- No offense to the Canadians, but I believe location is like a character, and authenticity really matters.

One of the things he said when one of the 'Spotlight' reporters asked him how he could still remain a Catholic, he said that, 'My faith is in the eternal, and the church is an organization.'

- My grandfather was raising me, and in many respects, I was trying to understand what it meant to be a man. He was my role model.
- I didn't think that a career in theater was very realistic so I thought the only thing I could make money doing and still be somewhat artistic was, god help me, advertising.
