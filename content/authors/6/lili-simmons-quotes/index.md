quotes = ['''I don't know if I was popular in high school. My school was actually not really clique-y, which was nice. I went to a very artsy school, so everyone was kind of friends with each other. I was trying to be popular more, like, in junior high and elementary school and dealt with all that backstabbing and drama.''' ,'''I think teen girls will like 'Geek Charming' because they really focus on the 'populars' and nerdy people and people who are in between the nerds and between the populars. So it really hits every category of what girls are going through in high school.''' ,'''I remember liking 'A Cinderella Story' with Hilary Duff a lot when I was younger. I loved that movie, but maybe it was because of Chad Michael Murray. It was a really sweet movie, and I always liked Hilary Duff.''' ,'''There's an indie movie I did called 'Fat Kid Rules the World,' which was based on a teen book, and it's a fabulous story, and hopefully it'll go to theaters because it is an amazing story.''' ,]
