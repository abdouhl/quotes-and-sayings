- If you believe you can make a difference, then you will make a difference. Believe in yourself, your family and your community and you will win.
- Gaining my education from practical experience certainly benefited me. If I had gone on to be a lawyer, my life wouldn't have been anywhere near as interesting.
- I'd rather have a pencil and paper and do all my own calculations rather than rely on a machine. And I'll do most calculations in double digit multiples as quick as the machine.
- If you give people peanuts, you get monkeys. So if you want good people that are highly qualified, make the amount of money available for them to go out and do the job.
- Life isn't about algebra and geometry. Learning by making mistakes and not duplicating them is what life is about.
- Three score and, and ten has always been something that I never thought I'd make. So when I made it, I wanted to celebrate it and I did.
- One of the nicest things about receiving the accolade of Australia is that, previously, the knighthood was historically for what was termed 'the establishment.' Now, this is an accolade for somebody who comes from a working-class background. Someone whose father was a truck driver and decided to buy a truck.
- My father was a truck driver. That's where it all started, and academically I was a disaster at school. My cousin got his name on the honour board; I, at Melbourne High School, I carved mine on the desk.
- I started ice-skating when I was about 12 or 13 and I was selected in the Australian team for ice hockey. I met my wife at St Moritz Ice Skating about 1955.
- Personal relationships are always the key to good business. You can buy networking; you can't buy friendships.
- The old man sold beer after hours on weekends. And that was something that he probably did to top up his earnings as a truck driver. Mum was the traditional housewife. Loving, caring, sharing - always the keynotes of the family.
- Basically as a working class boy I understand when there's not enough money to put food on the table and not knowing where the next dollar comes in from. When you've been in that environment as a child, you never lose it.
- At Linfox we have zero tolerance. If any alcohol or drugs are found in any drivers' blood, they are instantly dismissed.
- Anybody I grew up with in this area - they're still a mate. Lots of people in the Prahran area gave me my first go. Sold me my trucks on... I don't know, 100 deposit and 100 a month. Without the support of those guys, you'd still sort of be driving a truck.
- Initially, I used to cart coke from the West Melbourne Gasworks -12 tonne a day, 150-pound sacks. I'd come home looking like Al Jolson at the end of the day - white teeth, black face... A good hard day's work.
- I was a careless Protestant, my wife was a good Catholic, and we had six kids in seven years and I'd endorse that to everyone.
- People in business generally have a responsibility to the community. They have to put back into the community from which they take. I think I've adopted that all through my life. Caring and sharing are two major fundamentals of life.
- To start your working life after you've graduated from school and university, it takes you a long time to get started in the real world. Today, kids are not out into the workforce until 27 or 30 years of age. By the time I was 30, I had six kids and 60 trucks.
- I don't think there's any real motivation for somebody to be a truck driver. Mine was simple; dad was a truck driver, I wanted to own one.
