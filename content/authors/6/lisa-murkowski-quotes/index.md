quotes = ['''We owe it to ourselves to keep healthy this marvelous world we've been given.''' ,'''I was returned to the Senate by the people of Alaska, and I have an obligation to all of them - it's not an obligation to my party; it's an obligation to Alaskans.''' ,'''I wish that I could tell you that I have a season ski pass, but I have had to give that up since I've been in the Senate.''' ,'''I am still a Republican. I have not changed that.''' ,'''So much of what we do addresses the issues that are associated with climate change, whether it's working to reduce emissions, whether it's working to nail down our renewables, whether it's ensuring great efficiency in accessing all of our energy sources.''' ,'''I am not looking for a pound of flesh from Sally Jewell.''' ,'''Statutory authority to improve fuel economy has existed for 35 years at the Transportation Department, and it still exists today.''' ,'''Freedom comes from strength and self-reliance.''' ,'''I believe it is important that Title X organizations continue to receive funding.''' ,'''I'm not a gym rat. I've got a gym membership, but my schedule is so crazy I just can't keep it regular.''' ,'''I am not one of those who wants Obama to fail. If he does well, that means the country's doing well.''' ,'''Imagine that foreign development is not done to our standards and a spill occurs. Neither geology nor ocean currents will respect our national boundaries.''' ,'''I will be sent back to Washington, D.C., with the grace of God and all the Alaskan voters out there because all Alaskans have asked me to go back and continue my service.''' ,'''I don't fit neatly into anybody's political boxes, and I think that sometimes disturbs people. But I don't think most Alaskans fit neatly into the Republican box or the Democratic box. They don't think of themselves that way.''' ,'''In order to represent the state, you've got to be in the state.''' ,'''I will do everything, everything in my power, for as long as I am here, to enable the people of King Cove to receive proper emergency access that the rest of us take for granted.''' ,'''A lot of the basic research that helped us figure out fracking came from the federal government.''' ,'''I think that the ability to export our abundant resources of LNG is good for us and quite honestly helps with the balance-of-trade issue. Japan would love to see LNG coming from its friend and closest ally, the United States.''' ,'''Any efforts or opportunity to expand the civil bonds and rights to anyone that wants to build a stable, happy household should be promoted.''' ,'''It is fundamentally important in our system of government that every American be given the opportunity to vote, regardless of who they are, where they live, and what their race or national origin may be.''' ,'''I don't pass the Tea Party's purity test.''' ,'''I have nothing against President McKinley whatsoever, but I would rather have this peak be called by the name it has gone by for centuries by Alaskans than a man who never set foot in our state. This is the tallest mountain in North America, and we deserve to have this Alaskan landmark bear an Alaskan name.''' ,'''I've supported the repeal of ObamaCare.''' ,'''There are many outsiders that actively try to halt every natural resource development project in Alaska. Many of these same people have never even been to Alaska, yet they claim to know what's best for us.''' ,'''Think about how our country was built. The greatness came from our diversity; the greatness came from individuals with different perspectives coming together.''' ,'''How we move forward with a level of R&D support that will be meaningful allows us to really build on and enhance our energy opportunities in this country.''' ,'''We can write the book on how to run a successful write-in campaign for the United States Senate.''' ,'''With the notion of marriage - an exclusive, emotional, binding 'til death do you part' tie - becoming more and more an exception to the rule given a rise in cohabitation and high rates of divorce, why should the federal government be telling adults who love one another that they cannot get married simply because they happen to be gay?''' ,'''We need to face it, as a nation we have a reliance on petroleum.''' ,'''I was advised by my assistant that the women of the Senate don't do potlucks. To which I responded, 'Of course we do.'''' ,'''We fail to boost our offshore production at our own expense.''' ,'''I'm a firm believer that if you put together a good product that is just good policy, that is embraced by both sides so that it is seen as politically advantageous to the Republicans or Democrats, that even in this very polarized partisan world that you can advance legislation. I have to believe that, or I wouldn't want to get up every morning.''' ,'''What I am delivering to Alaska is a future that holds hope and opportunity for jobs, for people in this state.''' ,'''We still have billions of barrels in Alaska that sit untapped. There are abundant reserves offshore in the lower 48.''' ,'''What I look at is, do you represent the values of the state of Alaska? Do you represent the people here in terms of what it is that they need, they hope for, what they hope for their future? And Joe Miller simply does not represent that.''' ,'''Our hunting areas are the grocery store.''' ,'''I want to support John Boehner in any way that I can, but we need to be pragmatic.''' ,'''Like the majority of Alaskans, I supported a constitutional amendment in 1998 defining marriage as only between a man and a woman, but my thinking has evolved as America has witnessed a clear cultural shift.''' ,'''We've been helping you out in Alaska in considerable ways, and you're walking away from the responsibility, and we're not going to allow that.''' ,'''I'm working for my state first.''' ,'''It doesn't make sense to argue about how much global warming is caused by man - whether it's 5 percent or 50 percent.''' ,'''The more traditional fuel sources we have relied on as a nation - coal, oil, and natural gas - I'm hoping they can allow us the financial springboard to move to the next generation of energy sources: renewables and alternatives.''' ,'''I have nice watches. I don't set them.''' ,'''I think there are a lot of outside interests that would like to see Sarah Palin in some form of elected office. Most in Alaska recognize our former governor is really not involved in or engaged in the state anymore, that she's moved to other interests.''' ,'''I am not here as my party's nominee. I am unique among the 100 senators in that regard.''' ,'''America's neighbors are not drilling for fun or for sport; they've chosen to proceed to create new jobs, generate new revenues, and increase the energy supply and prosperity of their citizens.''' ,'''I think Alaskans expect me to think, to think about them and do the right thing for them.''' ,'''People think that every day we pass monumental legislation. Oftentimes, the most important thing that you have done that day is help a family with a visa.''' ,'''Alaskans deserve a fighter in the United States Senate who will always stand up for Alaska, who understands our great potential, who has the experience, respect and seniority to accomplish that. I am that senator.''' ,'''It's much more powerful to say I'm working to reduce spending, deal with our nation's deficit, push back on the federal government, and give specifics for that rather than just say, 'I'm a conservative.'''' ,'''We talk a lot in Congress about how we're going to encourage more development in renewables, and we put in place a subsidy that's good for two years. Then Congress argues and bickers over whether or not we're going to extend it. As a consequence, nothing happens because we've put so much uncertainty into the prospect of these subsidies.''' ,'''We don't have time as a nation to spend all of what we do blocking.''' ,'''I believe when there are so many forces pulling our society apart, we need more commitment to marriage, not less.''' ,'''I'm not - I'm not going to define people by labels: who's a real Republican, who's not a real Republican.''' ,'''For eight years, I've served on the Indian Affairs committee, two years as the ranking member. I've been on that committee since Day One. I will stay on the committee for as long as I'm in the Senate because of my commitment to making a difference for Alaska Natives.''' ,'''I'm not afraid to spend money on the R&D that's really going to move us to a cleaner energy source that I think is so much the answer to the issues of environmental responsibility and climate change.''' ,'''You shouldn't say, 'Well, we cannot go there,' before we even had the conversation.''' ,'''Whether it was his ability to turn around the Massachusetts economy or turn around businesses in the private sector, Mitt Romney has demonstrated the leadership that we need in the White House to get the country on the right track.''' ,'''Mitt Romney understands the importance of Alaska as a leader in our country's energy production and I look forward to working with him on such an important economic and national security matter.''' ,'''What could be more important to the pursuit of happiness than the right to choose your spouse without asking a Washington politician for permission?''' ,'''When you put in place regulations that are so burdensome, so tough, so much so that they cripple your economy, we then don't have the resources to invest in technologies that are going to make that difference, because it's just going to shut everything down. That's not going to help us as an economy.''' ,'''You've got to move us to these technologies that allow us to get to the clean-energy source. If we can't work to reduce the cost, you're not going to see them implemented unless there is a path of unlimited subsidies, and that's not doable, either. We can kick-start the research process, but we have to do that from a position of economic strength.''' ,'''The war against terrorism is one we must win.''' ,'''I am working for Alaska's best interests.''' ,'''We do not have the transportation infrastructure that all you in the lower 48 have. We don't have energy grids that tie us in.''' ,'''Alaskans need some certainty and clarity over how the Pebble Partnership intends to proceed. I understand the complexity of a project like this, and I appreciate the investments that have been made in Alaska already. But a reliable timeline has been missing, and I hope that the companies will provide one soon.''' ,'''I have never once asked Alaskans to like how I got this job.''' ,'''When you think about the children, one of the things that I'm quite concerned about - and I've heard it expressed by others - is trying to find how we can build better accountability, work to provide a level of education that prepares our children for the future.''' ,'''I did not believe and I do not believe that Planned Parenthood should be defunded.''' ,'''Scott McAdams is a nice guy, but I don't know that most Alaskans believe that he's electable.''' ,'''I'm all about accessing our resources; I'm all about those jobs. But I want to make sure I'm not expensing one for the other.''' ,'''What people unfortunately relate to when they think of Alaska oil was when the Exxon Valdez went aground because of a captain that was drunk. But when you look to how we have been safely producing and moving Alaska's oil for decades, it is a track record that is enviable.''' ,'''Keep in mind, our demographics of our state, how it breaks down in terms of political affiliation: over half the people in this state chose not to align themselves with any party at all.''' ,'''If there's anybody who is recognized as the one guy who has stymied Alaskan development, it's Bill Clinton.''' ,'''I do believe that Planned Parenthood provides vital services to those in need and disagree with its funding cuts contained in the H.R. 1 package.''' ,'''One thing that Alaskans clearly appreciate is seniority.''' ,'''I'm not a quitter - never have been.''' ,'''The Voting Rights Act of 1965 brought an end to the ugly Jim Crow period in American history.''' ,'''I still wear my write-in wristband. It used to be plastic, but my husband turned it into gold.''' ,'''I have voted in support of efforts in the Senate to enact a Constitutional amendment that would have limited marriage to one man and one woman only.''' ,'''I think it's fair to say that women have a different level of intuitiveness that allows them to perhaps handle situations a little bit different.''' ,'''I look at what we have - our traditional natural resource base - as helping move us to that cleaner, more diverse energy supply.''' ,'''I don't buy into this, 'Oh, poor us. We've got tough budget problems.'''' ,'''Seniority actually means something in the Senate.''' ,'''We can sit between active drilling operations in neighboring countries, complaining that it's too risky to develop our own resources while the world around us does exactly that.''' ,'''The thought of losing Ted Stevens, a man who was known to business and community leaders, Native chiefs and everyday Alaskans as Uncle Ted, is too difficult to fathom. He truly was the greatest of the Greatest Generation.''' ,'''We have so many issues in this country to focus on that worry us, that I question why there is such focus on the simple right of people to love whom they will.''' ,'''I look at my cell phone to see what time it is where I am, and then you behave accordingly. If people are eating, it must be time to eat.''' ,'''I believe that, as Americans, our freedoms come from God and not government, and include the rights enumerated in the Declaration of Independence: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.''' ,'''From 2002-2008, Planned Parenthood received $342 million in federal taxpayer money through Title X funding alone. With these funds, Planned Parenthood has provided women throughout the U.S. with important family planning and contraceptive services as well as screening for breast and cervical cancers for low-income women.''' ,'''There are times when you need to pitch a fit and other times when you need to apply Catholic guilt, and it's just figuring out which is the most appropriate approach and then implementing it.''' ,'''What you get when you elect Lisa Murkowski is you get somebody who builds on that legacy that Ted Stevens built for our state for 40 years that continues on that path, that trajectory, to helping a young state like Alaska build us out.''' ,'''I believe marriages should be legally defined as between one man and one woman.''' ,'''I've got two young sons who, when I ask them and their friends how they feel about gay marriage, kinda give me one of those looks like, 'Gosh, Mom, why are you even asking that question?'''' ,'''If there is one belief that unifies most Alaskans - our true north - it is less government and more freedom. We don't want the government in our pockets or our bedrooms; we certainly don't need it in our families.''' ,'''To most Alaskans, Clinton is remembered as being the one individual who has shut Alaska down by vetoing ANWR when we successfully moved it through the Congress.''' ,'''I've been working to make sure that we've got adequate transportation. I've been working to make sure that we can afford energy within our villages and in our communities.''' ,]
