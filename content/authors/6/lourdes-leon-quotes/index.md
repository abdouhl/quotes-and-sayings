- As you probably know, this woman I like to call my mother went on tour for her 'MDNA' album. As a summer job, I decided to work in the wardrobe department. All of my friends were getting summer jobs, and I wanted one, too. Mine was a little unconventional but still a great experience and a lot of fun.
- My mom doesn't fit into my shoes, so sucks for her!
- I have a lot of people judging my every move. It's important for me to not let it rule my life.
- I love when someone doesn't pretend to be someone they are not.
- I used to look at the outfits that I wore when I was 11, and I was like, 'That's really ugly.' I mean, I just thought I was the coolest kid ever and actually wasn't.

- My mom has helped me so much. She has great style, and she's an amazing dresser.
- My mom definitely inspires me. She's just crazy when it comes to her fashion sense.
