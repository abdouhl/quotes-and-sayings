quotes = ['''My parents don't press it but, you know, they're into good grades.''' ,'''For me, it was a choice between band and drama - and I hated the band teacher.''' ,'''I was a painfully shy person in my pre-acting days.''' ,'''My character Milly in 'The Boy Who Could Fly' was a very strong part. There were dramatic moments, and there were humorous moments, too. The whole story with Eric Underwood's character was just wonderful, and the messages behind the script were very important to me.''' ,'''Soaps have a schedule where you have to be done in 15 minutes. With an hour show, there's no way to get off schedule. On a movie, it's a lot easier to go back and reshoot scenes. I wasn't used to that at all... taking the time to really make each scene as good as it can be, which you can't do on soaps.''' ,]
