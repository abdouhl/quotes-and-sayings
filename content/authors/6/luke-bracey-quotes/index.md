- No one I knew in Sydney was thinking about how they might come to America and become a movie star. That would be considered delusions of grandeur. My parents were supportive, though. They just told me to keep at it as long as I was having fun.
- At the end of the day, it is just a movie, and we should remember that we're doing it for the audience, and we should have fun doing it. If we have fun doing it, it will come across on the screen.
- I thought I'd be a professional rugby player or go to university and get some degree in construction.
- I like to think of myself as a romantic person!
- I grew up surfing. My dad probably put me on a surfboard before I could walk.
- No, 'Point Break' for me - growing up on the beaches of Sydney as a surfer, it was kind of the movie that we watched every week. For me to be Johnny Utah, I'm beside myself.
- I'm really into the idea of telling stories. Everyone needs stories. Everyone needs to escape every once in a while.
- You can make movies and not particularly get along with the people you're working with but, when they say 'Action,' your job is to make it look like you're in love.
- 'Point Break' is a movie that I and all of my friends grew up loving, watching all the time, quoting, living and being.
- I wake up every day and look at my own ugly mug in the mirror and don't think twice about it. The fact that other people might want to look at me still feels funny. It's flattering, but funny.
- I moved to Los Angeles when I was about 20, all by myself. It was exciting. I had this moment when I felt like I needed to put on my big-boy pants and just make that leap to see what would happen.
- I've still got to go and see the world, but I will come back to Australia in the end, when I have my family, in many moons to come.
- I see similarities in the sports I played growing up in the sense of how I tackle a role when I get a job. A lot of effort goes in on an individual basis. There is a lot of time spent by yourself working on your craft and what you have to do. But, at the end of the day, you're there to serve the movie just like you would the rugby team.
- I remember my first night in L.A. I was sitting outside, looking out at the city and thinking, 'I don't know anyone.' I just approached it as a big adventure. I still think of it that way.
- My poor mother. Every time I get a job, she asks, 'Am I gonna have to watch you kiss someone again in this one?' and I say, 'You're probably gonna have to watch me kiss someone in most of them, Mom.'
- With action movies, that's just fun stuff for me. That's me being a kid again. Same with 'The Best of Me' and these romantic dramas. It's such a freedom from reality and social constructions. You get to just have fun and play and be in a movie.
