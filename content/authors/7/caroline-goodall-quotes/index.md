quotes = ['''I have a real problem with watching movies where I see this perfect woman who is married to the man in question, who has a perfect life, who has perfect hair, perfect clothes, and doesn't give you any of the kind of reality that you're used to.''' ,'''A lot of actresses feel the pressure to constantly look good, to constantly show how well-toned every inch of their bodies are and how much they've been to the gym, not necessarily to do justice to the role they're in, but to point out to the producers out there, 'Hey, look what I've got - remember me for your next project.'''' ,'''The influence of Steven Spielberg to my career is unquantifiable. Every day on the set with him is a master class in filmmaking.''' ,'''I'm in kind of a strange position - I have a strong Australian career and a strong British career.
