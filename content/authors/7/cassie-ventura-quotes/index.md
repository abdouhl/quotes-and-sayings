- I'm just a laid-back person.
- I never feel like I've been pushed towards a certain thing, but now, at 26, I do feel like I have integrity over my output, you know? There's a fine line between saying, 'You can't tell me what I can and can't do,' and taking on board people's opinions.
- It would be awesome to stay popular, but if I was only an underground artist, I would be okay with that.
- I've been auditioning for a few movies here and there. I don't want anything to get in the way of the music any more than it has. It hasn't really gotten in the way; I've been doing two things at once.
- My mother is black and my father is Filipino. I got the best of both worlds.
- I'm from Connecticut. My Mom is an army brat, and my Dad is a navy brat. My childhood was fun. My parents are still together. My childhood was pretty carefree.
- I tried a little of everything when I was little. I tried karate, I tried ballet, I tried piano lessons and singing lessons... I was a pretty normal kid, for the most part.
- I'm a perfectionist and, when it comes to people I want to work with, I have changed my mind, like, millions of times.
- I did musical theater, and I did dancing for what it was at the performing arts high school that I went to. I went to a school where I was there on a scholarship. So I think when you're on a scholarship, you always work a tad harder, or you want to work a tad harder than the next person.
- There's a fine line between saying, 'You can't tell me what I can and can't do,' and taking on board people's opinions.
