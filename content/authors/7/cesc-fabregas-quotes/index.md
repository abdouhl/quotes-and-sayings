- I think you have to be grateful to those who have helped you.
- My mum has always said I am too hard on myself. But I have always been like that and it has always helped me. After matches I focus only on what I did wrong. Never what I did well.
- I've had a couple of years where injuries have not let me develop in the way I wanted. When I was 21, after the European Championship, I had more injuries. Everything has been less continuous and it has cost me more progress. Continuity is what got me where I am.
- I want to play for Arsenal. When you see football all around the world, you see very few teams who play the way that we play. I just enjoy it. I feel it is my home now.
- You have to fight for your dream, but you also have to feel fortunate for what you have.
- If one day I leave Arsenal, I will never sign for another English team. Quite sure.
