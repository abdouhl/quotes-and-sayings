Perseverence is the key.''' ,'''I'd like to play an alien, like from 'Starman' or 'K-PAX,' where it's human. I think I'm destined to play an alien.''' ,'''I've never really been a genre fan. I never grew up reading comic books or was a horror buff.''' ,'''I'm a fan of James Frain's work, especially in 'True Blood.' He was so awesome in that show.''' ,'''I sometimes like to watch a good, dark, disturbing movie.''' ,'''I love Jeff Bridges. You can never go wrong with that guy. I hope to work with him one day.''' ,'''Filming movies and TV are vastly different. Film is more of slower pace. You usually have more time to develop characters, and it sometimes takes up to 3 months to film one movie. Sometimes you'll spend half the day filming one scene. TV moves much faster. It takes about 10 days to film an episode.''' ,]
