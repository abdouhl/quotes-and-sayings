- Each work seems to give me the most trouble at the time I'm working on it.

- Every man who has shown the world the way to beauty, to true culture, has been a rebel, a 'universal' without patriotism, without home, who has found his people everywhere.
- But today we become aware of other readings of the human experience very quickly because of the media and the speed with which people travel the planet.
- There is in my work a very strong religious foreground and background. In the later work some of that tends to diminish, but it's certainly present in the early work.

- As a species we are always hungry for new knowledge.
- It is impossible to fuse totally with a culture for which you feel a measure of antagonism.
- I'm constantly revising. Once the book is written and typed, I go through the entire draft again.
- It is inconceivable to me that a million or three million or half a million human beings will think and feel precisely the same way on any single subject.
- A book is sent out into the world, and there is no way of fully anticipating the responses it will elicit. Consider the responses called forth by the Bible, Homer, Shakespeare - let alone contemporary poetry or a modern novel.
- What I have in advance are people I want to write about and a problem or problems that I see those people encountering and that I want to explore - it all proceeds sentence by sentence, paragraph by paragraph, and scene by scene.
- I get up around 6:30. I work from about 8:00 to 1:00, take a break for lunch, work again until about 5:00, and then go for a long walk and have dinner. Then, if my wife and I have no previous plans, we decide what to do for the evening.
- In other words, Judaism is not Calvinism.
- I don't work on my Sabbath. I write five-and-a-half or six days a week.
- Come, let us have some tea and continue to talk about happy things.
- Two hundred or more years ago most people on the planet were never aware of any reality other than the one into which they were brought up.
- Well, one hopes that if you're really related to the core of your particular culture, you have profound commitments to it, and that you are aware of how much you can strain it before you do violence to its essential nature.
- I'm not altogether certain that a fundamentalism of necessity has to argue that it is the only reading of the human experience in order to stay alive.
- If I had a plot that was all set in advance, why would I want go through the agony of writing the novel? A novel is a kind of exploration and discovery, for me at any rate.
- To the extent that I come from a deeply religious tradition and have been contending with those beginnings all of my life - that constitutes the subject of much of my early fiction.
- Well, in The Chosen, Danny Saunders, from the heart of his religious reading of the world, encounters an element in the very heart of the secular readings of the world - Freudian psychoanalytic theory.

- I think most serious writers, certainly in the modern period, use their own lives or the lives of people close to them or lives they have heard about as the raw material for their creativity.
- I think that to a very great extent we are partners with the divine in this enterprise called history. That is an ongoing relationship, and there is absolutely no guarantee that things will automatically work out to our best advantage.
