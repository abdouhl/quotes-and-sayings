quotes = ['''I am not vegan, but I am obviously looking into all of these things.''' ,'''I think we always need to see the positive.''' ,'''It is vitally important for me to concentrate on myself, on the work that I have to do on the track and off it with the engineers, without really thinking about what people are expecting from me on the outside.''' ,'''I think I am my own biggest critic, yeah.''' ,'''My father, well he helped me with everything. From the start he was my biggest supporter and taught me a lot about his experience as a driver.''' ,'''We need to keep working and I am pretty sure the results will come.''' ,'''Yes, there will be situations when you may need to be a little selfish, but it is better to find the right balance.''' ,'''Since I was a child I've been looking up to Formula One. Dreaming to be a Formula One driver.''' ,'''I analyse everything I do and when I see something I don't like I try to find the solution and that's why I'm so hard on myself.''' ,'''Twitch is something I never thought I'd enjoy and I never saw myself doing. But actually I really enjoyed it. For the people that follow me, I think it's the closest you can get to the real me.''' ,'''He's extremely clever and I learn always so much when I fight with Lewis. He always knows exactly what you are going to do next with his experience, and that's what makes him so good on track with the battles. He's not very aggressive, always very correct, but always very good to anticipate what you are going to do.''' ,'''We need to keep working very hard.''' ,'''At a track, it's different, there's pressure, things like this, so to be yourself is a bit different.''' ,'''My dream as a child was being a world champion.''' ,'''As soon as I signed with Ferrari it was clear to me that people expected big performances from me. Even though people were realistic enough to see that I was only starting my second season and that I still had a lot to learn.''' ,'''The Sochi circuit can be challenging, featuring a combination of high speed straights and lots of corners, especially in the last sector.''' ,'''Jules Bianchi was my racing godfather, and he spoke a lot to Ferrari about me.''' ,'''All simulators are going to be different compared to reality, that's how I see it.''' ,'''I analyse everything I do to see if I can do better, that's how I grew over the years.''' ,'''I've always been very hard on myself, it's the way that works with me.''' ,'''Obviously being third in the Formula 1 world championship would be crazy.''' ,'''The atmosphere in Sochi is unusual, in that we are surrounded by the Olympic complex. It is special to compete at a location that has played such a big part in international sporting history, which gives this place a unique feeling.''' ,'''At the beginning, I didn't want to arrive at a big team like Ferrari and say: 'Ok, I want the car like this' - I just wanted to try and adapt to the car and then see if I wanted to make some changes.''' ,'''Certainly driving a Ferrari is, at the same time, a dream come true, a huge responsibility and a great honor.''' ,'''I would love to drive a MotoGP but I'm not sure Ferrari agrees.''' ,'''Nobody believes me, but to be honest the pressure is not something that I feel.''' ,'''I wake up in the morning thinking about victory, I go to sleep thinking about victory, so sometimes it might be hard. But I need to control myself more and, how can I say it politely? Just shut up instead of speaking on the radio.''' ,'''Of course, the cars are getting safer and safer but, when you are going at 340km/h, it can never be safe. This I knew from the start.''' ,'''That first victory, before you get to it, it always seems so far ahead. You're not sure whether you can make it or not.

In the car I want to give my best. It is passion, when you are passionate about something you give everything.

It changes you forever.''' ,'''In the car it is really good to have a killer instinct where you need to be aggressive.''' ,'''I just need to give the best of myself and work on myself.''' ,'''At the end of the day, it is always better to be a team player.''' ,'''I did not have the simulator for a long time but now I have it I am playing quite a lot - probably five hours a day. I am training to try to be competitive, and everything we do we want to be competitive as drivers.''' ,'''I don't like to hide the errors I make. Any time I'm doing a mistake, I'm just saying it.''' ,'''I just fully focus on myself and the job I do in the car and then I think the results will come.''' ,'''I haven't got any friends on the track when I have my helmet on but whenever I take it off, I am a normal person at the end.''' ,'''Anyone who has the chance to drive for Ferrari will drive for Ferrari.''' ,'''The red car, even before I knew it was called Ferrari, was my obsession.''' ,'''I don't really feel pressure.''' ,'''Every time a young driver comes into F1, the finger's pointed at him over his age.

Here from Formula 2 to Formula 1, it's a huge step on driving because we have nearly 400 BHP more, with a lot more downforce. So it's a completely different car.''' ,'''I love skiing.''' ,'''Formula 1 is such a big jump from Formula 2, and there are so many new things that you need to learn.''' ,'''As team-mates, it is difficult to act as a mentor.''' ,'''I rarely focus on the result only just because I think if I work well the results will come and if we work well as a team the results will come.''' ,'''I've done this in karting, to do one track in one way and then do it the other way.''' ,'''With less and less races people will want to take more risks.''' ,'''I always set the bar very high, not in terms of results but most in terms of preparation and focusing on the job there is to do in the car.''' ,'''I get on well with Italians. Which makes things easier when I meet, for example, my future mechanics at Ferrari.''' ,'''Before arriving at Ferrari, I had no idea how important it is for a Formula 1 team to be successful to have a successful relationship with their fuel and lubricants partner.''' ,'''When I think about it, it is quite crazy to race against people like Fernando Alonso, when I remember watching him from the balcony in Monaco.''' ,'''Every time you go back to winning, or to the good results, you take back the confidence in yourself and you feel a lot better.''' ,'''I'm not someone that always feels confident about himself.''' ,'''If you have one driver who only cares about himself then it's not great.''' ,'''To grow you must understand and admit your mistakes, it is an approach that works for me, it is not necessarily the same for everyone.''' ,'''Experience is always a plus, but I believe if you are good enough for an F1 seat, you are good enough from the year you arrive in F1.''' ,'''The Spa-Francorchamps circuit has a special place in my heart.''' ,'''There will always be some corners which are challenging and more dangerous than others.''' ,'''My mental strength was definitely a weakness back in the karting days, and I've worked hard on that to be as ready as possible for whenever I had the chance in F1.''' ,'''I like the danger, I like the adrenaline and I need it to race.''' ,'''It is a dream since a child to drive for the red cars.''' ,'''In Formula One nothing is easy, but I can feel I'm taking the right steps, that I'm working in the proper way.''' ,'''My ambition is to one day be in Formula 1 and hopefully become world champion.''' ,'''You cannot deliver to your maximum if you're thinking 'if I do an error, it might close a door to somewhere' or whatever.''' ,'''F1 always feels unreal until you arrive and get your first seat.''' ,'''I know it is a dangerous sport but this is something I like.''' ,'''The moment I prefer is the moment I put on the helmet, that everyone is leaving the pit lane, that I'm alone with the car and there it feels good. You don't have any feelings anymore; it's just racing and this I enjoy.''' ,'''It's very important for me to focus on myself, on the job I have to do on and off the track with the engineers without really thinking about what people expect of me off the track.''' ,'''Being honest with myself is something I like. I am happy that I don't make excuses when I make a mistake. This is a good way to improve in the fastest way.''' ,'''From the beginning when you go into this sport, you know how dangerous it is. It will never be a safe sport.''' ,'''I will respect Ferrari's decision for whoever is next to me and at the end it's my job to adapt to the person next to me and you can always learn from whoever is your team mate.''' ,'''I did not expect to have, at the end of my first season, seven poles and two wins. This is crazy. I did not expect it.''' ,'''F1 weekends are full of things and any time that you have five minutes, you need to use it as well as possible to calm down.''' ,'''I think it would be very exciting to do a track like Silverstone the other way around, to arrive so quick in Becketts and then Maggotts would be very exciting.''' ,'''It will always remain a dangerous sport.''' ,'''Somehow when I am at the racetrack, I don't really realise what is happening and I just focus on the job.''' ,'''At first, when I arrived at Ferrari, I was very intimidated by all the people there, by Ferrari itsel. This name is the biggest in motorsports.''' ,]
