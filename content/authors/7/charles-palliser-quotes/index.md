I thought it would be better to lull the reader into thinking that is the way it would work, but then not to do that.''' ,'''Living with my grandmother in Bath, I sort of thought I was living in the 19th century. My grandmother was someone who, in a way, was rather defiantly trying to live a pre-World War I existence.''' ,'''For me, it would be pointless to write a novel that I knew I could complete within a specific length of time. I could do that only by repeating something I had done before, and I've never wanted to do that.''' ,'''Victorian values meant brutalizing people who were often poor.''' ,'''To make it interesting and worth doing, writing a novel has to be a leap into the unknown. I have to be unsure if I can write it; otherwise, I won't want to.''' ,'''I'm quite intrigued by the notion of a book that is completely self-contained but related to another book.
