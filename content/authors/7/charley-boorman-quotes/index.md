- Any trip is good. Any bike trip is better!
- If you say to people, 'I'm off to Papa New Guinea,' you'll often get a bad reaction - usually from people who've never been there. There's this fear of the unknown. And 99% of the time, you end up surprised - it rekindles your faith in humanity.

- In places such as Kazakhstan and Mongolia people depend on each other a lot more.

- The fundamental thing for anybody, any relationship or any expedition or anything is communication.
- We have a Mercedes Viano, which is a sort of posh people carrier. I told my wife I bought it for the kids, but the real reason is that I can put my dirt bikes and a mattress in the back, then get out of London for the weekend.

- The experience of riding an electric bike is very different. Because there was no engine noise and no big vibration coming from the bike, it wasn't as stressful.
- I'm amazed how unable I am to deal with the demands that are made on me as an actor. Not the one I enjoy, which is standing in front of a camera or onstage pretending to be someone else but everything else that comes with it.
- You get sentimental on the road. I'd see a horse with its foal and a tear would come to my eye.
- Excalibur' was a quest for my father. I remember it was manic on the film set. And we had these massive castle sets. I think my dad was under tremendous pressure making the movie because there was so much going on. I remember it was a hard one to make - a lot of stress and strain.
- My ideal holiday would be to spend the first week doing lots of fun stuff, then to spend the second week relaxing on a beach.
- I think it's really important for people to have a passion... a hobby... riding horses or climbing or riding motorcycles or whatever it is. It's very good for the soul. And if you can find a soulmate with whom you can share similar experiences with... one who enjoys them as much as you do, then it's kind of a match made in heaven really.
- He was an amazing actor and could mimic anybody's voice. My sister Katrine was walking past one day and could hear our dad shouting and thought, 'God, I won't go in that room!' but realised it was Nicol Williamson mimicking my father's voice perfectly.
