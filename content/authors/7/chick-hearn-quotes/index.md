quotes = ['''Radio is the art form of sports casting. If you're any good, you can do a great job on radio.''' ,'''My work is a love for me; I'd do it for free, but don't tell my bosses.''' ,'''I do something that I don't think anyone else does. I warm up before a game. Baseball and basketball players warm up, so why shouldn't the announcer warm up?''' ,'''Most people can't talk as fast as I do. I'm not proud of that. That's God-given.''' ,'''I've got to be right on top of the action, or else all those people watching the game will say, 'This guy's not very good.'''' ,'''Anybody who doesn't think I want the Lakers to win is a fool. But I'm no homer.''' ,'''I always like to pretend two things: one, I'm sitting in the seat beside you watching the game together. I'll say, 'Wasn't that a great shot? Boy, it sure was.' The other thing I do is pretend I'm talking to people who are non-sighted. I try to create a word picture. I get more mail from blind people thanking me.''' ,'''You can't please everybody all the time, but you can please a majority.''' ,]
