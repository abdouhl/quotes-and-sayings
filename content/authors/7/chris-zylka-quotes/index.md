- I find myself to be the least intimidating person ever.
- Every great story leaves you questioning. If all of the questions are answered, and everything is resolved, it's boring. There's nothing to talk about afterwards.
- It's good to have butterflies. And they always go away. The camera starts rolling and they go away and it's all good.
- My career has gone in such a way that I've gotten to learn that, when you're working with a great storyteller, you don't ask questions; you just trust them.
- I am extremely passionate about what I do, and the happiest I am is when I'm on set working.
- I just look at the character and the arc of the character, and see if it's going to be challenging. We always want to challenge ourselves. That's the biggest thing that I look at. Is this going to be a challenge? Is this going to be something that I can try my best to create, that no one could see anyone else do?
- My favorite scary movie was always 'Halloween.' I love that there's hidden emotion underneath Michael Myers' psychotic behavior. Plus, he has the best mask, hands-down.
- I'm not one of those people that pretends he doesn't watch himself.
- I was always the misfit jock who was with people painting on walls.
- I get so antsy. When you're working, you're like, 'Oh my God, I'm so tired.' And then a hiatus starts, and you're off for three days, and you don't know what to do with yourself. You're never gonna have another job in your life, and you suck at acting. Your world comes tumbling down pretty quickly.
- I had never really thought about acting as art. You know, growing up in Youngstown, the Rust Belt of the world, it was always just a form of entertainment. Finally seeing it as an art form, I fell in love with it. So I moved out to California, never having visited before.
- You appreciate just being able to work because there are so many actors that aren't. You have to appreciate every single job just the same.
- Going from 'Shark Night' to 'Piranha,' a guy holding a fish on a stick in front of you that they're going to replace in post-production, it's a lot different than seeing this animatronic shark that, if you get caught up in the moment, looks, acts and you sometimes think could be real.
- It takes longevity to earn respect.
- Most people wouldn't guess, but I'm really into painting: acrylics and sometimes oils.
- My greatest fear is failure.
- The day Trump got elected, I got off social media.
- I was always a fan of Spider-Man and most superheroes. There aren't a whole lot of little boys out there that aren't.
- Bullies really bother me a lot. A lot, a lot.
- I always live by the idea that my favorite job is my next one. It doesn't really matter what the content is.
- It's just so much more fun to play bad than good. Plus it's just good to get that out of your system so it doesn't show up in your personal life.
- The difference between a regular camera and a 3D camera, for an actor, is really no different except that the turn-arounds are longer. It takes a lot longer to set up a shot because the cinematographer is really trying to set up a whole world, so it can't be more intricate and more beautiful to the viewers, in 3D.
- I actually saw 'Piranha 3DD' - God, it's so weird saying that - and it's actually really surprising. It's really good. It's funny; it's fun. And you actually want more when you see it.
- My mentor Jon Simmons introduced me to the Stanislavski system, which is so heavy on back-story. So you write and write and write these back stories about a character and then you throw it away. So then on set, if it doesn't come, then you didn't do your work.
- In a film you only get two hours to do this big arc and so you have to pick and choose your moments carefully, but with television you get to take your time and just take it episode by episode and discover new things.
- If you don't know there's something better out there, you don't realize that you have it bad.
- I'm an artist; I love everyone.
- Being able to be on set every single day and actually lead a movie was very humbling but so exciting at the same time.
- You can't really be picky and choosy for your first lead role.
- Everyone in the world knows 'Spider-Man.' And to be accepted into such a large franchise was overwhelming.
- I'm a huge walking oxymoron. People think they're going to get something that's a lot different from what they get.
