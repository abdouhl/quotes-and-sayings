quotes = ['''A Hamilton-Vettel combination, on paper, would look very attractive to any team. However, what you have to look at is the dynamics of any partnership like that and it's difficult to see how two sportsmen at the absolute top of their game could work in harmony under one roof.''' ,'''I think too often you see parts being taken from one engine to go onto another... That's been too much of a theme over the whole hybrid era, and that must compromise dyno time, that must compromise endurance running, and so on.''' ,'''Race drivers are fiercely competitive animals, and there is often a conflict between what is right for the team and what is right for the individual.''' ,'''When you win a Grand Prix, it's the culmination of everything coming together. Not just trackside, but behind the scenes.''' ,'''You can window-dress and promote a movie as much as you like but if the movie hasn't got substance and isn't an exciting movie, people won't watch it.''' ,'''I did a deal with my parents to take a year out before university at the end of 1992 to try and forge a career in motor sport. I still haven't gone. I left school at 18 and that was it.''' ,'''I am great believer that, if you put your mind to anything, you can achieve anything.''' ,'''Twenty races is a tough season. It's a long year.''' ,'''The drivers are the stars; the drivers are the heroes.''' ,'''The most encouraging thing is that with the management changes there have been at Renault, they are very open to accepting that there are issues and they need to improve.''' ,'''If the racing series does not exist for a year, then it disappears in its entirety. Teams that have been operating very close to the limit just wouldn't survive. They rely on racing to generate income and to fulfill their obligations to the promoter.''' ,'''Sport can change so quickly where confidence is such a big factor.''' ,'''It's a competitive business and obviously a lot of money is involved in the sport and the regulators sometimes have difficult decisions to make, but hopefully for the benefit of Formula 1 and all the fans across the world, we can move forwards into 2008 with all the focus on the race track rather than in the courtroom.''' ,'''There are no team orders within Red Bull Racing, other than that the drivers should race each other with respect.''' ,'''We're in a good position with the Red Bull juniors. When I look around at what other schemes there are, Red Bull has invested a huge amount in youth and should be commended for giving these guys the opportunity that might otherwise have gone missing.''' ,'''I think F1, ultimately, is man and machine at its absolute limit. It is modern day chariot racing.''' ,'''Winning is very addictive, that's why it's very hard when suddenly - boom - you are not the favorites any more.''' ,'''Red Bull have always been very good at nurturing young talent - Sebastian Vettel and Daniel Ricciardo are products of that - and it is important with Asian talent that people keep investing in it. There's a massive pool of people, for sure, and the next Sebastian Vettel is out there somewhere.''' ,'''I've grown up in motorsport since I was 12 or 13 years of age; I've never been on a management training course.''' ,'''I have a long-term contract with the team and have said many times that there is only one Bernie Ecclestone. What he has done for Formula One is incredible and in my opinion he is irreplaceable.''' ,'''You know, Theresa May, she's doing the best she can with not a great hand, a little bit like Chase Carey really.''' ,'''It's the fear of failure that drives all of us at Red Bull.''' ,'''I was 25 when I stopped racing, I loved the teamwork and I wanted to apply what I knew about it into building and running a team.''' ,'''I'd rather have a driver that was like that, that had that passion and that fire in his belly and you can channel that. The sport's crying out for more drivers like Max Verstappen.''' ,'''The Red Bull Ring is a ready-made facility, it can be ready in a very short period of time to fit the FIA's criteria.''' ,'''F1's ability to problem-solve is second to none and our ability to make rapid prototype parts is again second to none.''' ,'''I've always felt that age is just a number - it's not how old or how young you are, it's how you conduct yourself.''' ,'''As far as I'm concerned, I enjoy what I do, I enjoy the competition, working with a group of people to get the best out of them.''' ,'''I think it's a loss of energy to be worrying about other people's issues.''' ,'''I would hate to see the championship decided on grid penalties.''' ,'''There is always going to be competition from other countries and different venues who want to host a race, but the British GP is a must have.''' ,'''The roll out of a new car is always filled with great anticipation; it's almost like going back to school for a new school year.''' ,'''Personally, I would go back to V12s, which make a tremendous noise, and have open cockpits and make the drivers heroes again.''' ,'''The cap is a discussion about competitiveness, not about money. It's about trying to bring the top teams down to a level where the midfield teams feel they can compete. The reality is that whatever the level of spend there will always be teams that run at the front and teams that run at the back.''' ,'''I think winning becomes addictive.''' ,'''And I'd get back to the cars being physical challenges to drive - to tame the beast. The cars we have at the moment are fantastic bits of engineering, but it's a little too comfortable, a little too easy. I think I'd go back to making the driver a bigger variable.''' ,'''Exxon have done a very good job for us. Their difficulty and frustration has also been that as a customer we get very limited dyno time. But they were able to come up with a fuel that made the C-spec work, and we've managed to get that in the car and run that successfully, when the works team haven't been able to do that.''' ,'''For Infiniti, the global coverage that Formula One provides is second only to the Olympics.''' ,'''Drivers are not good at having nothing to do.''' ,'''It's always dangerous quoting numbers and expectations.''' ,'''Sport is escapism. Sport is a release.''' ,'''When you're at the top you're always going to be shot at.''' ,'''I think if a driver commits to a team it's like disappearing with another girlfriend half way through the year, it doesn't seem like the right thing to do.''' ,'''I think one thing Liberty finds frustrating is a lot of this business is conducted through the media. That's something they're not used to with American sport. There's that constant comparison of America sport and franchises verses Formula One - American sport works in America, it doesn't work globally.''' ,'''Red Bull has invested a huge amount in youth and should be commended.''' ,'''When you don't experience something for a long time you realize how much you love it and how much you miss it.''' ,'''Sixty points is massive, especially when you are racing a Mercedes with another 70 horsepower.''' ,'''Formula One is one of the biggest and most competitive sports in the world and our desire is to get back to be giving Mercedes a hard time and winning races and championships.''' ,'''Just taking the front wing and saying that will make racing better, it's quite a naive and ultimately expensive approach.''' ,'''The prospect of being able to run a race behind closed doors is absolutely feasible.''' ,'''What we expect from our drivers, as team mates, is that they show respect for each other and allow one another enough room on the race track.''' ,'''Red Bull is an energy drinks company operating a team in F1, of course it doesn't sit particularly well when you are competing against iconic brands like Ferrari and Mercedes. We are happy to be perceived as a bit of a maverick.''' ,'''There are no ultimatums for Renault other than we want to improve as quickly as we can.''' ,'''Formula 1 need to have a good look at itself. As a show, I think we need to put on a better show for the fans.''' ,'''Our target is to compete with Ferrari and Mercedes.''' ,'''Mercedes and Ferrari fear Red Bull more than any other team because they know the potency and capability that we have.''' ,'''You've got different governments and manufacturers saying, 'Oh, we'll be electric and autonomous by 2030 or whatever.' In my view Formula One is at a crossroads. What is its purpose? We have Formula E, and a lot of manufacturers are morphing into that area. But the emotion, the entertainment, the excitement of those cars just isn't there.''' ,'''I'm very much a people person.''' ,'''The costs in F1 are extremely high, it is down to the regulators to control those costs through having stable regulations, every time you change the rules, there is a huge cost involved.''' ,'''We get paid based on where we are in the Constructors' Championship so therefore we want the fastest and best drivers we can get in the car.''' ,'''We need to think out of the box rather than just going round and round, beating ourselves up about numbers.''' ,'''The competitor within craves to get going, to get racing.''' ,'''Obviously a decision was made to elevate both Jean-Eric Vergne and Daniel Ricciardo, who are two of the most exciting talents on the periphery of Formula 1, into race seats at Toro Rosso.''' ,'''The great thing about Daniel Ricciardo is you can't not like him, he's got a big smile, he loves what he does, he's a great personality.''' ,'''As has been the case with Sebastian Vettel, Daniil Kvyat, Daniel Ricciardo, Max Verstappen, we're always going to draw upon the talent pool we have.''' ,'''My focus has always been very much on what we're doing at Red Bull. We can't control what others do. It's not our business.''' ,'''It is unnatural for drivers and team members to be sitting on their hands when we would usually be racing.''' ,'''The main reason for our achievements is teamwork. It's quite simply the group of people that are here at Red Bull Racing and Red Bull Technology working as one unit.''' ,'''We want to be a works partner. Ferrari and Mercedes have their own works teams so where would you be in the pecking order if you're a customer?''' ,'''It's so important to come up with the right specification of cars - they need to be loud, they need to be fast.''' ,'''Our priority as a team is to finish first and second, irrelevant of the order.''' ,'''F1 is a very strong business and it's got enormous heritage.''' ,'''I never struggle for motivation, that's for sure. Motivation is something that burns within.''' ,'''Mercedes and Ferrari are working as one team these days. Sometimes it is difficult to tell which is which.''' ,'''We have a very long-standing relationship with Renault, we've won a lot of races with them.''' ,'''Nobody wants to lose Ferrari. And I don't think Ferrari can afford to lose Formula One.''' ,'''I have total admiration for the Renault guys in the garage that are working their socks off, week in, week out.''' ,'''I would put my money on both my drivers to win if it came down a streetfight.''' ,'''We want to run at the front, we want to be competitive and, in order to be competitive, we have to have a sensible power unit.''' ,'''We've always said that it doesn't say 'Daniel Ricciardo Racing' or 'Max Verstappen Racing' - it says Red Bull Racing.''' ,'''We have a very good relationship with Renault. They treat us with absolute parity to the works team, and there is a very good collaboration between Renault engineers and Red Bull Racing engineers.''' ,'''When I started there was Frank Williams, Flavio Briatore, Ron Dennis, Eddie Jordan and Peter Sauber round the table. These were entrepreneurial team owners, mavericks in some respects.''' ,'''I was always fascinated by speed... My father was always an enthusiast and once I found a passion in racing, I had something in common with him, so from my childhood onwards we spent a lot of time going to karting tracks and racing in the various categories.''' ,'''Times change, things move. F1 used to have customer cars years ago. You could buy a car from March or from Ferrari and go racing.''' ,'''Red Bull doesn't get the credit it deserves. Neither Buemi nor Alguersuari would have progressed through the junior ranks - let's not forget Alguersuari won the British Formula Three championship - without the support.''' ,'''We do the best we can and the great thing about this sport is every two weeks you know whether it is good enough or not.''' ,'''The number one driver in this team is the one who is ahead on the track, the rule is simple.''' ,'''We're very clear in the race that priority will be given to the lead car and more risk will be taken with the tail car. Sometimes that will work out, sometimes it won't, but it's very clear going into the event that those are the rules of engagement.''' ,]
