quotes = ['''We must build toward the future so that we are prepared to deal with the threats we will face at home and abroad and understand how those threats may be connected.''' ,'''Our mission is simple, but profound - to protect the American people and uphold the Constitution. That mission hasn't changed, and it won't change, not as long as I have anything to say about it.''' ,'''Our work in investigating the Oklahoma City bombing reflected some of the very best the FBI has to offer.''' ,'''The FBI is a field-based law enforcement organization, and the vast majority of our investigations should continue to be worked by our field offices.''' ,'''We can't eradicate hate, and we can't wish away evil. But we can continue to stand together on the side of the freedoms we all cherish.''' ,'''Criminal and terrorist threats are morphing beyond traditional actors and tactics. We still have to worry about things like an al-Qaida cell plotting a large-scale attack, but we also now have to worry increasingly about homegrown violent extremists radicalizing in the shadows.''' ,'''Technology has made life much easier for the good guy - there's no doubt.''' ,'''As the threat to harm the United States and U.S. interests evolves, we must adapt and confront these challenges, relying heavily on the strength of our federal, state, local, and international partnerships.''' ,'''The cyber threat has evolved dramatically since I left DOJ in 2005, partly just reflecting how much the digital world has itself evolved over that time. Back then, 'tweeting' was something only birds did.''' ,'''To be clear, we do not open investigations based on race, or ethnicity, or national origin. But when we open investigations into economic espionage, time and time again, they keep leading back to China.''' ,'''The FBI relies on FISA every day in national security investigations to prevent terrorists and foreign intelligence services from harming the United States.''' ,'''The FBI assesses HVEs are the greatest terrorism threat to the homeland.''' ,'''Put plainly, China seems determined to steal its way up the economic ladder, at our expense.''' ,'''We need to coordinate closely with international partners, right down to tightly-coordinated execution of seizures, searches, and arrests, so that instead of capturing a single criminal, we're taking down an entire enterprise.''' ,'''FISA is one of the most important investigative tools we've got in preventing our adversaries from harming our country.''' ,'''Our folks at the FBI and at DOJ are working their tails off every day to protect our nation's companies, our universities, our computer networks, and our ideas and innovation.''' ,'''The inability to access evidence or intelligence despite the lawful authority to do so significantly impacts the FBI's ability to identify, investigate, prosecute, or otherwise deter criminals, terrorists, and other offenders.''' ,'''The FBI is engaged in a myriad of efforts to combat cyber threats, from improving threat identification and information sharing inside and outside of the government to developing and retaining new talent, to examining the way we operate to disrupt and defeat these threats.''' ,'''I think it's important for the American people to be thoughtful consumers of information and to think about the sources of it and to think about the support and predication for what they hear.''' ,'''Some people are skeptical about the value of indictments where a foreign nation-state actor is involved. But in the case of APT10, the indictments marked an important step in publicly exposing China's continued practice of stealing intellectual property to give Chinese firms an unfair advantage in the marketplace.''' ,'''As a profession, we face unlimited threats with limited resources. We face a lack of trust in some of the communities we serve. We face a whole lot of second guessing and criticism about the work we're doing and the way we're doing it.''' ,'''When you can say, I get up in the morning to protect the American people and uphold the Constitution, it keeps people coming back. And I will stack our workforce up against anybody, anywhere, any day.''' ,'''I left DOJ's leadership back in 2005. At the time, we were still building our national security capabilities in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. And we'd made a lot of progress.''' ,'''Every officer, every deputy, every agent we lose is one too many. It's a loss to our organizations, of course, it's a loss to our community, and most importantly, it's a devastating loss to the loved ones they leave behind.''' ,'''FISA is a powerful tool - and we've got to be sure we're using it properly, at every step in the process. But we couldn't do our jobs without it.''' ,'''Your voice matters, so protect it.''' ,'''We've created these Protected Voices videos to showcase the methods these adversaries might use, and to help campaigns practice good cyber hygiene, because the foundation of election security is cybersecurity.''' ,'''Cyber criminals often operate through online forums, selling illicit goods and services, including tools that lower the barrier to entry for aspiring criminals and that can be used to facilitate malicious cyber activity.''' ,'''We have no information that indicates that Ukraine interfered with the 2016 presidential election.''' ,'''America's elections are the foundation of our democracy - so protecting them is a priority for the FBI and our partners.''' ,'''Non-violent protests are signs of a healthy democracy, not an ailing one.''' ,'''ISIS uses traditional media platforms as well as widespread social media campaigns to propagate its ideology. With the broad distribution of social media, terrorists can spot, assess, recruit, and radicalize vulnerable persons of all ages in the U.S. either to travel to foreign lands or to conduct an attack on the homeland.''' ,'''We will not stand idly by while any entity - be it a foreign power or corporation - seeks to criminally or unfairly undermine our country's place in the world.''' ,'''All too often, vital electronic evidence has been made unavailable through encryption that doesn't allow for execution of legal process including court-approved search warrants.''' ,'''9/11 was a gamechanger in so many terrible ways, not just for the United States and for our own national security apparatus but for the whole world. And those attacks blew apart any notion of separation between foreign and domestic threats, any notion that such attacks only happen to other people in other countries.''' ,'''The FBI's mission is to protect the American people and uphold the Constitution. To carry out that mission, we're entrusted with a lot of authority, so our actions are subject to close oversight - from the courts, from our elected leaders, and from independent entities like the inspector general.''' ,'''Technology companies have a front-line responsibility to secure their own networks, products, and platforms.''' ,'''The Chinese government's not pulling any punches. They want what we have so they can get the upper hand on us. And they're highly strategic in their approach - they're playing the long game.''' ,'''If you think about the average person and their interaction with law enforcement, their whole perspective on who we are and what we stand for - our brand, if you will - might be defined by just one interaction or encounter, a traffic stop, a visit to a school, or a response to a call for help.''' ,'''Terrorists in ungoverned spaces - both physical and cyber - readily disseminate propaganda and training materials to attract easily influenced individuals around the world to their cause. They motivate these individuals to act at home or encourage them to travel.''' ,'''In our country, the vast majority of our critical infrastructure and intellectual property is of course in the hands of the private sector.''' ,'''In this country, we value our open, free-market system - including the way it attracts international investment and talent to our country.''' ,'''Our adversaries - terrorists, foreign intelligence services, and criminals - take advantage of modern technology to hide their communications; recruit followers; and plan, conduct, and encourage espionage, cyber attacks, or terrorism to disperse information on different methods to attack the U.S. homeland and to facilitate other illegal activities.''' ,'''When law enforcement fails to fulfill its most basic duty to protect and serve its citizens, particularly members of a minority community, it not only tarnishes the badge we all wear, but erodes the trust that we in law enforcement have worked so hard to build.''' ,'''We need to hold ourselves accountable for the work we do and the choices we make.''' ,'''Protected Voices aims to help political campaigns, private companies, and individuals protect themselves from foreign actors who want to hijack their message.''' ,'''Cybersecurity is a central part of the FBI's mission. It's one part of the broader safety net we try to provide the American people: not only safe data, safe personal information, but also safe communities, safe schools.''' ,'''Whether core al Qaeda or its offshoots like AQAP, ISIS, or the many others - we are working with our partners to find and disrupt them, wherever they are, whether they're plotting attacks on Americans here at home or abroad.''' ,'''The FBI's mission is to protect the American people and uphold the Constitution. That mission is both dual and simultaneous - it is not contradictory.''' ,'''Our Constitution in many situations rightly demands a warrant or order before we take investigative steps. And the FISC provides that vital, independent oversight.''' ,'''We've got to make sure tech companies - all of them - aren't taking steps that will place content beyond the reach of the courts.''' ,'''What was once a comparatively minor threat - people hacking for fun or for bragging rights - has turned into full-blown economic espionage and extremely lucrative cyber crime.''' ,'''Lack of lawful access certainly affects our ability to do our jobs, but we know where the harm really falls when evidence is kept unavailable - it falls on innocent people, the people we're sworn to protect.''' ,'''Given our law enforcement authorities, our central role in the Intelligence Community, and the span of our responsibilities - from counterterrorism to counterintelligence to criminal investigations - we're particularly well-positioned to address cyber threats to our national security.''' ,'''China has pioneered a societal approach to stealing innovation in any way it can from a wide array of businesses, universities, and organizations.''' ,'''In pursuit of their commercial ambitions, Huawei relied on dishonest business practices that contradict the economic principles that have allowed American companies and the United States to thrive.''' ,'''Our folks at the FBI are working their tails off every day to stop and find criminals, terrorists, and nation-state adversaries.''' ,'''I am very committed to the FBI being agile in its tackling of foreign threats. But I believe you can be agile and still scrupulously follow our rules, policies and processes.''' ,'''My view is that, if any public official or member of any campaign is contacted by any nation-state or anybody acting on behalf of a nation-state about influencing or interfering with our election, then that is something that the FBI would want to know about.''' ,'''User-controlled default encryption is a real challenge for law enforcement.''' ,'''There's no shortage of opinions about our agency, just like every other agency up here - and just like the Congress. I'd encourage our folks not to get too hung up on what I consider to be the noise on TV and in social media.''' ,'''The work of the FBI, to put it mildly, is complex and covers just about every threat we face.''' ,'''As cyber threats evolve, we need to evolve as well.''' ,'''We are vested with significant authorities, and it is our obligation as public servants to ensure that these authorities are exercised with objectivity and integrity. Anything less falls short of the FBI's duty to the American people.''' ,'''It takes an incredibly special person to be willing to put his or her life on the line for a complete stranger. And to get up every morning, day after day after day, to do that, I think, is extraordinary.''' ,'''China has national security laws that compel Chinese companies to provide the government with information and access at their government's request. And virtually all Chinese companies of any size are required to have Communist Party 'cells' inside them, to make sure the companies stay in line with the party's principles and policies.''' ,'''The FBI that I see is people, decent people, committed to the highest principles of dignity and professionalism and respect... Now do we make mistakes? You bet we make mistakes, just like everybody who's human makes mistakes.''' ,'''Understanding the Chinese counterintelligence threat better will help us respond to it more effectively. China is taking a multi-faceted approach, so we've got to have a multi-faceted response.''' ,'''My loyalty is to the Constitution and the rule of law.''' ,'''We know that terrorism can happen anywhere, at anytime. And we know the best way to prevent an attack is by working together.''' ,'''I can't imagine a situation where, as FBI director, I would be giving a press conference on an uncharged individual, much less talking in detail about it.''' ,'''We, the FBI, don't investigate ideology, no matter how repugnant. When it turns to violence, we're all over it.''' ,'''As the Director of the FBI, I am committed to ensuring that the Bureau is being transparent and responsive to legitimate congressional requests.''' ,'''All American voices are important, and the FBI's Protected Voices videos and resources will help all Americans protect themselves online.''' ,'''We protect the American people from a staggering range of threats. But make no mistake, securing the homeland against terrorism remains our top priority.''' ,'''It is the honor of a lifetime to serve as Director. I long ago grew to know and admire the FBI from my earliest days as a line prosecutor to my years as assistant attorney general.''' ,'''Healthy competition is good for the global economy. Criminal conduct is not. Rampant theft is not. Cheating is not.''' ,'''It's going to take all of us working together to protect our economic security and our way of life. The American people expect and deserve no less.''' ,'''At the end of the day, our work is what endures.''' ,'''There's a clear distinction between activities that threaten the security and integrity of our election systems, and the broader threat from influence operations designed to influence voters.''' ,'''We all want safe, secure, private data, but we also want safe and secure communities. And we can have both. I really do believe that.''' ,'''In everything we do, as long as I have anything to say about it, we're going to follow the facts independently, wherever they may lead, to whomever they may lead, no matter who likes it.''' ,'''It takes an incredibly special person to be willing to put his or her life on the line for the community, and we owe it to our law enforcement heroes to do whatever we can to make their work safer.''' ,'''The prosperity that drives our economic security is inherently linked to our national security. And the immense influence that the Chinese government holds over Chinese corporations like Huawei represents a threat to both.''' ,'''Every time I attend an FBI graduation for new agents or new analysts at Quantico, a significant number of those graduates are former state and local officers, and I have the privilege of shaking their hands, presenting them with their credentials, and welcoming them to the FBI family.''' ,'''Just as our adversaries evolve, so, too, must the FBI.''' ,'''The FBI holds sacred the rights of individuals to peacefully exercise their First Amendment freedoms.''' ,'''China has pioneered a societal approach to stealing innovation any way it can, from a wide array of businesses, universities, and organizations.''' ,'''I will say that one of the things that hackers, of all shapes and sizes, prize the most in this world is anonymity and stealth and deniability. And by indicting them publicly, among other things, we strip them of that.''' ,'''A line of duty death, whether an officer, special agent, or professional staff employee, is personal to the FBI, and it's personal to me as Director.''' ,'''We take all potential threats to public and private sector systems seriously and will continue to investigate and hold accountable those who pose a threat in cyberspace.''' ,'''I can tell you that there are lots of ways for people to express their views and their disagreements. For me, the idea of doing it through an anonymous op-ed is about the furthest thing from my mind.''' ,'''We've shown that when an attack does happen, our agents and analysts will move heaven and earth to find those responsible.''' ,'''Where protection of certain sensitive information is well-founded, I remain committed to upholding the laws and longstanding policies governing classification and public release.''' ,'''The men and women of the FBI are deployed around the clock, all over our country and around the world, identifying and disrupting threats, and pursuing those who would do us harm.''' ,'''My view is that the cyber threat is bigger than any one government agency - or even the government itself. But the FBI brings a rare combination of scope and scale, experience, and tools to the mix. We investigate criminal activity like intrusions and cyber attacks, but we also investigate national security threats like foreign influence.''' ,'''The threat from unmanned aircraft systems in the U.S. is steadily escalating.''' ,'''As Americans, we should all be concerned by the potential for any company beholden to a foreign government - especially one that doesn't share our values - to burrow into the American telecommunications market.''' ,'''I would argue that in the cyber arena, the need for private sector partnership is higher than really anywhere else of any program we have. So, the reality is we couldn't do what we do without the private sector, and vice versa.''' ,'''Our adversaries are trying to undermine our country on a persistent and regular basis, whether it's election season or not.''' ,]
