- I'd be a rubbish policewoman in real life.
- I feel like Bridgerton is the way that I get to reach out to people.
- I'm not very attached to my phone and am naturally quite an introvert - and I'm OK with that.
- Usually on jobs I'm quite philosophical and think 'The right girl gets the part and everything is meant to be.'
- After my audition for 'Bridgerton,' I put it out there to the universe, and I bought the book. I was like, 'Right. If I commit, then I'll get the job.' And it worked.
- I think we're becoming a bit less attached to consumerism.
- When you join something that's from Netflix, you know it's not gonna be terrible.
- Eloise is obsessed with Lady Whistledown, and she is a worthy opponent to try and find her. But, I reckon, more than half of the obsession is the fact that for her, Lady Whistledown is an expression of the potential for freedom that Eloise talks about so avidly.
- I do wear prescription glasses off screen, though I didn't wear them to any of the auditions until the read-through.
- But when I got into my teens, I didn't have money. And then, getting into my early 20s, I still didn't have money. And charity shops would be a great place for me to get cheap clothes.
- I was filming 'Father Brown' when my agent told me about the audition. As soon as I heard the words 'Line of Duty,' I was so excited.
- There's not one person that hasn't felt like they've been on the outside looking in and going, 'What the hell is that?'
- In Vanity Fair, everyone messes up.
- Art is supposed to change and grow and accord with the times. It seems perfect to me that we have a period drama with a core of modern times.
- It's difficult being young; but holding on to a sense of identity is really important in life.
- I moved to London to get an agent, though that took a while - everyone said no, understandably.
- I'm vegan, Buddhist, minimalist, an actor. I'm very friendly, though. If I wasn't I think it would be easier to be, like, 'You're a bit of a knob.'
- Each day I'm trying to figure out how I can be more courageous, kinder and compassionate.
- The Internet is a great communication tool, but just like anything, there can be negative aspects.
- I've been doing a lot of children's dramas, but I really wanted to move into more gritty stuff.
- The idea of marriage and children isn't at the front of my mind.
- I've never wanted anything other than to be happy and I just follow my nose as to what that means.
- I think I'm probably far too emotional, which is good as actress but not so flash for a police officer.
- I'm terrible at taking breaks.
- We didn't have much money growing up and charity shops were the most reasonable option, I think. But my mum's always recycled, reused, restored and repaired.
- I was obsessed with vintage stuff, I was obsessed with sort of the old lady floral patterns and like Paisley stuff.
- My family were so poor. My mum would clean houses to maybe get me to a ballet class, bless her.
- I've chopped off a good chunk of my hair and gone darker and I look a bit older.
- On paper I'm incredibly annoying.
- Birmingham has managed to keep that warmth, and it has the friendliest people. I can't see why I would want to leave.
- We've seen Shakespeare done a billion times to make it seem relevant today. We love period dramas. We love to long for a time gone by.
- Comedy makes things believable. Because if there's anything we all know, it's how to make fun of ourselves, and to make fun of situations to make them a bit easier.
- I didn't get etiquette classes, which is a shame because someone like me needs them.
- Maybe people who aren't too interested in period pieces will be now because 'Bridgerton' is so contemporary, so modern.
- None of us knows what a good or bad person is. In real life we're all brilliant and a bit rubbish.
