quotes = ['''In theater, the show must go on, so you train yourself to be able to nail it every single time because that's what the audience deserves, and that's the magic of live theater.''' ,'''There's a subtleness to camera work. You can really create intimate moments on camera, and sometimes that requires a little more precision from an actor because you have to pull people in as opposed to throwing it to them.''' ,'''I got a note from the stage manager one night that someone wanted to meet me. And it was Steven Spielberg.''' ,'''I think the theater is basically the boot camp for the actor. If you can survive the rigors of an eight-show-a-week schedule and be at your best all the time, you can handle virtually everything because no other craft requires you to get it right every single time.''' ,'''I absolutely loved my stint on Broadway in 'Hairspray.'''' ,'''I was born and raised in Richmond, Virginia, the capital of the Confederacy.''' ,'''I feel like a lot of the portrayals of, in particular, younger minority ethnic characters on television, a lot of their dialogue, a lot of their characteristics, a lot of their personality in a writer's eyes, is kind of propelled through their ethnicity.''' ,'''In my case, I've always been interested in law enforcement. I've always dabbled in law enforcement in between gigs, quite honestly. Back before things really began to pop off for me, I would work in private security for companies and stuff.''' ,'''I think you can spread yourself way too thin way too easily, so when I'm trying to create, I'm trying to create ideas for projects and have a vision for other people.''' ,]
