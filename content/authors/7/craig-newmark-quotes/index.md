quotes = ['''Realize that you can't make everyone happy.''' ,'''Craigslist does serve as a platform where people help each other for the basics, and also, shows people that the Internet is good for mutual support. I do feel pretty good about that.''' ,'''I'm not in the news business and won't tell people how to do their job. I'd like to restore trust in the news business, though, and feel that restoring fact-checking will really help. News business realities mean that such fact-checking has to be practical, it has to be fast and cheap.''' ,'''A lot of people, myself included, are excited about blogging and stuff like that, citizen journalism, but I do remind people that no matter how excited we are, there's no substitute for professional writing, no substitute for professional editing, and no substitute for professional fact-checking.''' ,'''Okay, I'm not in the news business, and I'm not going to tell anyone how to do their job. However, it'd be good to have news reporting that I could trust again, and there's evidence that fact-checking is an idea whose time has come.''' ,'''I'd like to build a way for people doing good work to connect, to learn from each other, protect each other, and then I want to get out of their way.''' ,'''Milestones aren't what I think about much.''' ,'''Do something real, and keep it simple.''' ,'''Right now, the biggest shared value that I can think of is that you should treat others the way you want to be treated, and just have some good sense about what matters to you.''' ,'''In business, there are times when you disagree, and sometimes it turns out that you're just plain wrong. Humor takes away tension and helps you realize you're wrong.''' ,'''The problem is that with blogging, the model is publish first, maybe fact-check later. In newspapers, the model is you fact check first and then publish. But those models are merging.''' ,'''I do think the biggest problem newspapers have is loss of trust, and I feel that's a result of failure to speak truth to power.''' ,]
