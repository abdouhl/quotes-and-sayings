- For a long time I thought I should be a civil engineer. That seemed to be the only thing worth doing, and I chose the wrong subjects at A-level. I read all the sciences to start with, and then had to admit, 'This isn't what I want to do' and changed course.
- You can't understand Twenties England until you appreciate it was under a cloud of mourning. Nearly everyone was grieving.
- I'm often accused of being prudish, but the opposite is true.
- No, there are no hard and fast rules about sources, no printed booklet to help journalists through.
- They may well say not only is this not true, but I will put in an injunction to prevent publication. No, stories don't go in unless I'm convinced by the people who write them that they're true. And if I'm wrong, then so be it.
