quotes = ['''There were a number of people who helped me get there, and the one I always mention is Michael Byrne, the great master swordsman and brilliant stunt double.''' ,'''But he did say that the character would be on the sidelines in movies One and Two, and move into the middle with number Three, but I didn't realize he would move in with quite such a bang.''' ,'''When George asked me to be the prequels, it was the same kind of meeting - it was very short and to the point.

It's a chance to really act emotionally, because the situation is an extreme one.''' ,]
