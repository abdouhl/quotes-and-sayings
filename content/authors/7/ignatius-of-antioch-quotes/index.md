quotes = ['''Let not then any one deceive you, as indeed you are not deceived, inasmuch as you are wholly devoted to God.''' ,'''Take heed, then, often to come together to give thanks to God, and show forth His praise. For when you assemble frequently in the same place, the powers of Satan are destroyed, and the destruction at which he aims is prevented by the unity of your faith.''' ,'''There is one Physician, of flesh and of spirit, originate and unoriginate, God in man, true Life in death, son of Mary and son of God, first passible and then impassible: Jesus Christ our Lord.''' ,'''Pray to Christ for me that the animals will be the means of making me a sacrificial victim for God.''' ,'''They that are of the flesh cannot do the works of the Spirit, neither can they that are spiritual do the works of the flesh, even as faith cannot do the works of unbelief, nor unbelief the works of faith.''' ,'''I have many deep thoughts in God, but I take my own measure, lest I perish by boasting... For I myself, though I am in chains and can comprehend heavenly things, the ranks of the angels and the hierarchy of principalities, things visible and invisible, for all this I am not yet a disciple.''' ,'''Let us therefore be of a reverent spirit, and fear the long-suffering of God, that it tend not to our condemnation.''' ,'''It is outrageous to utter the name of Jesus Christ and live in Judaism.''' ,'''Let no rank puff up anyone; for faith and love are paramount - the greatest blessings in the world.''' ,'''Now I begin to be a disciple... Let fire and cross, flocks of beasts, broken bones, dismemberment... come upon me, so long as I attain to Jesus Christ.''' ,'''From Syria even to Rome I fight with wild beasts, by land and sea, by night and by day, being bound amidst ten leopards, even a company of soldiers, who only grow worse when they are kindly treated.''' ,'''I prefer death in Christ Jesus to power over the farthest limits of the earth. He who died in place of us is the one object of my quest. He who rose for our sakes is my one desire.''' ,'''Even though I be bound in the Name, I have not yet become perfected in Jesus Christ.''' ,'''I have no taste for corruptible food nor for the pleasures of this life. I desire the Bread of God, which is the Flesh of Jesus Christ, who was of the seed of David, and for drink I desire His Blood, which is love incorruptible.''' ,'''You must all follow the lead of the bishop, as Jesus Christ followed that of the Father; follow the presbytery as you would the Apostles; reverence the deacons as you would God's commandment.''' ,'''Nothing is better than peace, by which all warfare of heavenly and earthly foes is brought to naught.''' ,'''May nothing entice me till I happily make my way to Jesus Christ! Fire, cross, struggles with wild beasts, wrenching of bones, mangling of limbs - let them come to me, provided only I make my way to Jesus Christ.''' ,'''I am writing to all the churches to let it be known that I will gladly die for God if only you do not stand in my way... Let me be food for the wild beasts, for they are my way to God.''' ,'''Wherever the bishop appears, there let the people be, even as wheresoever Christ Jesus is, there is the catholic church.''' ,'''Only let it be in the name of Jesus Christ, that I may suffer together with Him! I endure everything because He Himself, Who is perfect man, empowers me.''' ,'''Nothing is more precious than peace, by which all war, both in Heaven and Earth, is brought to an end.''' ,'''Even the heavenly powers and the angels in their splendor and the principalities, both visible and invisible, must either believe in the Blood of Christ, or else face damnation.''' ,'''I would rather die and come to Jesus Christ than be king over the entire earth. Him I seek who died for us; Him I love who rose again because of us.''' ,'''I am God's wheat, and I shall be ground by the teeth of beasts, that I may become the pure bread of Christ.''' ,'''Reverence the deacons as you would the command of God.''' ,]
