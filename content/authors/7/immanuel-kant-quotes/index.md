There is nothing higher than reason.''' ,'''I had therefore to remove knowledge, in order to make room for belief.''' ,'''He who is cruel to animals becomes hard also in his dealings with men.

What can I know? 2. What ought I to do? 3. What may I hope?''' ,'''What can I know? What ought I to do? What can I hope?''' ,'''The only objects of practical reason are therefore those of good and evil.

In ethics he is guilty if he only thinks of doing so.''' ,'''All thought must, directly or indirectly, by way of certain characters, relate ultimately to intuitions, and therefore, with us, to sensibility, because in no other way can an object be given to us.''' ,'''So act that your principle of action might safely be made a law for the whole world.''' ,'''Even philosophers will praise war as ennobling mankind, forgetting the Greek who said: 'War is bad in that it begets more evil than it kills.'''' ,'''By a lie, a man... annihilates his dignity as a man.''' ,'''Intuition and concepts constitute... the elements of all our knowledge, so that neither concepts without an intuition in some way corresponding to them, nor intuition without concepts, can yield knowledge.''' ,'''Morality is not the doctrine of how we may make ourselves happy, but how we may make ourselves worthy of happiness.''' ,'''But although all our knowledge begins with experience, it does not follow that it arises from experience.''' ,'''Immaturity is the incapacity to use one's intelligence without the guidance of another.''' ,'''It is not necessary that whilst I live I live happily; but it is necessary that so long as I live I should live honourably.''' ,'''Metaphysics is a dark ocean without shores or lighthouse, strewn with many a philosophic wreck.''' ,'''Ingratitude is the essence of vileness.''' ,'''May you live your life as if the maxim of your actions were to become universal law.''' ,'''Thoughts without content are empty, intuitions without concepts are blind.''' ,'''From such crooked wood as that which man is made of, nothing straight can be fashioned.''' ,'''It is not God's will merely that we should be happy, but that we should make ourselves happy.''' ,'''Seek not the favor of the multitude; it is seldom got by honest and lawful means. But seek the testimony of few; and number not voices, but weigh them.''' ,'''Nothing is divine but what is agreeable to reason.''' ,]
