quotes = ['''I dreaded having a boring life when I grew up. And I certainly can't complain about being bored.''' ,'''We midwives and physicians have a lot to teach each other.''' ,'''The best a health care system can do is to equip itself to meet the needs of each individual woman and birth. Those needs run the gamut from undisturbed home birth to planned cesarean section.''' ,'''If birth matters, midwives matter.
