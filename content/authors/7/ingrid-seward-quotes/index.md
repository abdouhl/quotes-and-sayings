Kate certainly shows no sign of adopting the horsey, doggy lifestyle beloved of her grandmother-in-law. But the Queen admires how well Kate has embraced royal life, combining it cheerfully with duty and motherhood.''' ,'''As the Supreme Governor of the Church of England, the Queen feels she cannot be seen to smile in church - and her natural reaction is to combat mirth by putting on a stern face.''' ,'''The Queen made a great fuss of her future daughter-in-law, trying to demonstrate that she was interested in Diana for her personal qualities and not just for what she represented, as the wife of the heir to the throne.''' ,'''Indeed, the Royal Family still retain the German custom - introduced by Prince Albert - of opening their presents on Christmas Eve rather than Christmas morning.''' ,'''The path of royal romance has never been smooth; Princess Margaret was unable to marry the man she loved because it meant renouncing her royal status, yet her uncle, the Duke of Windsor, gave up an empire for Wallis Simpson.''' ,'''Sometimes it can be difficult for me if Ross writes something inaccurate or hurtful.
