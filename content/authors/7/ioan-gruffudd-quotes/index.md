- I know I'm as comfortable doing period as I am contemporary. I suppose we grow up with it in a sense, in the theater. We get to put on costumes and play a lot of period dramas or plays so we're exposed to it a little bit more I think because of our theatrical background.

- I know there are some actors who are just brilliant at improvising and brilliant at just being in the moment and doing it there and then. I'm not one of those actors.
- Often in my game as an actor, someone else pays for your travel and there's nothing like being able to lie flat on a flight home from L.A.

- I'm determined not to lose my name. It's who I am. It has neither aided my progress nor hampered it. It's just who I am.
- One often doesn't often get to do the same part, over and over again, unless you do a run in the theater.
- When you're younger, you're going to be cast as the heroic, earnest leading man.
