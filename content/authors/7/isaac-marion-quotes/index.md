- I adapt to things quickly, including good things, which I wish I could shut off sometimes.
- Regret is pointless. I never do anything without first deciding to do it based on facts and feelings, and if it doesn't work out how I hoped, oh well - there's another notch on my experience belt.
- It's rare that I read more than two or three books by any one author; usually only one.
- I used to split my time between writing, music and painting. I would work on a book and then abandon it, start a band, do an album, quit music, then do a gallery show. Eventually I decided to give writing a serious shot.
- The kind of stuff I usually read is a bit more on the literary side, like books that I think are influential in the sense that they're doing pulpy subject matter in a refined way. Like 'The Road' by Cormac McCarthy; I loved that book.
- I've always been interested in writing from the perspective of an outsider.
- Every experience, good or bad, is a priceless collector's item.
- Sometimes it's a struggle to live in the moment.
- My favorite songs change every year.
- 'Warm Bodies' ended up becoming one of the most personal relatable things I've written.
