quotes = ['''May your divinity, Lord, take pleasure in me and lead me above the world to be with you.''' ,'''O Christ, on you the many-eyed cherubim are unable to look because of the glory of your countenance, yet out of your love you accepted spittle on your face. Remove the shame from my face, and grant me to have an unashamed face before you at the time of prayer.''' ,'''Be at peace with your own soul, then heaven and earth will be at peace with you.''' ,'''If God is slow in answering your request, or if you ask but do not promptly receive anything, do not be upset, for you are not wiser than God.''' ,'''Wishing to open my mouth, O brethren, and speak on the exalted theme of humility, I am filled with fear, even as a man who understands that he is about to discourse concerning God with the art of his own words. For humility is the raiment of the Godhead.''' ,'''Do not test out your mind on the grounds that you are examining what seductive and impure thoughts look like, imagining that, as you do this, you will not be overcome by them. Even the wise have in this way been thrown into confusion and become infatuated.''' ,'''If zeal had been appropriate for putting humanity right, why did God the Word clothe himself in the body, using gentleness and humility in order to bring the world back to his Father?''' ,]
