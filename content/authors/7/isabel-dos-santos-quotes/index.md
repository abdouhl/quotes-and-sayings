- I'm not involved in politics, and I've never had any political role. I've never been in office. I've never taken any public administrative jobs.
- It's very difficult, I would imagine, to distinguish father and daughter. And maybe some of it comes as I'm doing my thing and my father being a very strong political African figure for so many years. Whatever he does is almost like some kind of cloud on top.
- I think there's lots of people with family connections but who are actually nowhere. If you're hard-working and determined, you will make it, and that's the bottom line. I don't believe in an easy way through.
- I've had business sense since I was very young. I sold chicken eggs when I was six.
