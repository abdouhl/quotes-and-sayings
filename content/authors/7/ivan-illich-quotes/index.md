quotes = ['''Modern medicine is a negation of health. It isn't organized to serve human health, but only itself, as an institution. It makes more people sick than it heals.''' ,'''There is no greater distance than that between a man in prayer and God.''' ,'''Tools can rule men sooner than they expect; the plow makes man the lord of the garden but also the refugee from the dust bowl.''' ,'''Once the Third World has become a mass market for the goods, products, and processes which are designed by the rich for themselves, the discrepancy between demand for these Western artifacts and the supply will increase indefinitely.''' ,'''I didn't want to go into the papal bureaucracy, so I thought of doing a postdoctoral thesis, which they call a 'Habilitation' in German universities, on alchemy in the work of Albert the Great.''' ,'''The compulsion to do good is an innate American trait. Only North Americans seem to believe that they always should, may, and actually can choose somebody with whom to share their blessings. Ultimately this attitude leads to bombing people into the acceptance of gifts.''' ,'''Schools that are freely accessible allow the organization of certain specific learning tasks which a person might propose to himself. Schools, when they are compulsory - as we see at this moment in the United States - create a dazed population, a 'learned' population, a mentally pretentious population, such as we have never seen before.''' ,'''We must rediscover the distinction between hope and expectation.''' ,'''The college and university systems, at least, have become like television. There's a bit of this and a bit of that and some compulsory program with its components connected in a way that only a planner could understand.''' ,'''The telephone lets anybody say what he wants to the person of his choice; he can conduct business, express love, or pick a quarrel. It is impossible for bureaucrats to define what people say to each other on the phone, even though they can interfere with - or protect - the privacy of their exchange.''' ,'''Effective health care depends on self-care; this fact is currently heralded as if it were a discovery.''' ,'''The idea of Homo monolinguis - one-languaged man - the idea of children having to grow into one system before we confuse them with another mental system, is an idea with which, unfortunately, many people are brought up now.''' ,'''Leadership does not depend on being right.''' ,'''Healthy people are those who live in healthy homes on a healthy diet; in an environment equally fit for birth, growth work, healing, and dying... Healthy people need no bureaucratic interference to mate, give birth, share the human condition and die.''' ,'''I've nothing against schools! I'm against compulsory schooling.''' ,'''Most people, throughout history, haven't learned one language to the exclusion of another. You learn to speak differently to a peasant and to a shoemaker. You speak differently to your mother, who comes from Burgundy, and to your father, who comes from Swabia.''' ,'''Up to now, economic development has always meant that people, instead of doing something, are enabled to buy it... Economic development has also meant that, after a time, people must buy the commodity because the conditions under which they could get along without it had disappeared from their physical, social, or cultural environment.''' ,'''I consider the indiscriminate propagation of self-help to be morally unacceptable... self-help is the opposite of autonomous or vernacular life.''' ,'''So persuasive is the power of the institutions we have created that they shape not only our preferences but actually our sense of possibilities.''' ,'''Huge institutions producing costly services dominate the horizons of our inventiveness.''' ,'''We have become unable to think of better education except in terms of more complex schools and of teachers trained for ever longer periods.''' ,'''School divides life into two segments, which are increasingly of comparable length. As much as anything else, schooling implies custodial care for persons who are declared undesirable elsewhere by the simple fact that a school has been built to serve them.''' ,'''By the early seventeenth century, a new consensus began to arise: the idea that man was born incompetent for society and remained so unless he was provided with 'education.'''' ,'''The public school has become the established church of secular society.''' ,'''At the moment of death I hope to be surprised.''' ,]
