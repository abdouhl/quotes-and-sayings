- I don't really know what the future of science is. Maybe we have come to the end of science; maybe science is a finite field. The inventions resulting from this finite field, however, are boundless.
- While classical mechanics correctly predicts the behavior of large objects such as tennis balls, to predict the behavior of small objects such as electrons, we must use quantum mechanics.
- There are just two things you can do to win a Nobel prize - have a good idea and pursue it effectively.
- Understanding truth is the primary objective of science, not doing good for the world.
- I would say that, basically, global warming is a non-problem.
- 'Incontrovertible' is not a scientific word. Nothing is incontrovertible in science.
- When I was 28 years old, I found myself in Schenectady, New York, where I discovered that it was possible for some people to make a good living as physicists.
- My own beliefs are that the road to a scientific discovery is seldom direct and that it does not necessarily require great expertise. In fact, I am convinced that often a newcomer to a field has a great advantage because he is ignorant and does not know all the complicated reasons why a particular experiment should not be attempted.
- If you're a physicist, for heaven's sake, and here is the experiment, and you have a theory, and the theory doesn't agree with the experiment, then you have to cut out the theory. You were wrong with the theory.
- You need to be curious, competitive, creative, stubborn, self-confident, skeptical, patient and be lucky to win a Nobel.
- If I have learned anything as a scientist, it is that one should not make things complicated when a simple explanation will do.
- If you want to help Africa, you should help them out of poverty, not try to build solar cells and windmills.
- Global warming has become a new religion. We frequently hear about the number of scientists who support it. But the number is not important: only whether they are correct is important. We don't really know what the actual effect on the global temperature is. There are better ways to spend the money.
- There are 15 main theories in physics, and we know all of them. If there weren't a finite number of theories, there would not be a point to physics.
- Science is to find something unknown, while invention is to make something new out of the known theory.
