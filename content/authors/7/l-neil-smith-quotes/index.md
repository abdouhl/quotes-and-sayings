The man freed not a single slave.''' ,'''It is individuals who must be encouraged to undertake the unprecedented - and unprecedentedly profitable - effort to prevent the annihilation of the human race.''' ,'''People in the mass media tend more and more every day to look and act like elected and appointed officials.''' ,'''It's often been observed that the first casualty of war is the truth.
