We have temples and mosques, gurdwaras and churches. But we do not bring all this into politics... This is the difference between India and Pakistan.''' ,'''Our way is straight and clear - the building up of a socialist democracy at home, with freedom and prosperity for all, and the maintenance of world peace and friendship with all nations abroad.''' ,'''We believe in freedom, freedom for the people of each country to follow their destiny without external interference.''' ,'''Discipline and united action are the real source of strength for the nation.''' ,'''We have to surmount the difficulties that face us and work steadfastly for the happiness and prosperity of our country.''' ,'''We believe in peace and peaceful development, not only for ourselves but for people all over the world.''' ,'''We cannot afford to spend millions and millions over nuclear arms when there is poverty and unemployment all around us.''' ,'''No doubt we have to have bigger projects, bigger industries, basic industries, but it is a matter of the highest importance that we look to the common man, the weakest element in the society.''' ,]
