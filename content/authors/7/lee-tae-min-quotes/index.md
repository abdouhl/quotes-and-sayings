- For the 'Heaven' stage, the dancers and I don't use wires so we are slowly slipping down the stage if you see us up close.
- I always imagine, and try to be on the lookout, for new things, for references that can inspire me creatively so I can showcase things that people haven't done before or that are new.
- We have dance songs and ballad songs, but Baekhyun's voice plays a very important role. That's a really important speciality of Baekhyun.
- The synergy created from clothing, hair, and makeup combined is truly amazing, so makeup has been, is, and will be a key factor in establishing my identity as an artist.
- I wanted to break the idea of what male performers are supposed to show, what performances girl groups are supposed to show. I really wanted to break those labels, showing that dance is a form of art.
- I envy Jonghyun's technique and energy, Onew's voice, Key's rapping skills and Minho's looks.
- I spent about a total of one year preparing for the 'Want' album.
- I feel like I have two different selves, one for being a part of SHINee and one as a solo artist.
- I feel proud to be a member of SHINee. It is a great team with a unique identity.
- If you ask me, I'd say what the world now considers K-Pop began with SM Entertainment. SM was the very first company to take musical influences from Western culture and incorporate Korean culture into that by rearranging and writing lyrics with our style.
- For me, my mentor was Rain who I like and admire so much. To be able to appear in the same place with him as a mentor to someone is meaningful and such an honor.
- I wanted to go beyond what K-pop is typically perceived as, and through 'Move' I was able to show a concept that's more edgy, more powerful.
- I've been in SHINee for 10 years, so starting a new team almost felt like getting a different job. I was excited; it felt so fresh, like a new start. To be honest, I thought the project was going to get cancelled when I first heard about it, so SuperM has a special place in my heart.
- When we actually met our U.S. fans, it was slightly awkward and new at first, but it made me think that we should really visit more often in order to grow closer and more comfortable with our fans here.
- K-pop itself is not just a music genre, but a whole cultural phenomenon.
- I want to express myself but, at the same time, still be special and different.
- I don't want to compare SuperM to any of the other groups.
- As an artist who performs on the stage, I try to express my feelings and convey my inner thoughts through the looks I give the audience. So, I tend to focus on making sure that my makeup highlights my eyes properly.
- From time to time, there are moments when I feel that even the smallest experiences from the past can be applied to something greater in the future.
- I would like to recommend 'After Putting On Makeup' off our 1st LP, 'The SHINee World.' All of our albums are meaningful to us, but I have more attachment towards it because it is our first album.
- We've definitely had our share of ups and downs as a group, and there were times we've faced some pretty big challenges, but we were able to get through these times, which allowed our bond to grow stronger.
- When we work together as a group we don't contribute individually as much as I do when I'm working on my solos. I try to give as much input when I'm working on a song or album but as a group it's kind of difficult since there are five of us. Having all of us contribute to the same extent is a little more challenging than when doing our own things.
- I have always admired Michael Jackson, and he's the one I get most inspiration from. I hope to become an artist like him as he won so many people's hearts and gave that love back to them through his music.
- I like 'I Can't Stand the Rain.' I like it because it has a really oriental feeling to it, an 'oriental taste,' it has an essence of Asia.
- The memories of my time with Jonghyun are precious to me. He's like family to me, so I will never forget him and I will always keep him in my heart.
- All the songs are good, but 'Press Your Number' was fixed to be my favorite song from the beginning.
- I want to make a good impact on the K-pop music world.
- I'm always thinking about what my identity is.
- Just as your attitude changes depending on where you are, I choose my clothes according a situation I'll be placed in. However, I usually like to wear casual and comfortable outfits for the most part.
- Recording and performing 'Replay' was a learning process throughout, as we focused on the details.
- I listen to a lot of religion-based music, culturally rich music. Ethnic and world music. Music from Latin America has been influencing me in particular.
- I really wanted my fans to understand that outer appearances really don't matter.
- I always want to be the person that's able to try something new.
- For me, I think there is no absolute standard on masculinity.
- When other people look at K-pop with a more traditional Western lens, or when people listen to it, it may sound like a combination of all different genres.
- I can try new genres because I know there are fans who will always be there to support what I would like to pursue.
- I really want to go on a tour in the U.S.
- I liked Bruno Mars from way back before he even debuted. I thought he had a beautiful voice and became a huge fan after listening to his first album.
- No, I haven't been single since birth.
- If makeup highlights and empowers my unique appeal, why not use it?
- I wanted to write a song that can comfort you, and make you feel like I take you to 'Heaven.'
