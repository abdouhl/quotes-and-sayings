There is too much icky stuff about it - all this stuff about people reunited, a sickly sentimentality about blood lines. For me, at least, life is much more ambiguous than that.''' ,'''That conversation about 'roles for women,' generally - 'roles for older women.' It's like, let's please not dig into that one any more, you know?''' ,'''I love euro TV drama, there's some fantastic shows.''' ,'''I've been so grateful for writing, and writers and, actually I would say that that is the cornerstone of my career, the writing.

I like having my own life too much!''' ,'''I think what maybe starts out when you're younger as being something about slightly showing off or being given applause because people think that you're good at something, as you get older it becomes less about that and it becomes more about the fascination of why people do the things that they do.''' ,'''I've worked with Gemma Jones before, so the opportunity to re-connect with her, and for us to play mother and daughter, was superb.''' ,'''You know when actors are very shy and self-effacing? Well, I really love it when people like my work, but I'm also really embarrassed about it. It's strange. And a bit pathetic really.''' ,'''It's very important to do things that you believe in - if you're bored by what you do, try something else.''' ,'''All the Enid Blyton books - they opened my eyes to a bunch of kids living a life that was so far away from mine.''' ,'''I didn't want to be invisible.

You try to have an idea about why somebody does what they do and you try not to be in judgmental about it. That is what psychologists and psychotherapists aim to do with their patients.''' ,'''Playgrounds are like microcosms of the world, aren't they?

And my private life is my private life.''' ,'''We can't all have faces like Elizabeth Taylor or Angelina Jolie.''' ,'''That's the thing about 'Three Girls' I found most upsetting.
