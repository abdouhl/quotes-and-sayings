- Actors are always the last to see what they have created.

- I'm ready to be an action figure. I'd love that very much. And all the redheaded kids will get to go out and feel loved and be able to buy a redheaded action figure.
- As an actor, you pay attention very closely to everything that happens to you, and you're constantly watching others as well, trying to just find out where everything comes from.
- You don't want to meet anybody in Cannes. It's the worst place, I think, to meet somebody - one of the worst places.
- Writing songs is an essential part of my life: my mother teaches piano, and I have inherited my grandparents' passion for music, especially from my grandfather Tommy, who was a great drummer. It's no coincidence that I play the drums best, but I am also good with the guitar and the piano.
- I usually listen to classic rock and roll.
- Well, I'm a Texas boy, and we have denim in our blood.
- I have been acting since I was thirteen.
- I don't know if I'm a method actor.
- I came to the industry with wide eyes and an open heart thinking I was going to make a few films that really meant something that I could pour myself into.
