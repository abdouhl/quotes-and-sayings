quotes = ['''Hey, once a Bond girl, always a Bond girl. It will always be a big deal - it's an exclusive club.''' ,'''I used to always buy clothes too big, but I should have showed off instead of covering up.''' ,'''All eyes are on you when you're modeling and acting, and I just didn't want the attention when I wasn't working. But as I've gotten older, I've become more comfortable with my body and am taking more fashion risks.''' ,'''I've always had a tomboy look.''' ,'''I didn't fall into the category of the 'classic Bond girl.' I had short hair - and no Bond girl before me ever had. They put me in a wig at the beginning of the film, and then had my character cut her hair to pretend to be someone else. That was to explain why my hair was short.''' ,]
