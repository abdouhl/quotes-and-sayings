- I don't think just being skinny means necessarily anorexic.
- I hope one day when I say I'm from Estonia, people don't say: 'What? Where's that?'
- I have a figure, and there aren't many girls out there right now who have that.
- You know what I always dreamed of? That with the greenhouse effect, one day Estonia can be what L.A. is right now. I always thought when the end of the world comes, I want to be in Estonia. I think then I'd survive.
- I get paid to work; I don't pay to work.
- We feel free. We're independent. People can be openly proud of being Estonian. I have a lot of belief in Estonia.
- Places like New York are just too intense, too much about money, too much about ambition; it's all too superficial for me.
- It's not really like you have a thing like a supermodel anymore. It's more of a word than a real existence. I think, also, looking at it from a designer's point of view, at one point maybe they felt the stars took too much attention away from the clothes.
- I don't think Estonians ever really hated Russians. It was more, 'Leave us alone.' We can't change what is past. We can't blame them for what their parents have done. We never hated them. They didn't destroy us that bad.
