- What matters about people is their magnetic leadership, their aptitude for helping those following in their footsteps, and their passion - how they choose to package that is their prerogative.
- We work more than we do anything else in our lives, but the average person only interacts with four to five colleagues. Outside of that, they don't build that many relationships.
- An interview is about mutual selection.
- As CEO of Levo, a millennial-focused career platform, I'm fascinated by how others turn their passion into success.
- I want every single millennial woman to feel like Levo has improved their lives.
- Look at an interview as an organic part of building a relationship.
- The busier you get, and the more forward-looking you become, the more difficult it is to actually acknowledge and gain strength and inspiration from the things you've already accomplished, which can become problematic when you're in a startup.
- The interview is not over when the meeting is over. Never forget that.
- Having women who are already successful take the leap of faith to help younger women is critical.
- You don't get what you deserve - it would be amazing if life worked out that way.
- You are bigger than your self-doubt. Remind yourself of that each and every day.
- I wish I had known the value of interning at a startup before starting my own. There is so much I could have learned on somebody else's dime in a much lower-risk environment.
- You thrive in your career when you thrive with yourself.
- Speaking personally, as a first-time female founder, I would not be where I am today without an incredible network of fellow founders who have shared their challenges, advice, and hacks with me.
- By saying that leaders - male or female - have to look or act a certain way to be respected as role models, we are not only hurting those individuals but also reinforcing rigid benchmarks for the next generation of passionate, aspiring leaders, who are watching.
- Your energy is a barometer for your passion.
- From a professional standpoint, our transformation of the labor landscape at scale through technology with Levo is the highest and best direction of my energy.
- If what you're doing today is moving you closer to your passion, then that's wonderful.
- You kind of get the same adjectives coming back over again and over again describing millennials. I think the national rhetoric around this generation is unfairly negative.
- There's nothing worse for a mentor than being asked generic questions that anyone could answer. They want to ensure that their time is having an impact on you.
- You need to be really great at your job. You need a strong network of peers, and you need a strong network of mentors.
- Your style can be an artistic part of your personal leadership journey.
- The failures that you beat yourself up over are the ones where you experienced warning signs and can connect the dots backwards after the fact.
- Your morning sets up the success of your day. So many people wake up and immediately check text messages, emails, and social media. I use my first hour awake for my morning routine of breakfast and meditation to prepare myself.
- Be the best you can be, but acknowledge that you will make mistakes, and then know which errors to let go of. There will be typos in e-mails, meetings you are late for, daily to-do lists that don't get completed. Cut yourself some slack and, more important, reward yourself along the way.
- I was told by people who wanted to 'help' me that, although I had checked the box on the skills they wanted to see in the quarterly evaluation, they thought that I might want to cut my long hair so that I looked less young.
- You're a smart person. You're going to figure out where you can be more effective and more efficient with your own resources, and that's going to put more of an investment and emphasis on your future.
- Don't let the good days get to your head, and don't let the bad days get to your heart.
- Impostor syndrome, or feeling like a fraud at work, at home, or anywhere else in your life, will probably affect you at some point.

- Especially in the first 10-15 years, your regular resume is not an authentic representation of you - you don't really have that many notches on your belt, so to speak. In a super-competitive job environment, you need to be able to tell a multi-dimensional story about who you are as a person.
- I would encourage everyone in their first job not to ask themselves, 'Where do I want to be?' but 'What do I want to learn from this?' Use that opportunity to be a sponge.
- It's a must to continually stay alert and aware because ideas come from everywhere. And beyond relying on your fine-tuned radar to pick up on the next inspiration, consider seeking mentors.

- I've always known I've wanted to build companies that have a social impact.
- I have always been fascinated by entrepreneurship.
- I would encourage women to think about leaders in different fields or companies who they can draw parallels with. For example, I am constantly studying the lives and lessons of leaders in fields outside of technology, from the arts to politics. There is always something to learn.

- I begin to cut myself off in a digital shutdown at about 10 P.M. Phone, laptop, and iPad go down. If I'm at home, I'll leave my laptop and iPad in the living room. Those things don't go into my bedroom at all.
- Power is the agency to effect change, pure and simple. The more power you have, the clearer and less frictional the trajectory from an idea in your mind to its birth in real life.

- Ultimately, nobody can decide for you that it's the right moment to quit your job, just like nobody can decide for you that it's the right moment to fall in or out of love.
- I'm nicknaming millennials 'the purpose generation' because we're making so many decisions.
- There's this pressure to perform in your twenties - I think it comes from this whole generational foreshadowing that presumes there will be a whole other layer of things to worry about in your thirties.

- The most important thing that I did was to actually take the time to sit down every month and do a review of what I spent and look at it objectively.

- Believe in yourself. You are enough.
- The issue of women in the workplace is not a women's issue: it's an economic problem.
- A smile and good energy. They will take you farther than any material possession.
- When you dive into being an entrepreneur, you are making a commitment to yourself and to others who come to work with you and become interdependent with you that you will move mountains with every ounce of energy you have in your body.
- I used to think I was a night owl. I realized I'm not, because I have energy at night, but I'm not as focused and productive when I try to get things done.
- When you experience difficulty at work or in your life, instead of looking back on it as something that was really challenging, look at it and ask yourself, 'What wisdom did I learn from that?'
- The big experience of feeling like I jumped off into the deep end was that transition from college into the workforce. There were so many unwritten rules I didn't understand.
- After graduation, I discovered that I'd hit the limit of what I could learn from the women in my family. On top of that, in the workforce, all of the things that mattered in college suddenly weren't enough.
- The fact that millennials are fast at communication and expect transparency and don't feel comfortable with hierarchy gets interpreted as us being impatient or entitled. These traits are perfectly normal given that we're the first digital natives.
- A skill is something that you aren't inherently talented at and that isn't an effortless action, the way your thinking talents might be, but is something you can become excellent at nonetheless.

- We are very committed to highlighting women succeeding in entrepreneurship or technology.
- A mentor is someone who is willing to give you advice that isn't in the best interest for them. It takes a real mentor to put you first.

- I have a million career weaknesses, and although it's uncomfortable, I believe that authentically acknowledging and working through your vulnerability is more powerful than the delusion of perfection.
- We live by our values at Levo. We began by surrounding ourselves with passionate, values-driven people who had their intentions in the right place, and learned that like attracted like.
- Levo is Latin for 'to polish' and 'elevate,' and the name is essentially connoting the fact that we are coming together as a community to mutually enhance each other's lives.

- I first began to realize that it was time to leave my job when the sight of my manager's telephone number on my screen made my heart contract and burn.
- It can be very challenging to be what you can't see. Think about it in the physical world. You walk into a room, and no one looks like you. Can you relate to them? Do you feel welcome? Let's stop talking about how men dominate the technology industry and instead focus on the women who are killing it.
- Our members are constantly telling us that the guidance they received from Levo's mentors has helped them negotiate a raise, ask for more responsibility, build their resume, and more.
- Run focus groups. Do whatever you need to do to get 8 to 10 people together in a room and put your product in front of them. Ask them how much they would pay for it and whether they would pay for it. It's really important to get user validation early and often.

- The way in which you accomplish your goals and help your customers needs to be very flexible depending upon how those customers are reacting in real time.
- In high school, I interned at my mother's restaurant and learned the small-business ropes. It was really instructive and taught me to switch contexts quickly, as I contributed to everything from managing the reception desk to building their website.
- Whenever you have to figure out things that aren't explicit, like in salary negotiations, you see differences in how women and people of color succeed.
- Fashion doesn't boost my confidence - rather, it provides a canvas to express or reflect it and whatever is influencing me in my life at the moment.
- When faced with an obstacle or uncertainty in your abilities, use it as an opportunity to grow your talents.
- Men are much more likely to make sure the boss knows they were in the office until midnight. But women tend to avoid seeking that kind of acknowledgement for their work. They just assume that the boss knows - but the boss usually doesn't. I experienced that firsthand.
