quotes = ['''I am the first female chief executive of Hong Kong.''' ,'''We should continue to grow our economy and create employment opportunities, particularly quality jobs to help the upward mobility of young people.''' ,'''Fashion design is an important part of the creative industry that means the most to women.''' ,'''Laws, especially those of a constitutional nature like the Basic Law, which have been formulated through reasonable legislative processes, should never be freely interpreted or lightly abandoned.''' ,'''Hong Kong is not an independent entity... and cannot decide, on its own, its political development.''' ,'''Given the relativity concept, poverty cannot be eliminated. Indeed, an economic upturn with a broad improvement in household income does not guarantee a decrease in the size of the poor population, especially when the income growth of households below the poverty line is less promising than the overall.''' ,'''I have a husband at home who doesn't care about politics or global affairs.''' ,'''I am confident the SCMP and Hong Kong will continue to grow and prosper, hand in hand, in this 21st century of opportunity.''' ,'''I'm fine with criticism against me.''' ,'''Instead of wasting time on proposals which are difficult to forge consensus on, such as public nomination and party nomination, it's better to focus the discussion on how to form the nominating committee and the nomination process.''' ,'''In my opinion, serving the common good is the true purpose of politics and is also the perspective through which our community should consider constitutional reform.''' ,'''During the formulation of policies, we encourage discussion and listen. We should canvass opinions from all sectors of society - especially relevant stakeholders, those who work on the front line, and the youth - with a view to seeking consensus in society.''' ,'''With universal suffrage, every chief executive candidate must face the seven million people of Hong Kong, explain his or her political platform and mission, and win over the people by addressing their interests and concerns.''' ,'''If the chief executive cannot have a party background, how can she ensure her team is wholeheartedly united?''' ,'''In the back of my mind, always, is the firmly held belief that public policies must serve the long-term interests and well-being of the community at large.''' ,'''I believe the absolute majority of Hongkongers have never felt that Hong Kong independence is a viable option.''' ,'''I do believe Hong Kong's 5 million eligible voters want the chance to elect their chief executive.''' ,'''It is my earnest hope that all parties across the political spectrum will bear Hong Kong's long-term interests in mind, apply their political wisdom, and seek a consensus through open and rational communication with people of different views.''' ,'''Nobody wants a stalemate in constitutional development.''' ,'''Our mission and task has always been to find a pragmatic balance among competing interests that will serve the greatest common good.''' ,'''Real politics should work for the long-term and overall interests of the community.''' ,'''You have to understand that under One Country, Two Systems, we are a separate customs authority in the same way we are a separate member of the World Trade Organization.''' ,'''Now, walking in the streets, people seem to have become richer and more willing to consume. It seems like everybody is ushering in a better future. This has given me great satisfaction and driven me to do more.''' ,'''I set very high standards, normally for myself. For other people, I try to lower my standards.''' ,'''We should strive to be the most sophisticated and efficient platform for the world to do business with the mainland and for Chinese enterprises to be connected with the world.''' ,'''I grew up here with all other Hongkongers. My love for this place has prompted me to make many personal sacrifices.''' ,'''Any proposal that would usurp or water down the rights of the nominating committee would not be able to receive political support.''' ,'''Low rents mean families have more resources to improve their quality of life and invest in the next generation, facilitating upward mobility.''' ,'''We will value public engagement.''' ,'''We should widen our economic base and encourage businesses to move up the value chain and increase job diversity.''' ,'''Every day, I tell myself, 'It will be better if I spend more time on thinking about good ideas and working instead of watching TV or shopping.'''' ,'''A consensus on realising the goal of universal suffrage is not unattainable if we bear the common good in mind, move a step further, and try to resolve the differences or even stop insisting on some of one's own views.''' ,'''I firmly believe that the wider community supports achieving the goal of universal suffrage for 2017 according to law. I also believe most political parties do not want to see a failure to attain the goal.''' ,'''Facebook is actually very easy to use. It's not a difficult thing to me. I just write down a bit of my daily feelings.''' ,'''Although universal suffrage may not be a panacea for all social problems, it does have a profound bearing on the democratic development and governance of a place.''' ,'''I will comprehensively review the education system with my team to create a stable, caring, and inspiring environment for students, parents, teachers, and principals.''' ,'''Those who care about constitutional development should look beyond universal suffrage for the chief executive election and turn their sights to universal suffrage for Legco as well.''' ,'''When Hong Kong was under British administration, governors were dispatched from London to govern this city. We had no say in the matter.''' ,'''Relative poverty acknowledges that the definition of poverty should move with the times.''' ,'''I am very careful about my health... For example, I have body check-ups regularly and take some medicines to control my blood pressure, because I have a little bit high blood pressure.''' ,'''I think it's not just a matter of building more houses, more flats. We need to have the right policies. I want people to be able to own their flats.''' ,'''Some people advocate public nomination and a three-track system - allowing voters and political parties to make nominations along with the committee. These people do not want any screening of candidates, but they have not clearly defined the concept of 'screening.'''' ,'''I have hobbies.''' ,'''At the end of the day, we must respect the rule of law in respective jurisdictions.''' ,'''An affection for Hong Kong and a national identity are not mutually exclusive.

We have had some successes and some failures.''' ,'''It's impossible for the government to curb property prices.''' ,'''I think housing is not a simple commodity because we are so in short supply of land. So the government has a role to play in providing housing - decent housing and affordable housing - for the people of Hong Kong.''' ,'''If I paid more attention to my appearance, people might think that the proficiency of design industry isn't too bad in a city with such a chief executive.''' ,'''You cannot appreciate the sense of satisfaction that I get from my job.''' ,'''Let's face reality.

Specifically, the median monthly household income measures only income without considering assets.''' ,'''Implementing universal suffrage for the 2017 election is a big step forward along our road to democracy.

But some may possess assets, and they will be classified as poor. As such, the elderly poverty rate could be overstated.''' ,'''Sometimes, government officials and legislators disagree on policies or issues. Yet, we invariably want the best for Hong Kong people.''' ,'''Work is my top priority.''' ,'''I said before that I didn't care much about my popularity. But did I make use of it? Yes.''' ,'''We are not trained to please everybody.''' ,'''The SCMP, in short, reveals the renewed spirit of Hong Kong driven by my government - connect and excel - and in its passionate commitment to the community.''' ,]
