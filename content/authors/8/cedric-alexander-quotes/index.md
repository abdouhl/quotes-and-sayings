- I try to describe how I feel about this, about being closer and closer to the top of WWE, things like Madison Square Garden and to share a beer with 'Stone Cold' Steve Austin and to get a win over AJ Styles it's almost like sensory overload, everything is happening so fast.
- I was a big fan of Chris Benoit growing up. I was always a fan of usually the, I guess you can say the smaller, more athletic guys, I was a big fan of Mark Henry, but was more gravitated towards the cruiserweight type of guys.
- I loved Eddie Guerrero, Rey Mysterio, Rob Van Dam, I was a big fan of any of the big, flashy high flyers. They had that high flying, high intensity, and high impact style.
- I'll always learn something new, usually the small things that people overlook, those small nuances that can make you great.
- Superheroes have always been my thing. I've always loved their great allure, whether it's your traditional superhero like Batman or Superman, or even Greek Mythology, heroes like Zeus.
- For me, it's been a long road of growth. Not only as a performer but as a man, as a father and all that kind of stuff so at one point in my career I really just wanted to give up and hang it because I wasn't getting anywhere, I wasn't getting myself in good shape.
- When guys like Mark Henry, Paul Heyman, and Booker T all come up to me and tell me how much they appreciate my work and give me feedback on what to do better and how to improve myself it's honestly just scary.
- I modelled myself heavily after AJ Styles. I'm a huge AJ mark, so a lot of the things he does and the way he does them are very different as far as the fluidity and just his general athleticism.
- AJ Styles was a model for me, Chris Hero was a model for me, and to now realize that I am becoming that some mould is humbling.
- Now, with the Hurt Business, this is my chance to let loose. Before, when I was frustrated, I couldn't let it out. Sometimes being a bad dude just feels a lot better.
- Mustafa Ali has never beaten me in any way, shape or form. Singles match or tag team match, Ali has never beaten me, so that's part of why I'm so excited that he's decided to join Retribution.
- If there is a title to win, I want it.
- I feel like I've been given the golden ticket to success and there's no way I can mess it up.
- One of the things that made me love wrestling in general was my career in amateur wrestling in high school and college. Just being on the mat made me feel a type of aggression I wasn't really able to produce in my regular life.
- When I was in college and high school so I had it in my head that I can coach high school wrestling. Honestly, wrestling was my end all and be all, I had all my chips in that hat, that was it for me.
- I have anxiety about coming into the arenas all the time.
- I'm a huge Dolph Ziggler fan.
- When I was younger, I wanted to grow up and be the man that my father should have been, and I learned that by watching my mother.
- Long-term, I want to capture the WWE championship. I want to be a grand slam champion.
- I always looked up to my mother. My father was never around.
