The growth of the industry has always been in relation to the GDP (gross domestic product) growth.''' ,'''One thing I would say about the Indian consumer is that as much change and as much technology, innovation that you offer to the Indian consumer, the Indian consumer is very receptive and actually keep expecting more, and we have had that great experience.''' ,'''I use my interaction with both my kids to know how the youth today relates to technology, their expectations in terms of mobility and social solutions by customer services-oriented businesses like banking.''' ,'''Adaptability is a great asset to have because life is so unpredictable, and things can change overnight for any of us.''' ,'''Remember that relationships are important and have to be nurtured and cherished.

While we will do some unsecured loans - credit cards and personal loans - we will do it primarily with existing customers.''' ,'''As far as the banking industry is concerned - and I am sure it must be true for various industries as well - is that the only thing that is constant is change. Your business models are changing, the customer demands are changing and the regulations are changing constantly.''' ,'''The whole thing of moving the currency through currency sorting and detection machines and so on that was the whole process actually encouraging electronic transactions.''' ,'''What my parents believed was that, you know, the best wealth they could give to us children was to educate us and, you know - give us that foundation.''' ,'''India's growth drivers are actually two growth drivers.

I then ran the international side of the ICICI Bank for a few years.''' ,'''Punjab is central to our business strategy, and we are an active partner in the state's growth.''' ,'''Rather than worrying about entities, we should worry about the trends in technology that may cause disruptions... if we get so paranoid that banking is no longer going to exist and banks are going to get disrupted, I think that is a different worry.''' ,'''As we were growing retail, and it was a huge growth phase, it was very important to keep our quality under control. Therefore, it was not just distribution, not just back-office operations, but also the risk-management practices. And these we learned together, supported by technology.''' ,'''It's not easy to have it all. Frankly, you know, you have to give as much to the career that the career requires and, at the same time, you have to give as much to the family as the attention that's required.''' ,'''I have always said that a bank's lending rates do not only depend on rate cuts - it is just one signal.''' ,'''Only if you aspire for more will you achieve more.''' ,'''While working hard for my career, I looked after my family and have been there for my mother and in-laws when they needed me around.

I think the government is actually moving in the right direction.''' ,'''ICICI Group has always been a catalyst in India's growth and continues to support the country in every sphere.''' ,'''Even if it does not become cashless economy, it will become a less cash economy, and I think that itself is going to be a good and big achievement, and I think we are, as a country, gone through many of large changes, and ICICI has been a leader in many of them.''' ,'''In India, we have the opportunity to give innovation the kind of scale that no other country in the world can. Innovation is a necessity.''' ,'''When I moved from corporate to consumer banking, I brought a lot of synergy with me.''' ,'''I think it's important to celebrate your successes. It's important to feel happy about them, but it's equally important to look forward to the next big move.''' ,'''I had to create a team of people who had worked in this industry for other banks. What I brought to that team was ICICI's strategic thinking, but when it came to domain knowledge or product nuances, I had to learn from the team.''' ,'''When we in our sector talk of the adoption of Indian consumers to new products and innovative ways of doing banking, they always exceed our expectations.''' ,'''I always believe that, as you start out, while you should have a big dream - a big goal - but it's also important to move step by step. So, you know, frankly, if you ask me, when I started as a management trainee in 1984, I don't know that I really thought that I would become the CEO.''' ,'''There were so many occasions when I wasn't around for my kids or my husband. But we learnt to work around it.''' ,'''What we see is that we actually have digital channels through which the customers interact, but we also take the absolute brick channels, which is the branch, and convert that experience into a more digitised experience.''' ,'''The scope of activities for payments banks mainly includes acceptance of demand deposits, issuance of ATM/debit cards, payment and remittance services, and distribution of third-party products.''' ,'''Whenever there is a challenge, the key is not to get consumed by the challenge but actually to learn from it.''' ,'''When we look at the credit growth, we should look at it in its totality. Let us not only look at the non-food bank credit growth but also look at the growth across all the instruments of financing.''' ,'''I think competition is good. It finally delivers the best value to the customer, and I think it keeps all the players on their toes.''' ,'''If we look at India and the Indian demographics and the Indian consumer, I think the Indian consumer is going digital, social, and mobile. They want everything in a digital format, everything available on the go, and we socially connected.''' ,'''India did not innovate with the ATMs. But when we brought ATMs into India and made the machines talk in 15 regional languages to the people in rural India, we got millions of transactions on the ATM.''' ,'''Life comprises of both: opportunities as well as challenges.''' ,'''The issue of access to growth capital is common to all entrepreneurs. Any entrepreneur who can demonstrate a credible business model and plan would be able to access to capital.''' ,'''I think everybody wants GST.''' ,'''Mark-to-market losses are not real loss.
