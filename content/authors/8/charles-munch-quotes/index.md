Think for a moment of what it would mean to a pianist if by some miracle every key of his instrument should suddenly become a living thing.''' ,'''Music is an art that expresses the inexpressible. It rises far above what words can mean or the intelligence define. Its domain is the imponderable and impalpable land of the unconscious.''' ,'''The conductor must breathe life into the score.
