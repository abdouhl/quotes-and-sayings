- You can have the most emotional moment as an actor, ever, and many people would be like, 'Okay, cool. What's next?' You land one punch in a fight scene, and everyone is like, 'Yeah!'
- Daredevil's religion makes him unique. He's a vigilante, but he's also a lawyer - and all the while, he believes only God is capable of bringing people to justice.
- There is a horrible misconception that you can either act or not. But experience is everything.
- I'd love to see Peter Parker and Daredevil hang out. There's a wonderful issue of the comics where Matt Murdock has to defend Daredevil, because the public don't know, and so he has Peter Parker put on his Daredevil outfit so that he can sit in the docks. You know, great storyline.
- 'The Theory Of Everything' was a charming story, but I never dreamed it would turn out the way it did, winning all sorts of awards, and I don't think anybody working on it did.
- I don't think I resemble a superhero at all, really. I don't think people would really imagine me to be a superhero. I certainly don't have the physique for it, and I'm not tall enough, etc.
- What I like about fairy tales is that they highlight the emotions within a story. The situations aren't real, with falling stars and pirates. But what you do relate to is the emotions that the characters feel.
- One of the difficulties for me is that I'm naturally very skinny, so the problem that I have is trying to keep weight on, put weight on. I have to eat six, seven times a day, and I have to have a lot of carbohydrates to try and fatten me up so I have something to turn into muscle.
- I was at a school in England, a prep school, from the ages of 8 and 13. And every play they did was a musical. Parents love musicals. And I don't sing. It was driving me crazy. 'We're doing 'Macbeth.' 'Yes!' 'The musical!' And I was always in the chorus, because of course, in all the main parts, you had to be able to sing.
- If you want to play a complex, turmoiled character, then give him a dose of Catholicism.
- I really fell into drama school - I had a lot of lot of luck. I didn't take criticism very well while I was there; in fact, I took it personally. With every note I got, I felt like they were telling me I was a bad person.
- I'm really grateful for the opportunity I had on 'Boardwalk Empire,' just because it was very different than anything I'd done onscreen.
- I am incredibly self-deprecating. It stems from self-doubt.
- I love those moments in any movie or film where there's a reference to a bigger picture, especially in Marvel where everything is connected.
- My reaction when I hear the word 'celebrity' is, 'Who, me?' It doesn't feel like I'm famous.
- It's so easy to become obsessed with the film industry and recognition that we can forget that we are not saving the world. We are just actors trying to entertain people.
- I never don't know my lines. I never take the audition pages into the room. I end up relying on them or looking at them too much, and it makes me feel unprepared, so I always learn my lines without fail.
- Mark Rylance is one of my heroes. I saw 'Jerusalem' four or five times, twice in New York, twice in London.
- I'd love to play Spiderman, but I'm definitely too old for that role now.
- Daredevil was known as 'The Man Without Fear,' and I just thought, 'Well, I don't think that's very interesting.' I don't think it's very interesting to watch someone who's incapable of feeling fear. It also removes from the palate my favorite character attribute, which is courage. If you're not afraid, you can't exercise courage.
- I grew up Catholic, and when you've grown up, and these belief systems have been presented to you at a young, impressionable age, I don't know that you can shake them. Even if your rational mind tells you something else, sometimes they're so deeply ingrained that they are with you for the rest of your life.
- I think the danger is to try and please everyone.
- Of all the London theatres, the Donmar is the dream.
- There are elements to my faith which are echoed very closely in the scripts that come through. I read certain moments, and I'm able to say, 'Yes, I recognize that. I champion that. I ally myself to that idea.' Then there are times where I don't. My feeling is, at this stage in my life, that it will be an ongoing struggle.
- I think that Matt Murdock, the way he kind of holds himself, he's quite sensible at times, and he's quite serious. I think he would admire Captain America - not that he wouldn't admire Iron Man, but I think he probably be a little put off by his grandiosity.
- I left Britain in the mid-1990s when TV was going down the cundy - another good Dundee word - because I wanted a film career. But as I get older, I find myself being drawn back to my roots, and I'm loving it.
- It was weird. Like, people came up to me and knew me as Daredevil before any footage had come out. I remember a guy on the subway being like, 'You're Charlie Cox. You're Daredevil.' And I was like, 'Yeah...?' I was barely Daredevil. I hadn't even signed the contract, you know?
- I'm a London lad, but I'm fascinated by America. I want to take a motorcycling trip across the country and see those wide open spaces.
- Fame terrifies me. I can say that with honesty. You're terrified that, when people know the real you, they won't like you.
- One of the great things about playing a fallible superhero, one who doesn't necessarily have superpowers, is that the stakes are raised by the prospect of them perishing.
- Sometimes you think about the job that we, as actors, do. I take it very seriously, and I care very much about it, but I'm paid to make believe. When you're a kid, you go to your friend's house, and it's, 'Let's pretend we're both cowboys!' Without belittling it, that's basically what I do - I tell stories.
- Claire Danes is lovely and a really great actress.
- When you get to set, you don't try to play the plot; you just play the character.
- The great thing about doing a play is you get this rehearsal period, which you don't get with most film and television roles.
- I love New York, but I have to admit that I feel very English, and I do miss that sense of history that you have everywhere in Britain.
- There's something very special about seeing history so clearly in front of you through that architecture that you just don't get in the U.S. If I was asked to choose where I'd most like to live, I would always choose London.
- I don't feel comfortable with the glorification of violence. But, as an actor who has had long periods of unemployment, you have to be lenient with your convictions.
- I've struggled for confidence and had great doubts about myself. But, personally, I'm not riddled with guilt.
- I didn't grow up on comics, and I read very few.
- I don't think I make decisions as an actor based on what I think the fans will or will not want at this point.
- I'm grateful I know what it's like to be unemployed for long periods of time.
- I love to do cardio. I like to run and sweat a lot, and I think that's quite helpful.
- I've gone through long periods of time when there's no work for me. You wait for the next job to come along, and when it does, there's never a consideration about whether you do or don't do something.
- With every job I watch, I can't find peace with what I've done. It's never good enough in my mind. I will never be happy if I'm in that mindset, unless I get a review that starts: 'Once in a generation.'
