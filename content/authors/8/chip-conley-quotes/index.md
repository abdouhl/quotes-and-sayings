The more you can show them this control, the easier it is to tap back into the creative side of the brain that allows people to see possibilities and options.''' ,'''I don't know about you, but I've saved cards that old high school flames wrote me as well as those that employees have written me over the years. The power of genuine, customized appreciation will never lose its value, even in a gloomy economy... in fact, it's probably what we're all thirsty for in this desert of a depression.''' ,'''Business principles are only as good as the practices that back them up.''' ,'''Someone could be amazing at what they do, but if you don't like them, why bother hiring them?''' ,'''Once you know the emotional building blocks of anxiety, you can influence them.''' ,'''Daniel Goleman has proven that two-thirds of the success in business is based upon our Emotional Intelligence as opposed to our IQ or our level of experience.

It's the most important, neglected fact in business.''' ,'''When people get into that fight-or-flight place, then they move away from the creative centers of their brain.''' ,'''Feeling good about your life, but not expressing a heartfelt 'thank you,' is like wrapping a gift for someone and never giving it to them.''' ,'''At the heart of great leadership is a curious mind, heart, and spirit.''' ,'''When any of us thinks of ourselves as a role model - whether that's as a parent being observed by their kids or a leader under the microscope of their followers - it creates a natural stepping up of how we carry ourselves and what we expect from ourselves.''' ,'''The companies we admire are like the people we admire: resilient, authentic, personable, collaborative, ambitious, and humble.''' ,'''I'd done my time in corporate America, from McDonald's making shakes to Morgan Stanley making deals and, yet, I felt awfully constrained by the uniform - not just my clothes, but how I felt I needed to conform - that a traditional job required me to wear.''' ,'''Great leaders help their people see how they can directly impact the company's objectives and their own personal goals.''' ,'''Social scientists have found that the fastest way to feel happiness is to practice gratitude.''' ,'''When the world is in the midst of change, when adversity and opportunity are almost indistinguishable, this is the time for visionary leadership and when leaders need to look beyond the survival needs of those they're serving.''' ,'''Companies and leaders are role models - not just with the business community - but in the broader world.''' ,'''In general, I'm not much into etiquette and am a rule-breaker and rebel by nature.''' ,'''If an employee told you he had the flu, you'd send him home. If an employee told you he was feeling anxious, you'd probably tell him to get back to work. But the emotion is just as contagious as a flu virus.''' ,'''My life is scattered and busy. I think of my home as a resort. When I step through the door, I feel relaxed. I almost feel like I've taken a vacation.''' ,'''Every five years, I like to do a big birthday party. I had my 45th birthday with 75 friends in Marrakesh, Morocco.''' ,'''The intersection of psychology and business is typically seen as being as congested, stressful, and emotionally barren as a peak commute traffic day on the L.A. freeways.
