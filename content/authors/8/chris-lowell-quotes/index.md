- I will always be the hopeless romantic, more often pathetic than heroic.
- I learned so much about being an actor by being a director. More than I ever thought I would.
- I had managers approaching me in high school asking me if I wanted to act professionally, but to me, having to miss school to do that meant missing time with my friends, which was completely unacceptable.
- I am just pitifully nostalgic. I can't help but roll my eyes at myself frequently. I mean, I still shoot black-and-white film. And I am constantly reminiscing about the 'good old days.' I'm 28 years old. There haven't even been that many 'good old days.' But still, I love to look back.
- I really love diving in, head first, with directing and not having to worry about hair, makeup or lines.
- In 'The Big Chill,' those characters are in middle age, thinking, 'Oh, God, I've turned into my parents. I've failed.' And in 'Beside Still Waters,' we're showing the struggles of people who actually want to be like their parents and feel they can't live up to their heights.
- Kristen Bell is one of my best friends. I've had the pleasure of working with some really great people, and Kristen is just a beautiful, talented young lady.
