- I'm now wearing suits on stage, so I've kinda stepped up my game as far as image. Which I have to admit is kind of a pain the butt, but it's fun. It gives you a certain amount of confidence to walk on stage and look nice, but I can't say that I'm totally buying into the whole image factor.
- You just want to hone your craft, whatever it may be.
- I mean, I have a daughter, and it's a very bad message to send to my daughter that to be valid or accepted or to have value, you have to look a certain way. It's all about appearance, and not about education and not about contributing. I think we've completely lost our way.

- People say, 'How's the record doing?' In the old days you'd say, 'We're at 600,000, it's doing great.' You don't say those things anymore. Those numbers are gone.
- If you can't play it on an acoustic guitar or a grand piano then it's not a song.
- I think MTV put a huge dent in the songwriting craft.
- I think too many artists from my era tend to just stamp out a record.
- I mean, it's pretty disillusioning for all of us right now, and we feel pretty helpless when Congress, their approval rating is thirteen percent, and across the board, whether you're a Democrat or a Republican, you sort of want to walk in and fire everybody.
- You got to fight for quality art and equality and all the things that we're fighting for, the things we believe in. Choice and preference and all those things that we support. We don't want to give up that fight. You got to keep doing it.
