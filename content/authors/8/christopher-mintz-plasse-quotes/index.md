- I worked with Seann William Scott on 'Role Models,' and his arms are tatted up. He had to come to set an hour-and-a-half early to get them covered. It's not worth it. I want that extra hour of sleep.
- I had been doing all my school plays, elementary school, middle school, and high school, and then summer. I'd wanted to act for a long time, and I thought I was going to go to college and do theater, go that route. But 'Superbad' kind of fell on my lap. I was very, very lucky for that.
- I think the thing about acting and making music is that it's easy to do both. I'll shoot a movie for three months, and then I won't have to work for however long I want to. So, I can do a movie for a couple of months and then come and do music for a couple. But whatever's hot at the moment is what I'll gravitate toward.
- It's awesome, because in live-action, most of my comedies have been rated R, so I'm trying to make adults laugh. While animation is a completely different world where you're trying to make children laugh. So that difference is a blast to do.
- I was playing baseball, and I tripped over first base - I'm very clumsy - and I fell and broke my wrist. That was pretty painful.
- In animation, no one gets to see your face, so you can really mess up with your voice like I did 'ParaNorman;' I was a bully in that, which was so much fun to do. In 'How to Train Your Dragon,' I'm a little Viking character. So, it's kind of exciting to play these roles that you normally wouldn't get to play in a live-action movie.
- How can the human race be, like, the only living form in the universe? There have to be other life forms out there. I believe it.
- I met Chad Smith of the Red Hot Chili Peppers. I'm not really star struck by actors, but musicians, that's when I get star struck. Chad Smith is my number one drum influence, so that was a real mind-blow. I spoke to him - proper English, thank God!
- I never got a chance to take advantage of 'Superbad' at school because I graduated before it came out, so I never got to use any of my fame to pick up girls and go to cool parties.
- 'Superbad' was my first movie, but I've been acting since I was seven.
- The Weezer 'Blue' Album is a classic. I think My Morning Jacket's 'Circuital' is a great album to have. Any Led Zeppelin album. Pink Floyd 'The Dark Side Of The Moon' or 'Animals.' I always catch myself at concerts being like, 'Oh, I just stared at the drummer for 15 straight minutes.' I study them.
- When I was 16, at night I went to my high school and chucked rocks at the billboard sign and broke the light bulbs. That was fun.
- Stoller is one of my favorite comedic directors - one of my favorite directors that I've worked with to date.
- I was Aladdin, and then I was Captain Von Trapp from 'Sound Of Music' when I was 7 or 8, and then King Arthur. I was always the lead. I've always enjoyed being onstage, acting obnoxious, being someone that wasn't me, hiding behind a character.
- I just love doing movies that I would want to see in theaters.
- I never really think about what people are going to think of the movie afterwards. Or what people are going to call me. I just want to make a great project, and my focus is really all on that. And then I really don't read reviews. Like, you know, go on comment boards or anything.
- I can shoot a three pointer in basketball, and I can kick a soccer ball.
- There's no real downside to any sort of work that I do. I'm all so grateful for it, but I wouldn't say that animated work is just a walk in the park. It is easy, it's really fun, but I don't know why I really stress myself out every time I'm about to go in.
- I was never really a nerd. I'm not really into comic books or Dungeons and Dragons or any of that kind of stuff. I was in drama class, and I'm a big movie and music buff. And I'm into sports.
- It's an honor when someone writes for you. That means they can hear your voice in their head.
- I do love horror movies, but I'm not the kind of guy who would dress up as a ghoul for Halloween. I might go as a member of the Blue Man Group.
- I'm just glad I've had these opportunities to be geeks in some really awesome movies.
- My first ever sex scene in a movie was in 'Superbad.' Because I was 17, for legal reasons my mother had to be on the set. It was real awkward, but it worked out OK because when I watched the movie with her, the sex scene wasn't awkward because she'd been right there when it happened.
- I'm a big Tom Hardy fan. He dresses pretty stylish, right?
- I'm a guy who's passionate about singing, but I can't sing for crap.
- I just hated school. I don't like to learn. Don't teach me anything!
- People still remember Sean Penn as Spicoli from 'Fast Times At Ridgemont High,' and if I can have, like, one-10th of his career, then I'm fine.
- There are days I like going out, and days I like to sit naked with the remote control on my thigh, watching 'Breaking Bad.' I'm in love with that TV show. And 'Louie' on FX. And 'The Newsroom' - well, I don't know if I like it, but I'm obsessed with it. It's so Sorkin-y. But I've got some friends on there, so it's good to support them.
- One of my favourites is 'American Beauty.' Spacey is so good in that.
- My favourite word? I think, delicious, because it sounds so delicious. You say it, and you just wanna eat a chocolate bar.
- I have very young looks, so it's easy for me to play high school, but I'm trying to stay away from high-school movies. As I get older, I'll try and broaden my talents.
