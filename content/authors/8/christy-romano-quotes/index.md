- In my heart of hearts, I know that whatever I do is going to have integrity, and I'm going to work really hard, and I know that fans are going to take to it.
- I just got a body wave because I wanted it to look good when it was down.
- Because I'm not trying to throw people any curves.
- That's just the way this business works. You're a reliable commodity.
- Just like Tim Robbins is very political - and obviously, Arnold Schwarzenegger must be - I want to be able to have this public personality that's considered authoritative.
- And I'm working with all these great people at Sony Publishing.
- I usually shop at Charlotte Ruth and Bebe.
- I gotta get working, you know? I've been too busy. I've been trying my hardest, but it's really tough.
- But first I want to get my master's degree at Columbia's School of International Public Affairs.
- Developing a series is a next step for me.
- You don't need really expensive clothes to look cute.
- At this point, I can't say what network would be picking it up, but I know that it would be a success.
- But it's a Broadway show, so even if you're Christine in Phantom, you're still a princess. All female leads are princesses whether they're Disney princesses or not.
- I also never went there when I was little because I was too busy working and traveling on national tours.
- And after I make a lot of money, I'll be able to afford running for office.
- The cool part about working for Disney is that they've allowed me to be a change agent.
- You know, I'd love to do a Maxim shoot. But I'm not going to do it, because that's just stupid to do.
- I think I'm going to put together a compilation under Disney's name of my songs that I've done for them - because I've done six or seven by now! The latest was for the Princess Diaries 2 soundtrack. So that's the next thing that's coming out.
- So I'll go eat places and then I'll run it off in the show.
- I'm recording an album. It's sort of techno mixed with garbage - you, know, intense in-your-face music.
- So a lot of me is still a little kid, and I think that kind of helps alter my sense of reality - it makes me able to just become Belle every single night.
- While I'm trying to be different, I'm trying to be very conservative at this point in my career.
- So that's what's going on right now, and I'm looking to put out an album within the next six months.
