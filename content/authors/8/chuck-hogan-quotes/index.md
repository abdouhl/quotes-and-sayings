- Books and movies are never finished, only surrendered.
- The beautiful thing about 'The Strain Trilogy' is the ability to move from gore to high fable to creeping dread to domestic drama to unbearable suspense to the uncanny and on and on. The epic journey is designed to support these swings in mood, and that complements my tastes, which are wide-ranging.
- In my formative years, I never missed the 'Creature Double Feature' on Saturday afternoon TV, even if it meant switching back and forth between 'Gamera' and the Red Sox. I did a book report on Stephen King's 'Night Shift' in seventh grade. Unrated Italian horror movies became a weekly rite of passage once I hit seventeen.
- I was a huge horror fan, especially in my teenage years. Back then, there were a lot of Italian horror movies - some zombie, some just really strange movies that made no sense. I was really into shock and gore.
- I love my Kindle, but there are many books that I need to physically own. I think having the choice makes all the difference. Instant gratification - buying a book digitally and owning it sixty seconds later - really is a revolutionary act.
- Dracula appeared at a time of great technological revolution, utilizing telegraphs, typing machines, and blood transfusions.
- One pleasure of working on a trilogy is watching characters warp and grow over time.
- Anything you can do to stay organized and free up the creative side of your brain is a good thing.
- I respond to authenticity and originality, and I've been a fan of Don Winslow's ever since 'The Power Of The Dog.'
- I think bookstore browsing will become more cherished as time goes on because it can't be replicated virtually.
