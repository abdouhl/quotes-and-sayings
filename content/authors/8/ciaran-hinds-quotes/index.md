- I do believe as human beings we are a great mass of contradictions.
- When a play is really cooking, there's nothing like it.
- To be quite honest. I have seen a few things in 3D, and it didn't involve me anymore than when I saw something in 2D.

- Most of the work that I have done for the American Hollywood things have not been in Hollywood. The studios are going out in Europe or around the place working.
- That's why Tennessee Williams was a great writer. Poetically, dramatically, it was fantastic stuff. And with the landscape, the losers in life populating it. His short stories have got rhythm, something musical about them.

- I'd never really been in a series, where you see a man at different points and perspectives in his life. Usually it's a film, where I'm playing a character who just comes in and offers something up.
- In good comedy, the structure comes from truth and that weird eye that looks at the way life is.
- My father was a GP; my mother was a teacher and amateur actress. My father was a bit of a storyteller, but the acting influence must have been from her - yes, put it down to my mother.
- I've never traveled to promote anything I've been in. I've only been to about two or three premieres. The way I work, I do bits, and then I'm off to something else, whether it's theater or another project.
- I'm not a comic person at all. It never reached me in the north of Ireland, in the '60s and '70s growing up. We used to get stupid comics like 'The Topper' and 'The Beezer,' things like that.
- You know, Christianity has its own superstition anyway: Why you turn three times, what this saint means, why you pray to the patron saint of lost causes, why you go this way or that way.
- I float from one project to another project, so you miss people and you don't see them for years.

- I know I don't go looking for directors. I always wonder why they chose me.
- Grief is exhausting. When you learn - maybe through my age or experience - trying to harness the energy, whatever it is, muted energy or a concentration to find yourself in a place? You try to use it for when it's really necessary and can arrive.
- The joy of just being involved in something, of being part of a big process, just as a human being, it's nice to be part of people who are in the same enterprise, heading for the same goal, rather than, 'Oh this is all about me and my role. The story's about me.'
- Sometimes, there's not an honest engagement of Ireland in Hollywood movies.
- No nation can claim, 'We are an uncorrupt nation, therefore we will tell you what the morals of democracy are.'
- I've got a wonky nose. Is it classical, is it not? That's what's hard work, getting down into the nitty-gritty of who are the human beings behind the front of what they present?
- Christianity has its own superstition, anyway: Why you turn three times, what this saint means, why you pray to the patron saint of lost causes, why you go this way or that way.
- Casting is very, very important.
- You try to work with the director and your fellow actors to get somewhere, but other people are the judge of whether you hit that note right.
