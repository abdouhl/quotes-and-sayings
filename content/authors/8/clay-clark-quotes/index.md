You have to begin with the end goal in mind, knowing that a goal is a dream with a deadline.''' ,'''To be a proactive person, you must learn to say no to most ideas and opportunities so you have the mental and physical bandwidth to execute the realistic business plans you have already mapped out.''' ,'''When Jack Welch was the CEO of General Electric, he was able to produce record growth year after year by using a few simple principles relentlessly.

Learning and understanding the principle of the mastermind philosophy of networking can increase the value of your network and your net worth.''' ,'''With the help of personal introductions by Andrew Carnegie, diligence and an absolute burning desire to teach the world how to become successful, Napoleon Hill devoted nearly his entire adult lifetime creating practical content entrepreneurs need to become successful.''' ,'''Big successful corporations have established their own culture by the time you come along, so you have as high of a chance of changing their overall culture as you have of convincing the U.S. Marines to adopt the 'long-haired look' as their standard military haircut.''' ,'''You must not let your negative emotions distract you from achieving your goals.''' ,'''Have you ever noticed some people are able to stay organized while getting a massive quantity of work accomplished, while others appear to be busy but never actually produce results? Time management is the key to becoming a successful entrepreneur.''' ,'''Your to-do list should include items that need to be accomplished for the month, the week, and each day. You must then ask yourself how much time you need to block off to achieve each task. Time blocking allows you to minimize distractions and to maximize your efficiency as you work to complete this list.''' ,'''Because most startups are lean and scrappy organizations consisting of a limited number of people and supported by an even smaller number of resources, startups cannot afford to have any slackers on board. When you fail, you cause an 'epic failure,' and when you win, everyone in the company knows about it.''' ,'''To not run a venture into the ground, entrepreneurs need to learn what it takes to succeed.''' ,'''If you find yourself feeling overwhelmed by the daily decisions you have to make, it's time to automate something.''' ,'''If you can't sell your product, it goes from being an asset to a liability. Learn to sell, partner with someone who can sell, or learn to be poor.''' ,'''It is important to let every employee know where he or she stands throughout his or her time in your business; I would suggest every quarter of the fiscal year.

I relentlessly implement the best ideas into my businesses.''' ,'''You must bring a white-hot level of intensity and focus to your work.''' ,'''In the startup work environment, you get to have a relationship with your boss, the investors, and the key members of the team. Startups are like families - you see the good, the bad and the ugly, but in the end, you've got each other's back.''' ,'''Keep a Day Timer so you know where you are supposed to be and when. Whether this system is in a tangible, printed version or on your mobile device, by having a Day Timer, you can stay organized throughout the day.''' ,'''We can have all of the best ideas in the world, but if we do not have a system to get our tasks completed, we will fail.''' ,]
