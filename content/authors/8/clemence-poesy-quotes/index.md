- I never hire a stylist.
- I knew fashion was going to be part of my job, so I thought I might as well have fun with it.
- I just wear jeans, big motorcycle boots and T-shirts that are way too big for me. I like anything that has lived a little bit, that has traces of life on it. Knitwear that's a tiny bit too long because you've pulled it with your hands, or jeans that are starting to get holes.
- I'm never anywhere for more than three weeks.
- I think it is important to pass on the message to young people who are going through a difficult time with friends that it will pass.

- I actually don't trust anyone who tells me they don't like New York.
- I had a grungy period and looked like a tramp for a very long time - my mum really hated it! I destroyed her entire '70s wardrobe by putting studs into everything - I thought I was really cool. But it's good to experiment - I even had dreadlocks at one point.
- I love fashion, and I've always wanted to do costume design, but I'm in jeans and T-shirts most of the time.

- I think denim is something everyone feels comfortable in. It's kind of my uniform, really.
- In the '80s, I was the only one who didn't watch the shows about teenagers. I had to go over to friends' houses to see them. I still don't have a TV!
- I think the people we meet in life and the loves of our lives are very, very important in what we become, like change us - when it's right, probably change us for the best.
- I don't know if I see myself as an actress for the rest of my life.
- If I ever get married myself, it'll be in jeans.
- There are very few actresses who can grow old and still get exciting parts... I think it's very important for me to have wider horizons, rather than just waiting for calls.
- I'm always so impressed with these actresses with their perfect make up and hair and sometimes I'm very aware that I'm not like that. But I don't think I can do things any other way. I would be wearing a disguise if I started to apply that stuff.
- When it comes to fame, I am in a very convenient position. I live a very normal life.

- I know London very well.
- Actresses are so spoilt - we have someone who does our hair for us on set, so we don't know how to do it ourselves in real life. I know how to wash my hair and brush my teeth, but that's about it!
- I used to spend hours at night, downstairs, in front of the only full-length mirror in the house, standing on the table working out what I would wear to school the next day.
- I'm always curious about anyone who has enough passion to go onstage and say, 'This is what I'm really passionate about.' It's always worth listening to.
