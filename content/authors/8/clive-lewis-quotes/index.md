quotes = ['''Most Labour members are genuine anti-racists who oppose antisemitism.''' ,'''In the U.S., requiring voters to produce photo ID in order to vote is just part of a much wider and more open system of discrimination against poor and ethnic minority voters.''' ,'''The values that underpin Nato are social democratic values: liberty, democracy, freedom of expression.''' ,'''My time as an MP has made me more aware of the power dynamics that exist in society: between men and women, between people of different backgrounds and ethnicities, between those in positions of power and those with very little of it.''' ,'''We must be open to creating alliances of progressive and socialist organisations on a local level, particularly given the undemocratic electoral system face.''' ,'''When I was growing up, my dad wore a lot of browns and greens - darker colours, autumnal colours. When I was on the BBC news trainee scheme, around the turn of the millennium, we had someone come in and talk to us about what you wear on television, and I was told that khakis, greens and browns went very well with my skin tone.''' ,'''We were the first country in the world to carbonise our economy and to reap the huge economic rewards that followed and it is right that we now invest some of that wealth in fully decarbonising.''' ,'''As in many British organisations, subtle institutionalised discrimination may well prevail. But in all my time in the army I've never experienced overt racism.''' ,'''My vision for the country is of warmth and energy. A country that starts every conversation and every project - either in business or politics - with a belief in the best in people. This is the hopeful creed of a 21st-century socialism.''' ,'''As an MP, it is my job to hold the government to account.''' ,'''A lot of people would like to see the monarchy scaled down.''' ,'''Changes that are being enhanced by technological innovation (social media being a case in point) are happening at an increasing rate.''' ,'''Ultimately, if BEIS fails in the historic tasks Theresa May has given it, we will all pay a heavy price.''' ,'''Frankly, I want to be in government with Caroline Lucas, not against her - and certainly not in permanent opposition.''' ,'''While as black people we've paid for our right to be in this country many, many times over, I still can't help but feel we psychologically still see ourselves as outsiders. I believe this is our country. As such we need to embrace it fully.''' ,'''I haven't come from a background where I've had it imbued in me from an early age that I'm destined to lead or to rule.''' ,'''Good businesses are the lifeblood of the economy. But, as responsible business people up and down the country know, the system too often allows good businesses to be undercut by bad.''' ,'''Chasing new runway capacity to cater to ever more frequent leisure flights by Britain's wealthiest households isn't just iniquitous - it's bad economic policy.''' ,'''In a liberal democracy rapid, radical and fundamental economic change must benefit the many not the few, if it is to gain popular, long-term political support.''' ,'''The U.K. could become a global leader in decommissioning skills and technology as we move to a net-zero-carbon economy.''' ,'''I don't consider myself a subject, I think I'm a citizen of this country and I think the vast majority of people consider themselves citizens.''' ,'''People have to remember that the armed forces do as democratically elected governments tell them to do. They don't arbitrarily go into countries and kick off. These are decisions that are made by our politicians.''' ,'''Climate change is a humongous challenge but it also presents numerous economic opportunities.''' ,'''Ultimately, Boris Johnson and the political and financial support behind his Brexit project are probably the biggest threat to both British democracy and the post-war welfare state settlement we've faced in the post-war period.''' ,'''Labour can and must offer hope: not the falsehood that it will do everything, but the real promise that it can help us help each other.''' ,'''With its brutal empire and legalised slavery, the Roman Republic was hardly a towering beacon of progressive values.''' ,'''Whether through the introduction of a Universal Basic Income, or through developing ways to ensure that the self-employed, entrepreneurs and fledgling start-up companies have the support they need to take chances and innovate, the Â£500bn investment programme proposed by Corbyn responds to the challenges we will inevitably have to face.''' ,'''Many of us mistakenly believe a coup d'etat is the only kind of coup possible. But a coup doesn't always require tanks on a lawn and senior ranking military types appearing on your TV and radio declaring that democracy as you knew it, is now over.''' ,'''Unanimous votes are rare in parliament.''' ,'''The creation of millions of secure, well-paid jobs must be at the forefront of any Green Industrial Revolution.''' ,'''I know what it's like to feel the fear of battle. To be constantly looking over my shoulder and thinking every sound might be a bomb or a bullet. When I served in Afghanistan in 2009 I felt that fear, but I made a choice to serve in the army and I knew I could come home to safety at the end of my tour.''' ,'''Boris Johnson tried to prorogue parliament to get his disaster of a Brexit through, bringing hundreds of thousands out onto the streets for the 'Stop The Coup' protests, and seeing his cynical strategy overturned by the Supreme Court in the process.''' ,'''The 21st century has more potential than perhaps any other in our brief evolutionary history. We stand on the cusp of computing, genetic and energy generation breakthroughs that were only recently in the realm of science-fiction. A golden age of humanity is tantalisingly within our grasp.''' ,'''Leadership and punching above your weight doesn't necessarily always have to mean gunboat diplomacy and bombing other countries into the stone age. It can actually mean leading by example, and helping other countries.''' ,'''I've got uncles who wore garish stuff, you know, electric blue polyester suits, and they carried it off. But my dad never went down that path, he has never been into loud stuff. His style was fashionable, but never sharp.''' ,'''No doubt relinquishing our nuclear arsenal would irritate Washington but what would the U.S. rather have, the U.K. able to assist in military operations or an ill-equipped conventional force and a nuclear arsenal which will never come into play?''' ,'''We can't grow as a party, if we're afraid of having difficult conversations.''' ,'''I don't want to manage the labour movement, I want to unleash it.''' ,'''Every time the Tories are in government, our democracy takes a battering.''' ,'''I know I have made mistakes, and I am grateful for those who both challenged me and gave me the space to grow.''' ,'''I'm a democrat.''' ,'''Poor people can't cut their emissions - they don't make them.''' ,'''During his time at BHS, Sir Philip Green treated the company as his own personal plaything. Instead of investing in its branches and developing its brand, he ran down the pension scheme and used the company to line his own pockets.''' ,'''I'd rather see us as citizens than subjects in the 21st Century.''' ,'''The top-down, vertical power relationships of the past are being replaced by a more evenly distributed, bottom-up variety.''' ,'''In his 40s, my dad refound his youth a bit, and started going to the West Indian club in Northampton, where I'm from, where the West Indian diaspora would go to socialise on a Friday night, and have a drink and a dance to soca and the like.''' ,'''In politics, sometimes, you dig your heels in and draw a line in the sand and refuse to compromise.''' ,'''For the vast majority of people in this country the reality of climate change is not in doubt.''' ,'''Understandably, the electorate places great faith in the professional soldiers and strategists that run our military.''' ,'''Poor people don't drive the toxic form of economic 'growth' that is destroying our environment.''' ,'''Labour can no longer impose a future on the country, instead it must negotiate one.''' ,'''Labour are determined to create a fair, sustainable tax system in an economy that works for everyone.''' ,'''It's sad to say, but the story of Royal Mail's privatisation is a story of our times: the loss of democratic control; the transfer of wealth and power to the richest in society; and the growing pressure on working people to work harder and faster for less.''' ,'''E.U. law provides agency workers with the right to equal treatment, and all workers with maximum working hours. It forces governments to take environmental legislation seriously, and to protect air and water standards.''' ,'''I'm in favour of more democracy - let the British public decide what the future of the monarchy is and what shape it should be.''' ,'''The 2017 general election showed how quickly support can skyrocket.''' ,'''There is nothing efficient about firms spurning more productive technologies because years of unrelenting attacks on social safety nets and collective bargaining have created cheap labour in abundance.''' ,'''Labour has a complex history with racism and internationalism. Political education about antisemitism and all forms of racism can help us reckon with that history, and ensure a socialist politics based on real equality becomes the common sense across the party.''' ,'''The U.K. government faces three choices to deal with carbon-heavy fossil fuels: force people to stop using them immediately; facilitate a rapid transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy; or hope business-as-usual market forces solve our problem for us.''' ,'''I'm fed up with the top-down style of politics, where discussion in our party is stifled because of sectarianism and tribalism.''' ,'''Liberation and equality will never come from the top down but through organising from the ground up, and our Labour movement has a crucial role to play in fighting for it.''' ,'''We know growing technological developments in artificial intelligence, automation and big data mean that democratic socialism in the 21st century must adapt to such a rapidly changing world.''' ,'''My feminist values are rooted in my socialist values. The number of women CEOs in Britain's biggest companies is irrelevant if they pay their women workers poverty wages or discriminate against black employees.''' ,'''We need to defeat not just antisemites but antisemitism.''' ,'''Putting a credible form of Brexit to the people and offering Remain as an alternative will give Labour the chance to unite as a party.''' ,'''The British public deserve real choices not forced, technocratic arguments about variations of the same dead end arguments.''' ,'''It's a travesty that there are people on this planet living on less than a dollar a day.''' ,'''Labour needs to lead - lead on Brexit, lead in Europe, lead for the people.''' ,'''Labour under Jeremy Corbyn is not afraid to take on the very wealthiest, committing to the most comprehensive anti-tax avoidance plan ever presented by a major political party.''' ,'''Central to being a humanist, which I am, is the core understanding that doubt and criticism are essential attributes in the quest for knowledge.''' ,'''Such is the sense of entitlement of Boris Johnson and his establishment class - they believe they can break the law without the consequences meeting ordinary people.''' ,'''When Jeremy Corbyn won the Labour leadership - not once, but twice - and defied the mainstream media's expectations to gain Labour seats in the 2017 election, it was no surprise to those of us who have always backed Corbyn and his agenda for change.''' ,'''A leadership competition is not an ideal context for honest reflection. The aim is, after all, to win, not to learn and build.''' ,'''Climate change is an existential threat to our economy, and ultimately to civilisation as we know it.''' ,'''To describe 'Mutually Assured Destruction' as an 'insurance policy' would be comical if it wasn't such an appalling concept.''' ,'''Political status does not necessarily depend on nuclear capability.''' ,'''At times of constitutional uncertainty and social division, parliament needs a greater, not a lesser role, in defining our future.''' ,'''On everything from climate change to the housing crisis, we need solutions that are credible, bold and radical.''' ,'''There is nothing efficient about destroying the planet as we know it because vested interests want to keep us addicted to fossil fuels.''' ,'''On their deathbed, do people think: 'I wish I'd spent more time with my Ferrari'? Or do they say: 'I wish I'd spent more time watching my kids grow up, I wish I'd spent more time country walking?' It's about the things that matter in life, and how we have an economy that better reflects that.''' ,'''Serving your country in the U.S. brings not just peer respect but also the chance to learn new skills and receive a college education. The U.K.'s armed forces offer a similar deal.''' ,'''The genius of the market is supposed to lie in its ability to allocate society's resources to their most efficient uses without central direction. Labour has long recognised that efficiency doesn't always correspond with what is socially optimal or, in other words, 'fair.'''' ,'''Tackling climate change can make us world leaders in burgeoning markets for green technology.''' ,'''In the 1980s, Thatcher hacked away at our trade unions and abolished the Greater London Council.''' ,'''I think many of the virtues and values of the army are very similar to the virtues and values of socialism, of the Labour Party. It's about looking out for each other, it's about working as a team, it's about understanding.''' ,'''It's obvious the Green Industrial Revolution will challenge orthodox political and economic thinking. That requires bravery from both politicians and electorates.''' ,'''History is littered with leaders and movements, now long vanished and mostly forgotten, who failed to get to the deep truths of how and why their defeat happened.''' ,'''Europe has been the Tory party's kryptonite for decades, sapping it of strength at key moments.''' ,'''Heathrow is conveniently located for airlines to shuttle the global elite between different routes. These flights disturb the peace of millions, disrupting lessons across west London and dumping toxic gases on people living around the airport. Their passengers don't pay a penny in taxes.''' ,'''I couldn't watch 'BP' for a long time, until I started doing this job, because I knew in my heart that 'Blue Planet,' as beautiful as it was, at the end they would always have the human impact, and I struggled to watch it because I felt so powerless.''' ,'''We are looking at ways to shift the balance of taxation away from work and on to the practices that are destroying the environment on which a healthy economy depends.''' ,'''Billionaire's shouldn't exist.''' ,'''Like many black people, I initially viewed the armed forces with a degree of suspicion.''' ,'''Parliament must do a better job at holding the Government to account than it managed in the Article 50 debates.''' ,'''The only time that Labour has convincingly come from opposition to win has been in 1997 in the post-war period. And to do that we had to tack quite substantially to the right.''' ,'''It is common to speak of the economic opportunities tackling climate change represents, and there is a lot of truth to this: rapid decarbonisation offers a profound economic opportunity to revive our productivity and reshape our economy as part of a green jobs revolution.''' ,'''My message to Thunberg and all of her British counterparts is simple: the Labour party's door is open. We hear you, and we will work with you to do what needs to be done.''' ,'''The need for heroes, to admire them, to be inspired by them, runs deep in our cultural and social make-up.''' ,'''I'm known for wearing tweed jackets, khaki pants and suede shoes. I've only worn a suit in parliament under duress, when I was on the front bench.''' ,'''I would like the Labour Party to issue a pamphlet to all its members explaining what antisemitism is. The pamphlet could go through each way that antisemitism manifests itself, point by point, explaining what each means.''' ,]
