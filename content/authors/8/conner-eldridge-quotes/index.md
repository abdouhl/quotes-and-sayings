quotes = ['''In 1994, the bipartisan Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) was signed into law to prevent and combat domestic violence.''' ,'''I will travel to all 75 counties in Arkansas every year, listen to your stories and concerns, and work hard every single day on the issues affecting you and your family instead of visiting exotic foreign countries on the taxpayer dime.''' ,'''We need to get big money out of Washington.''' ,'''I will not rest until seniors get the cost-of-living adjustments they have earned and we lower the cost of prescription drugs.''' ,'''Arkansas families need to feel safe in their homes and communities, which is why we need a U.S. Senator who will address threats - both at home and abroad - head on.''' ,'''You can bet I will work with anyone in either party to fight for our veterans and their families, and I will make sure they get the attention and care they deserve.''' ,'''Money is the root cause of why our political system is broken and why Americans are so frustrated.''' ,'''We must also recognize that the American Dream includes being able to provide and care for your family without fear of losing your job in the process.''' ,'''Democrats are just as wrong to insist the law is perfect, that the law doesn't have things that need to be fixed, and to pretend that the law did wave a magic wand and make everything in the health care system fixed.''' ,'''I am so grateful for the service our veterans have given to our country. These men and women put their lives on the line for our safety and security, and we need to honor their service and our commitment to them.''' ,'''Hardworking women are the foundation of Arkansas's success. But we must do more to ensure that all of our mothers, sisters, and daughters are protected and that they have the choices available to make the best decisions for them and their families.''' ,'''Caring for our veterans should be non-negotiable. And it definitely should not be affected by playing the same old Washington party politics game.''' ,'''As a prosecutor, I saw firsthand how VAWA has made a difference in the lives of women and girls by ensuring an aggressive response to domestic violence, boosting victims' services, and enhancing efforts to prevent and prosecute these horrible crimes.''' ,'''One such issue that Arkansans want action taken on is campaign finance reform. And this is a problem that is not really all that complicated.''' ,'''Working on domestic violence cases was an eye-opening experience that made me passionate to do everything possible to support and protect victims and prosecute abusers.''' ,'''Agriculture has deep roots both in my life and in Arkansas' history.''' ,'''All women should have the ability to get ahead with hard work, be treated fairly in the workplace, and live free from fear.''' ,'''We all share some commonalities with the states we come from and where we come from on the political spectrum. There's a lot of work to be done to make sure we continue to have strong advocacy for these values that we find in the heartland, in red and rural states.''' ,'''John Boozman has been traveling the world, making 129 visits to 53 countries during his time in Washington, and ignoring the real problems hardworking Arkansans are facing every single day. That is unacceptable.''' ,'''When I served as a prosecutor, I saw firsthand the many injustices that are embedded in our communities. But I also saw the difference it can make in someone's life when they have someone to stand up and fight for them.''' ,'''Some folks want the position of being a U.S. senator to enjoy the benefits that come with it, like foreign travel on the taxpayer's dime - which Sen. Boozman's done 129 times.''' ,'''Growing up, I watched my single mother work hard to provide for her three kids. She raised us in a one-bathroom house on a public-school teacher's salary of $22,000 a year.''' ,'''Our country has made a promise to our veterans: if you serve your country, then 'we've got your six.' We will have your back for life. I will always fight for the more than 250,000 veterans here in Arkansas.''' ,'''There is a disconnect between Arkansas and Washington, D.C. The career politicians in Washington are not listening to people here in Arkansas, and this is the fundamental problem with politics.''' ,'''As a senator, I will prioritize overturning the current system and restoring openness and integrity to our government to return power to the people.''' ,'''Arkansas needs leaders who will stand up to anyone in Washington, from either political party, and do what's right for Arkansas and for our country.''' ,'''Acts of violence that occur simply because of how someone looks are horrific.''' ,]
