I went as Wonder Woman and my mom even took me to get the costume.''' ,'''I'm just looking at other opportunities, television... not so much another existing reality show, but more about creating stuff.''' ,'''People who cling rigidly to gender binaries are more than welcome to. But for a lot of young people, we're seeing that our gender roles don't have to be dictated by a set of rules made by society. We can do whatever feels natural to us.''' ,'''I've seen attraction manifest itself in so many fascinating ways. Lots of straight-identifying men have been attracted to me as Courtney.''' ,'''For my teen years and all of my twenties it felt like I was trying to live up to this expectation of being a man and what that meant - not just what clothes I wore, but how I acted.''' ,'''I live in a bubble, but there have been times when my bubble has been burst.''' ,'''There is so much frustration in the heterosexual male community manifesting in different ways, whether it be aggression or sexism or racism. I'm not saying all heterosexual men are that way, but you do see a lot of it.''' ,'''I think it's so important to think about the basic human rights of others and to use our collective voices, minds and bodies to lift those people up and bring about change.''' ,''''The Bi Life' will show many stories.

We have such a rigid idea of what gay is and that's also problematic.''' ,'''I remember my first Mardi Gras. It was in the year 2001. I decided earlier that day that I was going to go in drag. It was my third time in drag.''' ,'''I genuinely had always thought, this sounds dumb, I always thought that 'RuPaul's Drag Race' was shot in the basement of RuPaul's house.''' ,'''I'm no Joan of Arc, but it's pretty revolutionary having a gender illusionist selling the illusion of beauty to females.''' ,'''Normally when you go to a queer space the people often look like you, they are the same age as you and so on, but at Mardi Gras and at queer events in general, everybody is different, everybody comes together. And that is what I love about Pride and Mardi Gras and those sort of events.''' ,'''There are gay people in every community, there are bi people in every community and they can come together with a bit of strength.''' ,'''The most vocal fans online are girls, which is interesting. I didn't expect that.''' ,'''Because bisexual people almost have a foot in the gay and the straight world, their friends can misunderstand them too.

It was the happiest night of my life.''' ,'''You can't really necessarily explain what being on a reality show is like until it's happening to you.''' ,'''It's important to acknowledge bisexual, pansexual.''' ,'''I just wanted to show young people you can be you and wear what you want.''' ,'''After Pride, Christmas is a drag queen's next best holiday.

I believe that once I die, that's it.''' ,'''It's a common misunderstanding, that when a bisexual person is dating someone of the opposite sex that they are now straight, or if they are dating someone of the same sex they are now gay.''' ,'''There's something problematic with this idea that straight men can be 'turned', and the binary of gay and straight and the lack of knowledge of the Kinsey scale.''' ,'''Being trans means different things to different people. Some people don't take hormones, some people don't have surgery, some people are just happy living in the clothes of their chosen gender.''' ,'''Pole dancing is way harder than it looks.''' ,'''I'm a big fan of Stormzy.''' ,'''Different people are attracted to me depending on how I look.

M.''' ,'''The thing about gay male pop stars is: they aren't supported by gay men. Gay men don't really support them until they've gone beyond the gay community and had success in the mainstream, so it's really challenging.''' ,'''I love New York audiences, because they're used to going to shows, and you really notice it. They laugh and applaud and do all the things that you want an audience to do.''' ,'''Changing genders is not a quick process... it takes about two hours to put on all the make-up and the lashes, and the hair, and the corsets, and the seven kinds of adhesives that work in tandem on my body to keep things up and keep things down.''' ,'''So many reactions in our lives are based on what happened to us when we were younger.''' ,'''When it all boils down, being Courtney has forced me to be different to the status quo, which means I have gotten to decide on every choice along the way.''' ,'''Russia is a very different place than what we in the West are familiar with. We cannot apply our own values and judgments to the country. We need to have greater compassion and understanding and recognize that our similarities are greater than our differences.''' ,'''Drag has taught me that I have deliberate control over my image, and when this notion is applied to one's whole life, it is both powerful and transformative.''' ,'''I know that the U.K. loves a villain.''' ,'''Drag can make you a little more fearless and I think girls especially love drag because they get to see somebody define their own standard of feminine beauty.''' ,'''The gay community has had a sometimes tumultuous relationship with non-queer people coming to their shows because it was tourism, like using the queer spaces as a form of comic relief or entertainment.''' ,'''I'd always been a performer, growing up in a theatre school.''' ,'''For people living with HIV, the knowledge that undetectable equals untransmittable is huge news, not only as a means of preventing transmission, but in breaking down the stigma that many people still experience.''' ,'''I am a Madonna fan.''' ,'''A good night's sleep is a super important part of feeling good.''' ,'''Often with bigotry it's passive not active.''' ,'''I was always made to feel that men were desirable because of their masculinity, and for a boy, being feminine was not something you should be proud of.

The fact that anybody could ever say or think that dressing in women's clothes is wrong, or odd. Women dressing in women's clothes and men dressing in men's clothes is the actually the thing that is really odd.''' ,'''Drag is more like a license to be what you want. But you don't need drag to do that.''' ,'''Call me old fashioned, but I love songs that end. As a songwriter, I feel like you put a fade out when you can't work out how to end a song.''' ,'''I just feel like, at any moment, a drag or a trans or a gender-diverse artist that doesn't fit in a box is ready to break into the mainstream. I want to do my best to put myself in the best position to have that happen for me.''' ,'''I know when there's lots of stuff racing around in my head it can be hard to sleep and stay asleep. And one of the biggest things that used to keep me awake at night was worrying about my gender and sexuality.''' ,'''Pride is a time to celebrate what makes us unique and the more we let young people know that those things that make us different are actually our greatest strengths, the more comfortable we are in our own skin and the more peacefully we'll sleep at night.''' ,'''I think it's really important to acknowledge that gay men and straight men can be friends.''' ,'''As I get older, I'm more comfortable with the idea of dying.''' ,'''Obviously drag has different intentions and my drag has always been about gender illusion.''' ,'''The Spice Girls and Fran Drescher were such important parts of my childhood. There was something about them that allowed me to be myself.''' ,'''Yeah, back in 2003, I went to 'Australian Idol' the first day as a boy, and I got knocked out. So I went back the next day in drag and made it into the Top 12 and got a record deal and toured around Australia.''' ,'''I would have hated for my 'Drag Race' moment to have come down to lip syncing a Whitney Houston song.''' ,'''As a drag performer, people have traditionally put us into the category of 'pervert' or 'deviant' or things like that. So I've always been really careful not to be vulgar or grotesque with sexuality.''' ,]
