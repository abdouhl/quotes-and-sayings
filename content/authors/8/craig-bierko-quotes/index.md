quotes = ['''Television shows, especially hour-longs, are hard, tiring work. Those people are very tired and very rich. But they're working really hard, and to create the illusion of having the time of your life like that, you really got to give it up to the people who do it.''' ,'''People love to be told stories, but it's the sugar that draws you into the theater.''' ,'''A lot of actors I had worked with seemed mentally unbalanced. It's only a matter of time before I go nuts myself.''' ,'''Naturally, I've always felt more like a writer myself, and I've always written. I have people who are writers who've been promoting that side of me. I also draw, too. Those things I feel most comfortable in.''' ,'''Any decision that's made about my career is ultimately my decision, and it's helped me not to plan too much. I've never been the guy thinking, 'I want to do a play this year, I want to do this kind of movie or this kind of character.' I don't have that sort of control.''' ,'''Before 'Cinderella Man,' I didn't box. But I boxed. It's possible. You go and you work hard at things.''' ,]
