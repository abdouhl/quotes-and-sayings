I look at Art Monk, I look at Lynn Swann, I look at Michael Irvin, and it's becoming very, very difficult to judge the skill of a wide receiver in today's game. But what else can you judge it on but the numbers? The numbers, they do tell a story.

And Randy, not like any other superstar I've met, he has more quit in him than any of those other players.
- I don't care what you do in life. To say that that year I was the absolute best, especially when you're in a team sport - and I have more of a personality that I wished I would've played an individual sport - to win a championship, to get 60 people and focused in one direction and do it over a seven-month period is phenomenal.
