- When I was early in my career, I really followed Twitter, seeing what people were saying about me. I definitely saw them talking about Mr. Mankato and all that. It was fun for me to have a little bit of extra support from outside people. I definitely helped me build confidence, that's for sure.

- I don't think it's much different at this level. It just feels like playing high school football, college football. It's the same games, the same routes.
- I love when people doubt me. I love when people don't think that I'm good enough to play at a certain level, not good enough to be a starter, things like that. That's the stuff that drives me.

- You know, the media always tries to twist things and make things into what they're not.
