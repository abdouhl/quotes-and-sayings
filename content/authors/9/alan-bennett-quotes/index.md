- Life is generally something that happens elsewhere.
- I'm less genial than people think, but I'm too timid to seem nasty.
- We started off trying to set up a small anarchist community, but people wouldn't obey the rules.
- Full-blooded romantic love I wouldn't be able to write about.
- I'm more socialist certainly than New Labour - I'm very old Labour, really.
- Teachers need to feel they are trusted. They must be allowed some leeway to use their imagination; otherwise, teaching loses all sense of wonder and excitement.

- I'm all in favour of free expression provided it's kept rigidly under control.
- Your whole life is on the other side of the glass. And there is nobody watching.
- If you think squash is a competitive activity, try flower arranging.
- I can't complain that I've had a public all through my writing life, but people don't quite know what I've written. People don't read you too closely. Perhaps, after I've died, they'll look at my stuff, and read it through, and find there's more in it. That may be wrong, but that's what I comfort myself with.
- I don't want to see libraries close; I want to find local solutions that will make them sustainable.
- I write plays about things that I can't resolve in my mind. I try to root things out.
- Those who have known the famous are publicly debriefed of their memories, knowing as their own dusk falls that they will only be remembered for remembering someone else.
- My films are about embarrassment.
- The bits I most remember about my school days are those that took place outside the classroom, as we were taken on countless theatre visits and trips to places of interest.
- Life is like a box of sardines and we are all looking for the key.
- I do not long for the world as it was when I was a child. I do not long for the person I was in that world. I do not want to be the person I am now in that world then. None of the forms nostalgia can take fits. I found childhood boring. I was glad it was over.

- Cancer, like any other illness, is a bore.
- Definition of a classic: a book everyone is assumed to have read and often thinks they have.
- Were we closer to the ground as children, or is the grass emptier now?
- I always like to break out and address the audience. In 'The History Boys', for instance, without any ado, the boys will suddenly turn and talk to the audience and then go back into the action. I find it more adventurous doing it in prose than on the stage, but I like being able to make the reader suddenly sit up.
- I'd somehow always thought of the classics of literature as something apart from me, something to do with academic life and not something you enjoyed.
- We were all miners in our family. My father was a miner. My mother is a miner. These are miner's hands, but we were all artists, I suppose, really. But I was the first one who had the urge to express myself on paper rather than at the coalface.
- Sometimes, particularly in summers in New York, I have tried to write in shorts or with no shirt on and found myself unable to do so, the reason being, I take it, that writing, even of the most impersonal sort, is for me a divestment, a striptease, even, so that if I start off undressed, I have nowhere to go.
- I have no nickname, as there has never been any need for one.
- I don't believe in private education.
- Closing a public library is child abuse, really, because it hinders child development.
- I've been very lucky in everything, really - in my career and in finding someone to share my life with, and in not dying.
- I didn't even have a clear idea of why I wanted to go to Oxford - apart from the fact I had fallen in love with the architecture. It certainly wasn't out of some great sense of academic or intellectual achievement. In many ways, my education only began after I'd left university.
- I've never seen the point of the sea, except where it meets the land. The shore has a point. The sea has none.
- Feeling I'd scarcely arrived at a style, I now find I'm near the end of it. I'm not quite sure what Late Style means except that it's some sort of licence, a permit for ageing practitioners to kick their heels up.
