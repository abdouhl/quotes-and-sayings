quotes = ['''Our government should speak a common language with the American people - plain English.''' ,'''If we don't re-charge the American Brand, all future challenges - economic, social and political - are destined to be driven to the brink, further jeopardizing the strength and competitiveness of our country and its citizens.''' ,'''I think the law should be comprehensible not only to those who work with it but also to those who are governed by it.''' ,'''Politicians must be simple and clear about how their ideas will serve the national cause. We can no longer use the complexity of today's problems as an excuse for inaction, rhyme or rhetoric that does not meet the challenges before us.''' ,'''What Republicans need to do is to go back to their roots - starting with Lincoln - and remind the nation that they are the party of national growth, racial equality and unity of purpose. These Lincolnian themes will serve Republicans - and the nation - much better than becoming the party on the lookout for the supposed rat head of higher taxes.''' ,'''Our national purpose, not our party differences, must define the American Brand. We must change the conversation from one centered around what defines our differences to one that hangs a lantern on what binds us, supports our collective well being and makes us all stronger and more productive as a result.''' ,'''I don't think any business has to give up legal protections in order to simplify. The main consideration is that whatever protection, rights and remedies a corporation wants, they should be put in terms that are understandable to the consumer.''' ,'''I love the interaction with different kinds of people. I like to shake things up, make a difference.''' ,'''I'm very interested in working with nonprofits, people in education, medicine, people who are doing things to improve the world and who don't have the money to come to Siegel+Gale for help.''' ,'''Too many politicians are shifting the critical themes of our national conversations from a 'big ideas' American Brand Platform to narrowly focused, polarizing sound bites that put party philosophy before what used to be heralded as the common good. These ideas, more often than not, divide us rather than serve to bind us.''' ,'''Representative government demands an ongoing conversation between legislators and constituents.''' ,]
