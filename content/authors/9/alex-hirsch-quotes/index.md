quotes = ['''Gravity Falls' didn't just appear overnight - every spooky cave and moss covered tree was created by a team of brilliant artists.''' ,'''Gravity Falls' is a very hard show to produce.''' ,'''Sometimes a sincere moment is the most surprising thing you can write.''' ,'''When you write scripts, it begins to feel like you're living in them.''' ,'''A lot of kid characters you see on TV are sassy, and snarky, and think they're just the coolest kids in the world, and are mean spirited.''' ,'''I spent many years of my childhood pondering the great mysteries like, 'Are aliens real?' and 'Why won't girls talk to me?'''' ,'''I remember when I was a kid, whenever you'd see cartoons cross over with each other, it always ranged from a delightful, magical surprise to a cynical, annoying cash grab.''' ,'''I always thought, if I was gonna make a kids show, I would want to make something that my own 12-year-old self would love. So, I put all that in a blender and stewed it together to create 'Gravity Falls.'''' ,'''With Twitter and Tumblr, it's easy to get lost in the tidal wave of feedback from fans.''' ,'''Everyone has days where they don't get their way, where you have to go to bed early or you have too much homework to do or you can't eat the candy that you want or you miss your favorite TV show and, in those moments, you just want to tear the whole world down.''' ,'''I love the idea that if you watch something twice, three times, four times, you'll continuously notice new things.''' ,'''When I was a kid, I was obsessed with UFOs in particular, and the paranormal.''' ,'''One of the interesting things about making a kids TV show is that you are in living rooms all across the world and you never know who's watching.''' ,'''When I was about 7 years old, I built a leprechaun trap out of a cardboard box, a biscuit tin and some toilet paper tubes.''' ,'''When I went to California Institute of the Arts, I was classmates with a lot of like-minded weirdoes, some of who have gone on to create other cartoon shows-J.G. Quintel, 'Regular Show;' Pen Ward, 'Adventure Time.' We were all friends in school and pushed each other and made each other laugh.''' ,'''A sibling is a friend for life, but they are a friend for life that you are forced to have. And like anything that you are forced to do, occasionally people will drive you crazy.''' ,'''A lot of the fun of 'Gravity Falls' comes from the secrecy surrounding the plot. We want fans to be able to guess and speculate, to be surprised by twists and be engaged when they get things right.''' ,'''I personally went canvassing door to door in a local race when I was in high school and thought it was kind of hilarious how worked up people got over such small stakes elections.''' ,'''Gravity Falls' is a show about mysteries and magic but first and foremost it's a show about characters.''' ,'''A weird show attracts weird fans!''' ,'''Gravity Falls' was a labor of love, but like all labor it could be painful at times.''' ,'''I think twins can sometimes be shoved into the same mold and they can start to feel like they're not being given a chance to develop their own identities.''' ,'''When I was 15 I did birdcalls on the David Letterman show, but I have since burned all video evidence of this.''' ,'''With the finale episode of 'Gravity Falls' our job as storytellers is to finish all the things we've started.''' ,'''The puberty train came late to the station for me. I was the shortest kid in my sixth-grade class - they made me pose for the yearbook with the tallest kid for comedic contrast.''' ,'''I watched the classics as a kid, and I could tell that Bugs Bunny in drag was a cartoon and a joke. It didn't make me start dressing in drag.''' ,'''It's always fun to write the little bit of TV that the characters watch in 'Gravity Falls,' because it's a perfect place to poke fun at the media.''' ,'''When me and my sister were growing up, we just had very different personalities. I was sort of analytical and took myself too seriously, and she was sort of goofy and nuts and full of love - too much love, she had a crush on a different guy every week.''' ,'''I loved 'The X-Files.'''' ,'''There are so many shows that go on endlessly until they lose their original spark, or mysteries that are cancelled before they ever get a chance to payoff.''' ,'''I was obsessed with the Loch Ness Monster, I would look through these books in the library and dream about visiting Loch Ness one day... That stuff was really kind of what I loved as a kid.''' ,'''I think the key as a creator is to just trust your own intuition, and follow your passion and trust that if you make something you love, an audience who loves it will find it.''' ,'''Gravity Falls' has so much inspiration that comes from 'Twin Peaks,' the idea of Agent Cooper being the one to drive Dipper and Mabel home made me feel like, yeah, they're going to be all right.''' ,'''I tended toward animated material that wasn't just for kids. I could tell as a kid watching those shows that I loved the jokes that I got but I also loved the jokes I didn't get because I felt that I was hanging out with a smarter, cooler audience.''' ,'''You don't have to sugar coat things for kids. If you make something for them with intelligence they will show that intelligence in ways that will sometimes shock you.''' ,'''Cute animals have a pretty good track record in animation for inspiring passionate fandom.''' ,'''I think there are a lot of shows out there that value being hip or cool over being funny and heartfelt.''' ,'''One day I'd love to release a coffee table book of all the crazy notes I got from Disney Channel's S&P and legal department.''' ,'''Yeah, my first love was 'The Simpsons,' but in terms of movies and stuff, I loved 'Back To The Future,' I loved 'Jurassic Park,' I loved 'The Truman Show.'''' ,'''When I was a kid, back in the days before cell phone cameras, I had disposable cameras I took a lot of pictures with and I just remember something always went wrong.''' ,'''I think the No. 1 lesson I learned from 'The Simpsons' was just that animation could be as funny as live-action. That animation could be funnier than live-action. That animation didn't have to just be for kids.''' ,'''I think good kids TV has got to have layers. It has to have compelling characters that everyone loves, but you can't dumb it down.''' ,'''I spent 90 percent of my childhood playing SNES and N64, and my favorite games were the ones packed with secrets.''' ,'''The more a character wants and the less a character has the ability to get what they want, the more you have an endless fuel for storytelling in comedy.''' ,'''Gravity Falls' is a riddle wrapped in an enigma tucked in a mystery deep-fried in a conundrum slathered in hickory-smoked puzzle sauce.''' ,'''To see where I've stolen all my ideas from, look no further than the comics at your local comic shop!''' ,'''I feel like the best kids shows aren't just for kids.''' ,'''The fact that childhood ends is exactly what makes it so precious - and why you should cherish it while it lasts.''' ,'''The Internet never ceases to impress me.''' ,'''As a kid, I was obsessed with 'Calvin and Hobbes' and 'Bone,' and I'm certain that I've unconsciously ripped off ideas from both, wholesale.''' ,'''I've never pitched a joke that I wouldn't be comfortable seeing in a Pixar film.''' ,'''If you ask anyone in animation, how long they've been into animation, they'll pretty much always tell you that it's since they can remember, and I'm no exception. I've always just loved drawing and loved cartoons.''' ,'''Not a lot of people get to say, 'I'm a cartoon character.'''' ,'''When I was 12 years old, I was obsessed with codes, conspiracies, and secret messages.''' ,'''I always designed 'Gravity Falls' to be a finite series about one epic summer-a series with a beginning, middle, and end.''' ,'''I remember spending one summer being utterly obsessed with trying to get the legendary unreachable 'Ice Key' from 'Banjo-Kazooie.'''' ,'''I will say this: 'Gravity Falls' is a show about mystery, that itch you get when you're curious. That itself is a really cool, inspiring thing.''' ,'''While everyone was out playing dodgeball, I was lying on the blacktop waiting for a UFO to take me out of elementary school.''' ,'''We passed a sign for Boring, Oregon. We never went there, but I was positively enchanted with the idea that there was a town called Boring. 'Gravity Falls' is partially from what I imagine Boring might be like. Or maybe the opposite of Boring, Oregon, would be 'Gravity Falls.'''' ,'''One thing that's a lot harder to put into stories than you'd think is the idea of a traditional monster, because monsters with a capital 'M' don't inherently lend themselves to a story about your character. Unless one of your characters is themselves the monster, simply having a monster leads to a chase or a hunt.''' ,'''One of the nice things about not working on a TV show anymore is that I'm not on any particular kind of clock.''' ,'''I remember as a kid being scared of the things that go bump in the night, but I was way more scared of adults.''' ,'''Endings are scary and foreign. They split you up emotionally and put you in a place where you don't know what's going to happen next. But with every end of the world, there is a new world that follows.''' ,'''I was raised in the '90s. I love 'Seinfeld.'''' ,'''My sister, when we were in Elementary school, had one particular lime green fuzzy troll doll sweater with a gem sticking out of the belly and actual hair that stuck to it, and I just remember, even though I was very young, being like 'This is unusual. It is weird that she is wearing this in public.'''' ,'''I never doubted that if I applied myself and tried to learn that I would good at it. I've had a lot of lucky turns, no doubt. But it's actually been a fairly direct line from control-freak, cartoon-obsessed kindergartner to control-freak, cartoon-obsessed executive producer.''' ,'''I went to art school for four years to learn a very expensive lesson - that there are many other artists who are way better than me.''' ,'''Gravity Falls' normally follows very particular rules: we start out in reality close to the world as we know it, usually one magical element presents itself, and then it's essentially vanished or hidden back to where it came from by the end of the 20 minutes.''' ,'''I loved 'The Simpsons' because it didn't talk down to its audience.''' ,'''With shows like 'The X-Files' or 'Eerie, Indiana' - even though they would have comedic moments, even though they would have character moments - there was a sincerity about magic.''' ,'''The best way to make a show that's going to resonate is to make a show that you'd love.''' ,'''It's weird because we live in this age of reboots. Everything is getting rebooted: 'The X-Files,' 'Twin Peaks.' We have shows like 'Gravity Falls' that were inspired by these shows, that are now ending and being followed up by reboots of the shows that inspired them.''' ,'''I can speak to my experience and say that CalArts worked out very well for me. After CalArts, I went to Cartoon Network, and then came to Disney.''' ,'''Animation's a small industry, and no matter where you go you're going to meet your friends from CalArts.''' ,'''Cliffhangers are a lot of fun, but I think they can be easily abused if you're not careful.''' ,'''My mom is always right.''' ,'''When you're drawing from observation and experience, whether you intend to or not, you'll create a more relatable cartoon.''' ,'''As long as I can recall I've always wanted to make cartoons.''' ,]
