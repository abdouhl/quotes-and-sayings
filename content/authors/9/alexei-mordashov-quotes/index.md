- My wealth is reflected in the price of Severstal, and the number of shares I have in my possession doesn't have any impact on the company.
- Regarding our links with the Russian government, Severstal is a private company with no government participation. We are answerable to our shareholders.
- People were expecting Rouge to go bankrupt, so there was a lot of anxiety. The corporate culture problem was even worse than in Russia. And at the same time, the work rules were more difficult.
- Russia is not a homogenous country; it's a very fragmented country.
- It is a very big exaggeration to say I am a friend of Mr. Putin.
- In a literal sense, even a private company, of course, cannot do everything that it wants without some discussion with government. As a good corporate citizen, Severstal discussed the idea of a merger with Arcelor with the Russian government.
- Well... I graduated from the business school of Northumberland University in Newcastle.
- We believe that the business system only is the key to success. It's no miracle, only day-to-day work in the appropriate way.
- Building companies involves creating great wealth. If that means I am an oligarch, OK, it's fine. But if being an oligarch is about buying football clubs, it is not for me.
- I don't have any opinions about Russians. There are celebrity persons in each country. Different people do different things.
- When we put $4 billion into the U.S. economy, they were OK with this. When we preserved jobs in Dearborn, or preserved jobs in Columbus, or preserved jobs in Pennsylvania, everyone was happy.
- What you need to keep most in the U.S. is the entrepreneurial spirit.
- The U.S. has done a great job improving productivity. We're making a lot more steel in Dearborn with fewer people. The unions have accepted much better work rules.
- The future is in green energy; it's in making steel for energy-efficient cars.
- We appreciate size, but only if it is robust growth. Just to be big is not a target.
- The steel business is a local business. We do believe in the U.S. economy and would like to have a strong, balanced presence here.
