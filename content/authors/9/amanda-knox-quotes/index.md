- There are those who believe in my innocence and those who believe in my guilt. There is no in-between.

- I have a few close friends with whom I can practice speaking Italian, but I mostly maintain fluency through reading.
- The only thing I rely on is caffeine.

- I know I may appear spacey, but that's how I am.
- I have been in an experience where I thought everything that I had hoped for in my life was taken away from me, and I had to redefine what mattered.
- That is the thing that I was scared of - that I would know intellectually that there's something to glean out of life, but that I would be so broken that I wouldn't care.

- If I'm guilty, I'm the ultimate figure to fear, because I'm not the obvious one. But, on the other hand, if I'm innocent, it means that everyone is vulnerable, and that is everyone's nightmare. Either I'm a psychopath in sheep's clothing, or I am you.
- I was told that my best-case scenario would likely consist of writing my memoir and then disappearing.
- Now I have normal-person fears - fears of failure, of not being smart enough or strong enough or kind enough.
- I didn't confess. I was interrogated. They acted like my answers were wrong. They told me I was wrong, that I didn't remember correctly, that I had to remember correctly. And if I didn't, I would never see my family.

- It's almost like living a double life where I'm in a limbo space where Amanda Knox, a real person, exists, 'Foxy Knoxy,' an idea of a person, exists, and I'm constantly having to juggle how someone is interacting with me based upon that two-dimensional person of me that has been in the public's imagination for so long.
- What I started to read and most enjoyed while I was a student was an Italian edition of 'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.'

- I know that Perugia is probably the least-welcome place for me in the entire world.
- In a time when my entire family had already tapped into their retirement savings and taken out second mortgages, we were grateful when any supporters, including Trump, donated to my defense and spoke out about my innocence.
- I was not aware of a ton of the stuff that was being said about me out in the world since I wasn't able to get British or American headlines from my prison cell in Perugia. But I was aware that in the courtroom, I was being called a succubus, a man-eater, 'Foxy Knoxy.'
