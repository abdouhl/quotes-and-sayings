- I fully trust Abbas-Mustan. We have worked together in the past, so I have full faith in them.
- Had I not made it big, my family would have told me to recheck my decision. Now that I am successful, there is no way. They have to accept it gracefully.
- I had auditioned for 'Lagaan.' That's where I met Aamir for the first time. He was a superstar; I was a nobody. Yet, he treated me gently and affectionately. He put me at ease completely.
- I would never deny the importance of the media, but I wouldn't go out of the way to splash my pictures all over town. I'd rather let my work do the talking.
- We're not getting married right now. We're very, very focused on our respective careers. Marriage is a long way away. Yes, I'm very close to Vikram Bhatt.
- I was in Hyderabad shooting for a Telugu film with Mahesh Babu when Aamir called, saying he wanted me to play the widow Jwala in 'Mangal Pandey.'
- I'm not ashamed of any work I do. You can't decide a film's fate before its release. There's no surety that your new films will be better or worse than your previous ones. You can only hope to surpass your efforts.
- Believe me, it's not easy being an actress and a producer, especially with no big daddy to support you.
- I grew up idolising Madhuri Dixit, though I wasn't a Hindi film buff. I had an academic upbringing, and movies were a rarity. I looked up to Madhuri because I loved dancing, and she's a fantastic dancer.
- I reprimand people, even those working with me, for littering the roads.
- Cleaning is therapy for me. I'm not ashamed of holding the duster or broom.
- Life is all about evolution. What looks like a mistake to others has been a milestone in my life. Even if people have betrayed me, even if my heart was broken, even if people misunderstood or judged me, I have learned from these incidents. We are human and we make mistakes, but learning from them is what makes the difference.
- I love human beings. I believe that there is so much to learn from every person you meet, including a child.
- I work on my body to stay fit, but that does not make me superior to anyone. I am a forthright and hardworking girl.
- We have a wonderful film lined up early next year called 'Desi Magic.' It showcases me in a double role for the first time. This movie has offered me the most challenging role of my career so far. It's weird I chose to do my toughest film with my own production house.
- Everyone knows Aamir to be a perfectionist. But only those who have worked with him can vouch for his integrity. I had the privilege of doing one of my most important films, 'Mangal Pandey: The Rising' with Aamir.
- To join or not to join films was the biggest choice I had to make. I'd done two years of biogenetic engineering, was an economics graduate and a gold medalist. I had also been a Bharatanatyam dancer from age five, always won the best actress award in school. Finally, I decided to do things for my soul, chose to act.
- It feels phenomenal. It's a great feeling. 'Race 2' is a big film to be associated with.
- Being sexy is all about attitude, not body type. It's a state of mind.
- I used to call him Pinocchio on the sets. Pinocchio's nose would turn red if he lied. Aamir would turn red-faced if he had to tell a lie.
- I had to take a break to set up my production company. Managing a production house is a different ballgame. It's not like signing a film and arriving on the set.
- Work is my balm. I've just finished my work in Ketan Mehta's 'The Rising.' It's one of the best films I've done. Such a fabulous line-up of technicians and artistes. Above all, I got the privilege of working with Aamir Khan.
- I feel French is very close to Urdu. Both languages are beautiful. Sadly, their beauty is lost in translation.
- I would want a sequel to 'Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai.' But more than me, it's the audience who are looking forward to the same.
- The kind of love that people have for Hrithik and me, if there were a 'Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai 2,' the film will get a bumper opening only, for sure.
