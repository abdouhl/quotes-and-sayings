- You could argue that if the average golfer plays a golf course with 430-yard par 4s and they always miss the green, that's good practice. It's definitely great practice to play a course that's too long for you.
- Don't give advice unless you're asked.
- Concentrate, play your game, and don't be afraid to win.
- What makes a great golf course is continuity and variety: right-to-left holes, left-to-right holes.
- Golf is a spiritual game. It's like Zen. You have to let your mind take over.
- My parents didn't play golf.
- I don't think the philosophy really changes between men and women. I think golf courses need to become more distance-friendly overall. I think golf courses almost need to develop a more generic set of tees instead of calling them black, blue, red or whatever.
- The pressure of getting an order right is greater than sinking a putt.
- Golf isn't just about hitting a lot of drivers. I grew up playing on my front lawn, chipping and putting into soup cans, out of the ivy and over rose bushes and hedges - the little Alcott Golf and Country Club. I just loved having a wedge in my hands.
