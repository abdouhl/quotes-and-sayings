quotes = ['''I have been very clear for years - leaving the E.U. means leaving the single market, leaving the customs union, taking back control of our money, border, and laws.''' ,'''I am a very committed Christian. I think my values and everything I do is driven by that.''' ,'''If you're left to scream and scream day after day, your levels of cortisol remain high, and you develop a slight immunity to your own stress, so what you find is babies who have been neglected tend to become risk-takers.''' ,'''I have a passion for support for new families, which Boris Johnson shares.''' ,'''I am a big fan of seeing more women in public life.''' ,'''We can restore that vital trust between politics and the people.''' ,'''The reason I say 'never say never' is because I do not think that there should be another independence referendum in Scotland - I do not think it's in their interest - but on the other hand, I am a big believer in devolution.''' ,'''By cutting the red tape that comes out of Brussels, we will free our farmers to grow more, sell more, and export more great British food whilst upholding our high standards for plant and animal health and welfare.''' ,'''What I think we have to be doing is promote the strength of the U.K. working together far stronger, far more than we have done, and I have a number of policy areas that I would use to try and make that happen.''' ,'''My real passion is social justice, resolving the lack of empowerment, the lack of skills, the fact that young people can't get on the housing ladder, they feel they can't have a decent job, they feel they aren't in control of their lives.''' ,'''Parliament's centuries of history have been overwhelmingly dominated by men, but things are changing.''' ,'''My kids are a huge part of my life.''' ,'''This is, after all, the country that gave the world the rule of law, parliamentary democracy, the right to own property, the English language, and the free market... we are a remarkable people, and we have so much more to give.''' ,'''If the government has any courage, it will punish those at the top of failed banks. Accountability is critical in every area of human endeavour - there has to be a penalty for failure; otherwise, it's only a matter of time before the economic pain our banks have caused to so many innocent businesses and homeowners is forgotten.''' ,'''I wholeheartedly believe that same-sex couples have as valid a relationship with their partner as do heterosexuals. I also believe that in the eyes of the state, we all deserve to be treated equally.''' ,'''I know what we need to get done to leave the E.U. in a smooth fashion - and I also know that we do not need is a lengthy extension.''' ,'''The E.U. without Britain is like fish without chips.''' ,'''Genuinely, as a mum, all the sunlit uplands are when we leave the European Union.''' ,'''The government takes the opposition day debates incredibly seriously.''' ,'''Over the centuries, the country has looked on as Parliament has faced historic decisions. Even in the most challenging of times, we have pulled together and put our duty above all else.''' ,'''I want to be crystal clear that everyone has an equal stake in our society and in the future of our country. That is what I believe, and it is what I have always believed.''' ,'''Ed Timpson is a fantastic minister for early intervention, and Liz Truss is a fantastic minister for Sure Start.''' ,'''Like so many other people in the U.K., I took the chance offered to us in a single question: Should we leave the European Union or remain within it? Following a great deal of thought and thorough analysis, the answer I arrived at was, 'Yes, we should leave the E.U.'''' ,'''The E.U. referendum didn't cause divisions, but it certainly did reveal them. Many people are shocked at the result, but they really shouldn't be. What I would like to say to them is, please, don't be afraid.''' ,'''Marriage in the biblical sense is very clearly - from the many, many Christians who wrote to me on this subject, in their opinion - can only be between a man and a woman.''' ,'''Economic success is the vital underpinning of every happy nation.''' ,'''For many parents - myself included - I would be extremely happy for my children to grow up finding that their LGBT classmates are exactly the same as them.''' ,'''When women speak out and say there is a problem, the answer is not, 'No there isn't.'''' ,'''Being a mum means you have a very real stake in the future of our country.''' ,'''As leader of the House, I seek to do exactly that, treating all members of Parliament with courtesy and respect.''' ,'''Transparency will be at the heart of everything I do - it's what parliament expects, and it's what the public deserves.''' ,'''What I'm suggesting is making an offer to the E.U. for things that were already agreed in the withdrawal agreement that will enable us to leave with a managed exit.''' ,'''I envisage there being absolutely no regulation whatsoever - no minimum wage, no maternity or paternity rights, no unfair dismissal rights, no pension rights - for the smallest companies that are trying to get off the ground, in order to give them a chance.''' ,'''I want to live in a Britain whose residents are determined to speak English.''' ,'''It would be helpful if broadcasters were willing to be a bit patriotic.''' ,'''Decarbonising our energy system is not some abstract regulatory requirement. It is an essential responsibility that we hold towards our children and grandchildren as the only way to effectively counter the threat of climate change.''' ,'''We can demonstrate to the world that the U.K. remains a beacon for opportunity, fairness, and democratic leadership.''' ,'''If I was prime minister, there would be absolutely zero risk that Brexit wouldn't happen.''' ,'''When in doubt, cook a Sunday roast, get the family around you, and you'll feel fine afterwards.''' ,'''However we choose to leave the E.U., let me be clear: we remain committed to dealing with climate change.''' ,'''There are so many double standards that seem to be applied only to female MPs. I've had infinite comments about what I'm wearing when the focus should be on what I'm saying.''' ,'''At the end of the day, European politicians face the ballot box, as do all of us politicians.''' ,'''I believe that the love of same-sex couples is every bit as valuable as that of opposite-sex couple.''' ,'''A century after some women first got the vote, we are upping the pressure for change to consign Parliament's legacy of inequality in the past.''' ,'''Twenty-seven member states cannot even organise a takeaway curry, let alone what they are going to do on free trade deals with the rest of the world.''' ,'''Theresa May... is ideally placed to implement Brexit on the best possible terms for the British people, and she has promised she will do so.''' ,'''I just don't accept the premise that we have any economic issue with voting to leave. I think it's absolutely balanced.''' ,'''The government believes that we will need to take the step of enshrining the Paris goal for net zero emissions in U.K. law. The question is not whether but how we do it.''' ,'''What gets you out of bed in the morning? This is a question I'm often asked as a politician. It tends to be closely followed by a dozen other questions about what I'll do in 'x' scenario or whether I'll resign if 'y' happens.''' ,'''I want to live in Britain with a sense of humour - where there are no groups whose life choices are 'above' criticism.''' ,'''My CV, as I've presented it, is exactly accurate.''' ,'''I think it is right that government should have passed legislation that requires that relationships and sex education is taught in schools, but at the same time, I also agree that it is right that parents should be able to choose the moment at which their children become exposed to that information.''' ,'''Like so many of my generation and those younger, I have spent most of my life in the E.U., and my instincts were naturally for reform from within.''' ,'''Neither we nor our European friends need prolonged uncertainty, and not everything needs to be negotiated before Article 50 is triggered and the exit process is concluded.''' ,'''Too few people in my old field of financial services were ever brought to book for their part in the 2008 crash.''' ,'''I have deep sympathy with the hundreds of my constituents who fear that legislation for same-sex marriage will profoundly encroach - although this may be unintended - on their right to live according to their faith.''' ,'''Women have a huge amount to offer. We're not all one homogenous bunch. We've all got different strengths and weaknesses.''' ,'''No one needs to fear our decision to leave the E.U. We will do so carefully, reassuring our European friends and those businesses who are worrying about change.''' ,'''I would like to pilot a government-led scheme, alongside Help to Buy, to offer a loan to young people on a reasonable income to be able to pay the deposit on a new home and then swap their high rents for a mortgage and actually have a place of their own.''' ,'''As an employer, we're not - let's face it: most of us don't employ men as nannies. Most of us don't. Now you can call that sexist; I call that cautious and very sensible when you look at the stats. Your odds are stacked against you if you employ a man.''' ,'''The wellbeing we all crave goes hand in hand with economic success.''' ,'''I've set up businesses. I've set up charities. I have actually done the work myself.''' ,'''We had the biggest democratic exercise, and the majority voted to leave the E.U. It is our duty to make sure we do that.''' ,'''I think people will always do have an interest in policy areas, but Brexit is certainly got people talking and thinking and, so, probably more engaged than they would otherwise be.''' ,'''With every ounce of my heart, my brain, and my experience, I absolutely believe that the bright future for all of our children and grandchildren is when we vote Leave.''' ,'''Individual bankers are rightly being investigated by the police. I and all colleagues in the chamber hope that if criminality is proven, they will go to jail and bear the same brunt of punishment as any other criminal.''' ,'''Along with 'normal' people in this country, I'm sick and tired of political correctness.''' ,'''I don't work with UKIP. They don't advise me.''' ,'''What I think we should be doing is refocusing all the prevention budgets, all the money spent on teen gangs and young offenders, on conception to age two at a rate of 2% a year.''' ,'''I urge the Government to look carefully at scrapping the entire burden of regulation on micro-businesses with, say, three employees or fewer.''' ,'''My first task is to show how great we are as a nation - let's banish the pessimists.''' ,'''The period from conception to two is about the development of a baby's emotional capacities. Mum saying, 'Oh, darling, I love you,' and singing baby songs and pulling faces literally stimulates the synapses in the brain.''' ,'''I want to live in a Britain where there is a shared belief in freedom and democracy, and equal rights for men and women.''' ,'''Banks were already seen as greedy and arrogant. They have now reached the depths of humiliation in the wake of the LIBOR manipulation, PPI mis-selling, and bank swaps mis-selling.''' ,'''Certainty in politics is never a given.''' ,'''Hunting is alive and well, and so it should be.''' ,'''I don't think the U.K. should leave the E.U. I think it would be a disaster for our economy, and it would lead to a decade of economic and political uncertainty at a time when the tectonic plates of global success are moving.''' ,'''Prosperity should be our goal, not austerity.''' ,'''We must give young people and others who cannot find a job a direct and clear incentive to create one for themselves by starting a business.''' ,'''I'm passionate about parliament democracy.''' ,'''The U.K.'s climate change act was passed by a majority of 463 votes to three. That is really quite extraordinary. The will of parliament has rarely been expressed so strongly and unambiguously.''' ,'''I see myself as, one, an optimist, and two, a member of a huge family, and that's important to me.''' ,'''The reality of government is we are all very busy day-to-day, and often, the discussions about very deeply held views on things - there isn't the time and space to do that.''' ,'''My Twitter feed is polluted with vitriolic personal abuse, much of it gendered. Like almost all female Members of Parliament, I have both seen and experienced inappropriate and sexist behaviour.''' ,'''I'd never write off a whole sex.''' ,'''I will do everything in my power to keep the United Kingdom united.''' ,'''I truly believe in the bright future that awaits us once we leave the E.U.''' ,'''One of my own kids was in a class with a friend who had two mums, and that was absolutely normal right from a very young age. I think it's important that we absolutely accept equality in every area whilst at the same time respecting that parents may have concerns about how young their children are when they become aware of these things.''' ,'''I am a passionate, pragmatic, and positive believer in Brexit, and with my three-step plan, we can decisively leave the E.U.''' ,'''At the end of the day, family will always come first.''' ,'''It's an uncomfortable fact that leaving the European Union in a way that is true to the referendum result is becoming harder and harder to deliver.''' ,'''I truly believe we can be the greatest nation on Earth.''' ,'''The U.K. will leave the European Union, freedom of movement will end, and the British parliament will decide how many people come to live here.''' ,'''We in the so called 'Western civilisations' have so much to learn from other cultures, and they would stand to gain so much by learning from ours. We don't have all the answers - far from it... but nor do any other culture or religion.''' ,'''I take my responsibilities to this House very seriously.''' ,'''Having children has no bearing on the ability to be PM. I deeply regret that anyone has got the impression that I think otherwise.''' ,'''I believed in a number of the E.U.'s core values - the promotion of peace, global trading opportunities, and the values of freedom and democracy. These are areas in which our great country leads the world.''' ,'''I absolutely am a Christian, and I am very proud of it.''' ,'''My husband knows who I am. My friends, my family - they know I would never lie.''' ,'''I think, as ever, with a big change like Brexit, it's awakened people's interest in politics.''' ,]
