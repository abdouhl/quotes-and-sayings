quotes = ['''The motorway network helps bind Britain together. It remains an extraordinary achievement, making a huge contribution to our economy and our way of life.''' ,'''Efficiency, connectivity and productivity are all economic buzzwords that people have said high-speed rail will deliver. But at the heart of it what high-speed rail will deliver is growth and jobs.''' ,'''Systematic social and environmental deregulation, and the economics of austerity while enriching the rich, will be the markers of Farage/Tory politics after Brexit. Singapore-on-Sea for the rich; degradation for the rest.''' ,'''In the end, pragmatism requires a workable compromise. But none exists on Brexit.''' ,'''The strength of the British constitution is supposedly its ability, because it is unwritten in key respects like the incapacity of the prime minister, to adapt to crises with flexibility and urgency.''' ,'''Education for all up to 18, and lifelong learning beyond. That is a vision true to Ruskin - the man, the college, and the speech.''' ,'''You should be completely honest and open in public about who you are.''' ,'''England's dominant schools, universities, professions and enterprises are largely in the ideological and filial grip of the Conservative party. This isn't always obvious but it is emphatic, especially when they are threatened.''' ,'''Global warming - utterly disinterested in our political paralysis - worsens at a terrifying pace.''' ,'''By managing the speed of traffic and opening the hard shoulder as a new running lane in times of congestion, the M42 pilot showed that it is possible to smooth traffic flow and improve journey reliability safely on a seriously congested route. And it has proved popular with drivers whose motoring experience has improved.''' ,'''The BBC is consistently manipulated by Brexiteers into providing them with false parity in arguments where their views add nothing, represent nobody and are demonstrably and factually wrong.''' ,'''I joined the SDP as a founder member a few days after my 18th birthday in 1981. I was a councillor, activist and parliamentary candidate for the SDP and its successor party, the Liberal Democrats, for 14 years before joining Labour when Tony Blair became leader and abolished Labour's old clause IV - committing to general nationalisation - in 1995.''' ,'''Unprincipled governments are inevitably unstable, unsuccessful and short-lived.''' ,'''For me, no one aspect of the Brexit debate displays so markedly the monomania of many Brexiteers as does the Irish question.''' ,'''It is important to understand that the WTO, like the United Nations, is a weak international agency which depends upon financing and support from its largest members.''' ,'''I have three children. A son, a daughter, and HS2.''' ,'''From the ruins of the second world war, Labour rebuilt Britain and set it on course for European co-operation and membership of the E.U.''' ,'''In Germany, apprentices undergo a final examination in the vocational school and an oral examination and practical test in the workplace. The same should happen in Britain.''' ,'''Not one single country in the world is dependent for their trade wholly on WTO guidelines - they aren't 'rules,' because the sanctions for breaching the guidelines are puny.''' ,'''My father came to Britain in search of a better life. My aunts, uncles and cousins fled here in search of safety as Cyprus's Greek and Turkish populations fell into open hostility.''' ,'''Theresa May has much to answer for, but it is not her fault that she couldn't square the circle of the Brexiteers' lies: nobody could.''' ,'''The reason why I'm so passionate about turning around failing schools is that children who have the misfortune to go to unsucccessful institutions are far less likely to come across the individuals who can transform their lives.''' ,'''By neglecting education, the 1974 Labour government failed as surely as on the picket lines of Grunwick.''' ,'''The Conservatives have been unusually badly led by David Cameron and Theresa May.''' ,'''The SDP's founder, Roy Jenkins, was my hero and later mentor.''' ,'''When a small number of companies control both the generation and the supply of energy, it's difficult for new players to enter the market.''' ,'''Teachers need to have the capacity to spot those that are struggling early on and intervene.''' ,'''England is so dominant within the U.K. that separate English and U.K. parliaments and governments are a recipe for weakness and instability.''' ,'''I am an electoral reformer and an ex-Lib Dem.''' ,'''The individuals who intervened in my life, transformed it, didn't do so in a vacuum. One was a manager of a children's home, a whole string of them were teachers. What they had in common was that they worked in successful institutions.''' ,'''What we need is fundamental reform to address the deep social and economic problems that are gripping people and communities nationwide, particularly the least advantaged.''' ,'''The partial exception to our London-centric state institutions is the monarchy, which has always had peripatetic tendencies.''' ,'''Britain's railways don't need to be wholly nationalised and they don't need to be operated solely by private companies. Both of these myopias harm our ability to get the best deal for passengers.''' ,'''I want a European future where we extend and reinforce peace and prosperity to the east, a future where workers are better protected and inequalities reduced, where our energy and lifestyles are clean and green, where democracy is enhanced, where taxes are paid and corporations play by fair rules.''' ,'''There are issues that shape every generation and define every age. Climate change is just such an issue and our political generation has got to deal with it.''' ,'''As a Londoner who delights in the capital's dynamism and diversity, I none the less agree with Ken Livingstone that London hosts too great a share of our national institutions. Where sensible, more should be located in other cities, particularly new or reformed institutions that involve new facilities.''' ,'''No matter the evidence or the experience, the Conservative party has been allergic to direct state involvement in running our railways.''' ,'''The people should make the final decision on Brexit when they see the government's Brexit deal.''' ,'''What most teachers need is very strong leadership and motivation, and when it comes to recruiting teachers you want to have the biggest possible pool possible.''' ,'''Yes, I have found many people who voted for Brexit and believe it will answer their problems. But they mostly realise that Europe isn't the problem, however much the E.U. could be improved.''' ,'''I'm clear that new schools should only go in areas where there is a need for places. I'm equally clear that we need those schools to have the governance and the leadership to succeed.''' ,'''Resistance to Brexit is the logic of everything Labour stands for.''' ,'''Night buses serve not only the leisure economy- pubs, bars, clubs, theatres and concerts- but also hundreds of thousands of night workers.''' ,'''Brexit is not, thankfully, a question of war. But, like Iraq, Brexit is an act of unprovoked self-harm and a massive strategic mistake that threatens Britain's credibility and authority in the world.''' ,'''Apprenticeships must be more than a re-branding of in-work training if they are going to have a substantive impact on the future economy and the life chances of our young people.''' ,'''I think universities are one of the great civilising forces of life.''' ,'''Brexit has always been an impossible project, except at the price of massive self-harm.''' ,'''Despite my deep misgivings about austerity and the harm it would do, I agreed to chair the national infrastructure commission under a Tory government, because I believed that delivering infrastructure investment could help build a brighter future for businesses and families. I am a pragmatist. I do what works.''' ,'''Opening up closed markets to competition and protecting consumers from monopoly-style profits is the essence of pro-business politics on the modernising right as much as the left.''' ,'''Good government has essentially broken down in the face of Brexit.''' ,'''All partners in the workplaces have a key role to play in training a workforce fit for the future.''' ,'''On the left, nationalisation is pursued for its own sake - as a panacea that will somehow fix train travel all by itself.''' ,'''The original sin of Brexit - the lies, contradictions, half-truths and omissions on which it was built - have come back to haunt the Thatcherite Tories who started all this with Nigel Farage and Ukip.''' ,'''Universities should be supporting Teach First, actively promoting it among their students and financially supporting them to join the scheme, using a small fraction of their income from higher fees for this purpose.''' ,'''Nothing is clear cut in the debate surrounding high-speed rail, but from its successes elsewhere we can be confident that it pays a great dividend to the society it serves.''' ,'''Having achieved something so special as peace, it is criminal to throw it away on a whim.''' ,'''Clement Attlee, the man who led us out of the rubble of the Second World War and into a more modern, egalitarian Britain, is one of this country's greatest Prime Ministers. One major reason for this is that he was better able to recognise the wants and needs of the British people than some of his more polished political contemporaries.''' ,'''Brexit is a cliff, not a gradient. The mistake we are in danger of making is to believe that some Brexits are better than others when the fundamental problem is Brexit itself.''' ,'''Our European neighbours in France have invested in their infrastructure early and are now reaping the rewards later. This is because wherever high-speed rail has been built between the major cities and economic centres of a country - as in HS2 - it has exceeded demand forecasts.''' ,'''School standards need to rise a lot further if the full potential of all our young people, particularly those from poorer backgrounds, is to be realised: there is no room for complacency.''' ,'''I thought I'd left politics when Labour lost the 2010 election and I went off and ran a thinktank for two years and founded the National Infrastructure Commission. It was only because of Brexit that I came back. And I had to learn rapidly how to do politics in the 2010s and it soon became clear to me that you had to be ever-present on social media.''' ,'''Speaking to people in all parts of the country, it has become clear to me that there is a definite appetite for the option to reject Theresa May's Brexit and hold a referendum.''' ,'''Nobody knows the tragedy of a small island divided against itself better than a Cypriot.''' ,'''In the hundreds of hours spent in Parliament debating Brexit, I constantly think of how we could have spent our time better.''' ,'''It is clear to me that when London has expanded successfully in the past, there has always been a plan.''' ,'''I've always believed in one nation even when it wasn't entirely fashionable inside the Labour party... and I believe one nation means building a really solid alliance between the classes.''' ,'''Developing survival skills in life is incredibly important and I was very lucky that I developed them at a very young age.''' ,'''Labour is the party of the NHS and the environment and fighting for better workplace and civic rights for working men and women.''' ,'''What is clear to me is that social media is a skill and you have to keep working at it. But it hasn't taken over my life. I think I use it, it doesn't use me.''' ,'''Labour should have fought with every sinew in 2010 to retain power. To give up power voluntarily because you are tired of government and it is all too difficult is a betrayal of the people you serve.''' ,'''We shouldn't leave the E.U. until we have trade protection at least as good.''' ,'''Tests account for only a couple of hours within the six years of a child's primary education, but parents expect to know how their children are doing and the government has a responsibility to monitor and control standards.''' ,'''It is a vital British and European interest to demonstrate to Putin that Trump is on our side, not his.''' ,'''Until the late 1950s Britain's leaders were slow to appreciate the social and economic value of motorways. The first stretch of German Autobahn had opened before the first world war, as did the first highway in the U.S. Other countries followed suit in the inter-war years.''' ,'''In the hands of great school leaders, Teach First can make a spectacular difference.''' ,'''I'm never drunk. I do drink but never more than a glass or two of wine a day if that.''' ,'''For the Conservative Party to become the mouthpiece of energy monopolists is not only a political error; it is fundamentally at variance with the liberal economics they claim to espouse.''' ,'''London's night economy is huge and it couldn't function without London's night buses.''' ,'''Academies place a high premium on local community engagement.''' ,'''Multinational companies exploit national differences to abuse their workers, to dodge their taxes and to 'regulation shop' as a means to avoid meeting their responsibilities.''' ,'''International examples prove that high-speed rail pays for itself.''' ,'''Lots of my contemporaries have had to come to terms with who they are and realise all those deeply held assumptions we had when we were teenagers and in our 20s no longer apply.''' ,'''In politics, exhaustion and attrition need to be overcome, not indulged.''' ,'''I don't answer deeply hypothetical questions.''' ,'''Brexit is not a viable path for Britain.''' ,'''Theresa May is singularly unsuited for high office and lacks political talent.''' ,'''I was warned by the private sector that we would fail and would fail badly. 'The state can't run a railway,' I was told. Well, they were wrong.''' ,'''Bruce Liddington, who has died aged 70, was the most exotic creature in the Department for Education in the 2000s. In a land of fairly staid civil servants, Bruce had flair and the panache of a brilliant parakeet.''' ,'''Austerity and Brexit are two sides of the same coin, like the Brexit party and the Tories.''' ,'''The only way Brexit might have worked without an economic collapse is the Norway model of close integration with the structure of the European customs union and single market without being part of the formal E.U. institutions.''' ,'''When I was a minister I only went on about things I was going to make happen. I very rarely talked about things I wasn't.''' ,'''It is simply not possible to achieve the 'freedom' from E.U. economic institutions that Brexiters want without undermining Britain's economy and security.''' ,'''I'm prepared to argue with some of my Labour colleagues about doing what it takes to see that every school has the governance needed to succeed.''' ,'''Teach First is uniquely placed to help universities broaden the social background of their student intake.''' ,'''Parents who've not had an education themselves find it hard to explain to their children what a decent education involves, and I completely understand that. Parents themselves need to be educated by schools about what sort of education they should expect for their children. I do think there's a heavy responsibility of the school.''' ,'''Virtually no other state concentrates as much political, economic and cultural power in its capital city. Even Paris is less economically dominant than London and its hinterland.''' ,'''I have to confess, street politics are not my usual style.''' ,'''For decades, British governments - including the Blair-Brown government in which I was an education minister - have done a good job of enhancing higher education but paid too little attention to apprenticeships and technical education.''' ,'''I have been called many things in public life, but the cap that best fits is that of the centrist dad.''' ,'''We have moral duties to the dispossessed - and should be taking our fair share of Syrian refugees, particularly parentless children.''' ,]
