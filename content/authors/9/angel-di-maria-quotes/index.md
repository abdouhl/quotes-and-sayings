A free kick can unlock a game.''' ,'''It's special - when you start playing, you are aware of names like Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie; you have seen them playing and know what great players they are. So it's fantastic to have a chance to line up with them. I'm really pleased with how that understanding has started off.''' ,'''Losing one final, that happens, but when it happens three times in a row, that is something else entirely.''' ,'''Thanks to God, I was able to come to PSG and be myself again.''' ,'''PSG's ambition of the Champions League is also mine.

You can never predict where you're going to play.''' ,'''It was always a dream and goal of mine to try out in English football.''' ,'''When I am an old man, I will tell my grandchildren bedtime stories about when I won the Champions League, hopefully when I won the World Cup, but most of all, I will tell them that their grandfather used to play with Lionel Messi.''' ,'''Everybody had heard the rumours that Real wanted to sign James Rodriguez after the World Cup, and I knew that they were going to sell me to make room for him.''' ,'''Winning the Champions League was the best thing that has happened to me at a club, the best thing that happened to me in my life.''' ,'''I really wanted to play in the Premier League, which I'd been watching since I was a youngster every Saturday or Sunday before I'd go and play for Rosario Central.''' ,'''Blanc called me when he was in the United States and I was still on holiday. He said he was very happy to recruit me, that he had wanted me for several seasons. Obviously, this gave me an added incentive to sign for PSG.''' ,'''There are many things that I value, and many of them have nothing to do with my salary.''' ,'''Cristiano Ronaldo's a special player, but Messi's from another planet.''' ,'''I am happy at Madrid.''' ,'''I never said I wanted to leave Real Madrid. I never wanted that, but you have to move when they don't want you.''' ,'''Paris is a really nice city. My family has felt very good here from the first day they arrived. That makes it a lot easier for me to focus on football.''' ,'''It is difficult to adapt to Van Gaal. I had a couple of rows with him.''' ,'''As for anyone, it was a dream for me to come to Europe.''' ,'''That desire to win is something that's drummed into you at an early age in my country.

I come here to work and play for the club and to do the best I can for Manchester United.''' ,'''I've won an Olympic title and an U-20 World Cup, but it'd be really special to round things off with a Copa title with the seniors.''' ,'''Manchester United was a sad experience.

I've played for Real Madrid. Then I moved to Manchester United, from a giant to another giant.''' ,'''The problem is that when Argentina doesn't play well - and the same is true of Barcelona - the press think it is easy to blame Messi. We have seen time and time again that he wins games on his own when the team is not performing - but the media expect him to always be the hero.''' ,'''I honestly think I would swap all that I have won in my career to win something with the Argentine national team.''' ,'''Messi is the best in the world - there is no question about that.''' ,'''For sure, life takes many twists and turns, and one never knows what the future might hold.''' ,'''The first thing you learn is sacrifice and how to keep moving forward in life, helping your parents to put food on the table.

That's why, every time I pull on the Argentina shirt or any other, I think about the things that happened to me when I was a kid.''' ,'''I think there can be nothing more special than winning something with the shirt of your national team.''' ,'''I have these amazing feelings about having moved to Man U.

They absolutely wanted me, and it happened.''' ,'''If you change, it's because you want to. I will never change, and I never could change because the people around me are the same people who have always been there. My friends are the same, and that means you can never forget where you came from.''' ,'''Things didn't quite work out at Manchester United for various reasons, but that's in the past.''' ,'''My dad worked all day. He would get up at five in the morning and didn't stop working until 10 at night, every day the same.''' ,'''The only club I couldn't play for is Newell's Old Boys because I am a fan of Rosario Central.''' ,'''I am not going to lie: I know that there are clubs that want to sign me and can match Real Madrid's demands.

I will stay if the club wants me to stay.''' ,'''It's up to the manager where and how every player should play, but I think every player should be comfortable in that position.''' ,'''Life in England was a bit difficult. It is not easy for a South American. Some people get on fine, and for others, it is harder to adapt.''' ,'''The real reason you want to give everything on the field is so your own fans go away happy.''' ,'''Making passes is what I prefer the most.''' ,'''I want to play for Central because I love the club.

It is what I like about football.''' ,'''In 2017, I was able to spend time with my family in Argentina, recharge my batteries, think about what had been achieved - I needed to change something to be better. I managed to score goals, make more assists: that is the important thing.''' ,'''I am aware of importance of the No.7 shirt. Cristiano Ronaldo had spoken to me at Real Madrid and told me how important it was.''' ,'''There are no words to describe Messi; he always surprises you.''' ,'''Along with my teammates, we have a lot more great things to achieve, and we will continue to help PSG grow as a big club internationally. The support of all those that love this club will help us go beyond our own limits and defend our colours with passion and determination.''' ,]
