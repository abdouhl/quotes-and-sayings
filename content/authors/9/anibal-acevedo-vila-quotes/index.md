quotes = ['''Washington is a very complicated city. You have to work the personal relationships. They are politicians, they are congressmen, they are senators, but they are human beings. And for them to get to know you on a personal level really, really makes the difference.''' ,'''I believe - and so do most Puerto Ricans - that the ideas that will prevail in the new century will be those similar to the basic principles of commonwealth, of national reaffirmation, and political and economic integration among the peoples of the world.''' ,'''Since its inception, the American nation has had on its official seal the following motto: 'e pluribus unum,' which in Latin means, 'from the many, one.' That would change dramatically if Puerto Rico were to become a state.''' ,'''A 97-percent win is the kind of result you get in a one-party regime.''' ,'''The war in Iraq has fractured the political will of the United States and the world.''' ,'''We must all work together to bring the best to Puerto Rico.''' ,'''If there is a problem with democracy, the answer has to be more democracy.''' ,'''Thank God for paper ballots.''' ,'''Statehood is not a model for economic development; it is simply a way to organize a federation. What statehood does in fiscal and economic terms is apply uniform rules of the game to all states.''' ,'''Puerto Ricans, it doesn't matter where they live, it doesn't matter how long it's been since they visited the island, their hearts are there. If you keep them informed, and if you say to them, 'This is important for Puerto Rico, go and call your congressman,' they do it. They do it.''' ,'''You defend the truth no matter what.''' ,'''Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens, but by their own choice, Puerto Rico is not a state. The relationship has worked well for Puerto Rico - which has strengthened its culture, language and economy - and for the United States, which has helped create in Puerto Rico a showcase of democracy and prosperity for all of Latin America.''' ,'''Grant us more powers, not less; grant us more democracy, not less; grant us the tools to move forward because, I can assure you, Puerto Rico will move forward. We did it in the past; we will do it again.''' ,'''Nobody can doubt Puerto Rico, sociologically, linguistically, culturally, and historically, is a nation. We have our own rich culture, thousand years of history, unique territory, and almost everyone's first language is Spanish, not English.''' ,'''The common goals of Puerto Rico and the United States have always been for the benefit of both.''' ,'''I believe that Attorney Fortuno has some styles that it seems to me are going to foster dialogue and good communication, and I hope I am not mistaken.''' ,'''I'm not going to impose my vision on the people of Puerto Rico.''' ,'''Commonwealth is the only alternative for Puerto Rico. It is the only alternative that harmonizes the aspirations and goals of the modern world by protecting Puerto Rico's identity and simultaneously guaranteeing its relationship with the United States, complete with a common market, common citizenship, common defense, and common currency.''' ,'''With great powers come great responsibilities; with plenary powers come plenary responsibilities.''' ,'''Even when we were under the Spanish flag, we had a movement that just wanted assimilation into Spain, a movement of autonomy - which has been the majority always - and a movement for separation. In that sense, Puerto Rico's political reality is very different from any place I know in the whole world.''' ,'''The majority of the people of Puerto Rico support commonwealth.''' ,]
