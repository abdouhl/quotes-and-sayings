Michele Bachmann and Fox News would have us believe that the whole thing is 'political fiction.'''' ,'''For the past 25 years as an adoption attorney, I have witnessed the extraordinary courage and compassion of women - from age 14 to 40 - facing unplanned pregnancy. Not once did I believe that the government should interfere with their personal and private decision.''' ,'''Unplanned pregnancy is an equal-opportunity affliction.''' ,'''I stand with the majority of Americans who believe that women will make the right choice for their families and everyone will win.''' ,'''Politics was sort of a way of life in our family.''' ,'''I represented women with unplanned pregnancies from age 14 to 40, and they range from living in their car to living in the nicest neighborhoods in town.''' ,'''Make no mistake: I will work with both Democrats and Republicans to cut wasteful spending and reduce our debt in a balanced, responsible way.''' ,]
