- I don't have a Twitter account.

- But here's the thing: I had this great job, and I would still feel terribly depressed. I would just be like, 'This isn't the sweet spot. I thought this would be it, and I don't feel happy.'
- When moms and dads put their kids in acting class, good luck. Because you're just filling them with stuff they don't need yet.

- I love... anything in black and white. Just put it on the TV, I'll watch.
- I'm a total nerd.

- My family and school life are important to me.

- I pray every night. I just talk to God and I can go to sleep. I don't worry anymore.
- Kissing Macaulay Culkin was like kissing a brother. It was really no big deal.

- There were a lot of signs being thrown at me, a lot of angels I was meeting, inspiring me to get back into show business.
- Growing up it was the exception because I was maybe the only one in my school or my circle of friends that had that experience. But now that I know more people in the industry, I am realizing this happens to almost everybody.
