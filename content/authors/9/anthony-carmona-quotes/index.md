quotes = ['''The prominence given to our nation as a rainbow country has its genesis and credence in our 'Calaloo culture' of which our East Indian brothers and sisters have played a principal part.''' ,'''We are the first to honour the memories of those who perished through slavery, by declaring August 1 as Emancipation Day.''' ,'''Change is the only constant, and to turn one's back and pretend that it is not coming is an exercise in futility.''' ,'''Peace and security of our planet must be based on the collective action of all nations, not a few, however powerful they may be.''' ,'''It is important that you appreciate that the workplace must be a place of empowerment, but the empowerment must not only be connected to the job that you do.''' ,'''We have to replace our focus on personalities with a focus on ideas so that the opinionated and self-serving pronouncements and forms of cyber-bullying are replaced by thoughtful dialogue and open-minded conversation.''' ,'''I am from the bush. The bush did not define me. I did not stay in the bush, but I never forgot where I came from.''' ,'''You must stand for something! It does not have to be grand, but it must be a positive that brings light to someone else's darkness.''' ,'''As much as with increased exploration new gas reserves can be found, what must be obvious to all is that our oil and gas reserves are not renewable and they are diminishing, and to protect the generations to come, we must engage in nothing short of a radical shift in the diversification of the economy.''' ,'''I've always believed that the artiste is the one who has his pulse on the society and who, in many ways, represents the conscience of society in terms of engaging standards that we need to live by.''' ,'''Humility is the armour that you clothe yourself with throughout your life. We demean each other rather than lift up ourselves.''' ,'''Globalisation must have, as a critical component, international dispensation in the locality of U.N. institutions. It cannot be, and must not be, business as usual in the establishment and location of international institutions, especially of the United Nations.''' ,'''I can recall, as a young adult, running through the rain forest at the Forest Reserve, at times feeling a sense of fear when I felt I was in danger. In danger of confronting an ugly snake or a coral snake, which represented the greatest fear of someone in a rural area when you traverse the forest.''' ,'''Don't we realise that the student of today is the executive of tomorrow?''' ,'''Social media websites are no longer performing an envisaged function of creating a positive communication link among friends, family and professionals. It is a veritable battleground, where insults fly from the human quiver, damaging lives, destroying self-esteem and a person's sense of self-worth.''' ,'''I sometimes detect that a type of regional divide is setting in, and there is a lack of real Caribbean connection among the islands, and I am concerned about this.''' ,'''Do not let where you come from define you, but never forget the values you learned from your close community.''' ,'''There is a continuous stream of opinions on governance issues expressed daily, not only in our Parliament and in the print media, but also on talk-radio and social media.''' ,'''Our traditional oil and gas philosophy does not have conservation as a crucial component, and we can ill afford to continue to spend billions of dollars which are not reflected in the improved human capital of our country.''' ,'''We all ran barefooted on the dusty roads in our past, but now the Emperor wears shoes, and it is our responsibility to ensure that the barefooted child and the doting mother are afforded a holistic environment to realise their dreams and ambitions.''' ,'''Respect all manner of men regardless of their station in life. Compassion is one of the greatest virtues.''' ,'''It is indeed fitting for me to make a comment to the effect that it takes a village to raise a child because I have lived in many villages down in deep south, and everyone there who played a part in my stewardship as a young man growing up and as a professional, they have given me unstinting support.''' ,'''Empowerment is not about doing the same thing the same way in the same environment. It's about building the man and the woman and doing so with a view to creating better citizens and, by extension, better patriots in this society of ours.''' ,]
