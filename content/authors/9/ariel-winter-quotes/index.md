- I take breaks from social media periodically because I think it is healthy to walk away and focus on the life that's in front of you instead of the life happening on your screen.
- Be your own person and don't listen to anyone who says differently. We are all unique!

- I've always done pretty well in auditions. I just go in and give it my best shot.
- Having every little aspect of your life in the public eye is really hard because it leaves more room for criticism, and I just want to live.
- I love when I go on set every day, because the camera people teach me camera terms and grip terms - I learn all these new terms from different people on the set and leave feeling all cool about myself when I go out places.
- I went through a lot of hate online, so I tried to change myself for a really long time. But people just kept hating on me no matter what I did. I decided that instead of pleasing these other people, I'll just spend that time pleasing myself.

- I'm that person who takes a makeup wipe at the end of the night to take all my makeup off. I don't sleep in makeup; I think it's so bad.
- I want to be the kind of actress where, if I'm in the press, I'm in for the right reasons - for my work. To be in the press about family drama is kind of embarrassing.

- If I go on dates, my mom is always with me. She's always there making sure I'm all right. Like if I go to see a movie with a boy, she'll go to dinner next door.
- Filming a movie is different from a TV show because film is a lot quicker, you get to see the character progress and grow all in one script, and in television, you wait for a weekly update on each character.
- I've seen young actresses have major falls from their career, and that's just not what I want.
- I have two lovely parents who support everything I do, two siblings, and three beautiful nieces. My house is always filled with laughter and fun!
- Mental illness doesn't need to be hidden or glorified. It should be normalized to where people feel comfortable sharing with their families and friends and know they're not alone. By opening up about my struggle, I'm hoping I can help someone who feels like they don't know what to do or when they can't accept their situation.

- It was really helpful for me when I moved in with my sister, because she's the type of person that is confident in her body. I look up to her so much.

I never really saw that role model, so for me, that made me just want to be the opposite of what I had and treat people the opposite of the way I saw other people treat other people.
