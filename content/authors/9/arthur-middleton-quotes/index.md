- Many people experience Gethsemane moments.
- The Incarnation is the medicine of the soul, undoing the Fall and bringing man to the Tree of Life, and the office of a priest is to administer this medicine in the sacraments.
- Priesthood is forever and does not cease when a priest cannot carry out that priestly ministry.
- The task of a priest, in some respects, may be different today, but the principles upon which Herbert built his life as a priest are of universal application.

- Priesthood is not a convenient, historically conditioned form of Church organisation, but is rooted in the Incarnation, in the priesthood and mission of Christ himself.
- As priests uphold their people in prayer, so their people are to uphold them with prayer and love, for he cannot work without his people.
