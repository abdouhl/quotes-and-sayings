- Behind closed doors, Rob is a real teddy bear, a big softie.
- Rob is incredibly supportive. When I work he takes care of the kids and vice versa.
- Simon Cowell is trying to get everyone to clone their dogs, and we've had our dogs 'done' so they can't have puppies any more. Cloning is like modern day reproducing - reproducing the bits you want.
- I was a bit of a humour black sheep. I would make these jokes full of irony and dark cynicism and that just didn't work when I was seven, people did not laugh.
- I had this career and then I was working and then I met Rob and then I kind of went off and got married and had kids, and in that process, which was amazing and fantastic, I lost my confidence as an actress and as a working woman.
- There are such wonderful blessings in my life - I have this amazing baby, an amazing family, and I loved X Factor - all these moments of joy, and then these sharp drop-offs. I'd be awake, lying in bed, crying. There's these weird moments of misplaced anger I have.
- I have zero filters.
- We've got eight dogs, a cat, a turtle, kids... yeah we have a lot of dogs. It's a lot of fur, it's a lot of poop... and that's not even counting Robbie. He's the hairiest most feral animal of all.
- I love Stoke-on-Trent, it is where Rob grew up.
- I know what it is like to lose your confidence.
- I didn't know what it would be like being on 'X Factor' with my husband. It's surpassed everything I could have expected.
- Rob loves my mum, I think the most in the whole world. They are two peas in a pod and I'm the one on the outside. It makes me even more in love with my husband and with my mum, because she can be bonkers and unconventional and it can be embraced.
- I took for the first time, I mean Rob is 42, for the first time I took him to the supermarket. He is really like a 15-year-old boy! He's just frozen in Take That time. He was like 'This is amazing they have everything!' I was like 'that's what you do at a supermarket.' It was a revelation for him.
- As women we try so hard to be perfect at everything, all the time. It's impossible.
- Therapy is so personal but it can be a really amazing tool so long as you are not forced into it.
- I'm just very talky, as you can imagine.
- I have to audition for everything; there is no Mrs. Robbie Williams free pass, and because I'm working with British actors everyone is so polite - no one mentions Robbie.
- I still have to hustle to get jobs, audition and put myself out there.
- If it was up to Rob we would be eating Nandos and salad cream, morning, noon and night!
- But I like the chaos. As long as it's happy chaos.
- I always had an oddball sense of humour.
- I'm always saying to myself, there aren't enough hours in the day, which I think any working mum says to herself.
- Robbie minced into my life and he had the same oddball sense of humour as me. It was love at first laugh.
- Rob and I both have this strange sense of comedy which always involves us being the butt of our own jokes.
- Listen, my dad left me, my mom is crazy, I'm from L.A., a pop star dumped me three times and I'm an actress who gets rejected constantly.
- I don't think Rob has ever auditioned for anything aside from Take That.
- I can't not work - I love acting.
- Being parents suits us. Having kids has been the best thing for both of us.
- I tested against Kaley Cuoco for 'The Big Bang Theory.' Not getting that hurts.
- I've never really minded being Mrs. Robbie Williams because my ego is relatively small, but it is really nice now that people know there is something else there besides that.
- Rob and I both have a problem with taking jokes too far.
- For years, I was 'just' a stay at home mum and wife - which, by the way, is harder than any other job I've ever had.
- What I want in my career is different to what I wanted when I was 21. It's got to be something that keeps my family together, that allows me to be present in their lives.
- Well, I love Take That but l've always been partial to Robbie Williams' songs.
- I love British television. I love the irony, I love the authenticity and I love the roles I get put up for.
