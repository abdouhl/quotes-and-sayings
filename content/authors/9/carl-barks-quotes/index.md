quotes = ['''I enjoyed doing the gag covers better than the story ones because they were usually simpler.

And it had to make sense on its own.''' ,'''I've always looked upon the Ducks as caricature human beings. Perhaps I've been years writing in that middle world that J.R.R. Tolkien describes, and never knew it.''' ,'''I always felt myself to be an unlucky person like Donald, who is a victim of so many circumstances. But there isn't a person in the United States who couldn't identify with him.
