- I can't stand Bob Dylan.
- The cast and the crew made me feel really welcome. Towards the end it just got better and better.
- I know bugger all about golf.
- I'm curvy and wholesome.
- I'm just experimenting with every different type of music you can imagine and seeing where my voice lies and what sounds best. I think when I do finally do the album it will be very eclectic - just loads of different stuff on it. That's what I am hoping.
- When I try to get work in the US all they say is that I need to lose weight - but I bet they never said that to Mae West.
- I would quite like to do a different accent or play something so different from myself because Olivia, the character I play in this film, is similar to me.
- Since I was 12 or 13, I have been taking movie meetings finding a project right for me because I wanted to try it. Craig gave us the script - it was set in Wales, it is really British humour. I just loved it.
- I love singing - singing is what I'm famous for doing. Now it's turned into things I am famous for doing - like having rows with my mum or about my boyfriend, so it does get irritating.
- There are some truths to some of the stories, but a lot of it isn't - you just have got to let it go.
- They never were planning to be here. All my family are going to London because they wanted to go to the big one. There was never any showdown - there wouldn't be.
- It was quite natural - the first day I got to the set I was really nervous, but I loved the whole experience.
- They used to but not any more. You kind of get used to it - you accept it is part of your job - if you're famous and you want this life, you have got to accept this part of it as well.
