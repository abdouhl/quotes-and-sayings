- If you talk about Lindsay Lohan for four or five days a week, you really can't bear to talk about her on the weekends.
- MTV is known for their huge budget.
- There's a difference between racism and people making a joke about something. There is true racism going on, and people should be able to identify what that is, comparatively.

- I'm into politics, and I love watching the heavier news magazine shows.

- I'm actually a big fan of Kathy Griffin because I think she's really funny. I think she's really self-deprecating, which is something I like to see in a comedian. I think those are really the best comedians: people who can make fun of themselves.
- If you're really looking to hurt somebody's feelings, just break up with them.
- I thought I'd become an actress, but then I realized I eat too much.
- I think comedy has to come from your authentic point of view.

- It's a dream come true to have someone else portray me. Because I've been living this life for a long time, and I'm over myself.
- I try not to apologize, especially publicly. That's a slippery slope, because I'm a comedian. If you take anything I'm saying too seriously, then you shouldn't be paying attention in the first place. If you find me offensive, don't follow me.
- If you're a member of my family, whether immediate or extended, and you want to see my show, don't.
