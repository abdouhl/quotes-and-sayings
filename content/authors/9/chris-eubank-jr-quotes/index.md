- For my training camp against George Groves my main sparring partner was a 6ft 7inch cruiserweight who fought nothing like George. It was just wrong. Wrong preparation. I was as fit as could be, but strategically I didn't prepare right.
- I'm human. When you lose, of course you're going to be upset. It's a horrible feeling.
- As an amateur, I trained in some real hard schools of knocks. In Cuba, they would have judges on three sides of the ring just for sparring sessions. They train under exactly the same conditions as they fight, and it was a great experience.
- Having the Eubank name in England brings lots of pressure.
- Technically, my fight with Korobov should have been for the full world title, not the interim.

- There is nobody that I wouldn't fight.

- The corner is there to help you clean your cuts up and put your Vaseline on, not to throw in the towel.
- With my fight style - speed and volume punching - it would be an amazing fight. Golovkin is a come-forward fighter. It would be fireworks, a fight that the fans would enjoy. Because of my style, I would stop him due to the pure amount of punches. Whether it's a cut or he gets tired, stopping him would definitely be on the cards.

- Was there any danger I could have gone down a different path were it not for boxing? Of course.
- I want to be able to prove I can become the same or better than my father.
- There was always a lot of pressure - I fought on Channel 5 in my first fight and got two million views - but luckily I'm the kind of person who thrives under pressure. I use it to fuel my performances and training, knowing that all eyes are on me and that there's a lot to live up to. It made me harder, tougher and more determined.
- I started to understand how important it was for me to make my own name pretty early on after years of noticing people treating me a certain way because of who my dad was. Some people wanted to be friends, others wanted to test me because I was Chris Eubank's son - inside schools, outside of school, on the streets.
- I have fought fighters in the past who I don't like as people, but you have to block out any type of dislike or hate. Whatever he's done, whatever he's said, you can't be thinking about that. You just have to see him as a man that you have to outpoint, outgame, and beat on the night.

- I'm around my father all of the time, so the things that people see as distracting are things I've seen for years on a daily basis. It's second nature to me.
- Froch is like a train who just comes forward but Groves will move about, fake and feign and his good footwork is a big part of his game.
- I have an amazing fan base. I also have an amazing amount of haters: believe who don't believe, people who don't want me to succeed. I don't really mind having those people around.

- There is a lot of pressure because of what my father achieved and everyone is expecting so much, but that gives me that extra drive in the gym every day to graft hard.
- In the ring I'm a different animal.
- Boxing is an entertainment business.
- I got cut against Groves, and I couldn't see out of my eye most of the fight but it didn't hurt. Groves probably weighed 13 1/2 stone whereas I weighed 12. But he never buzzed me. It was just that cut, which looked so bad, with blood everywhere.
- I would never put my career on hold for anybody.
- Some fighters lose and their spirits are forever broken. A champion comes back stronger. If you're constantly dwelling on the past, 'I could have done that, I should have done this,' it doesn't help. You have to look at the situation intellectually and learn from it.
- If the going gets tough, you stay in there and take your beating like a man. That's what we sign up for, and that's all I meant when I said my corner don't throw in towels.
- I look up to my father, he's done what he's done, and I want to emulate his achievements and become as successful as he was. But I have to prove myself to the boxing community and to myself - that's the most important thing.

- No man can honestly sit there and say he doesn't care about what people think, doesn't care if he's got the support of the British public or British fans.
- It's definitely hard to live up to expectation. Especially early in my career, everyone was expecting so much from me, everyone was comparing me to my father. They didn't understand that they're comparing me to a world champion, which is very unfair as a novice.
- Outside boxing, I did well in cross country competitions and I won a schoolboys' doubles badminton tournament at once. I was pleased because it was a hobby to me.
- Any fighter who is serious about boxing wants to be in those big fights, fighting the best fighters, with the whole country watching and talking about it.
- So many fighters who fight Golovkin have lost before they've entered the ring.
- There shouldn't be any true malice towards your opponent.
- Obviously, in the buildup to some fights, there's animosity and testosterone and banter. But at the end of the day, we all understand that this is a business, just two men who are trying to further their careers and provide for their families.
- Anyone with a belt in my weight division I want to fight.
- I want the hardest, toughest challenges out there for me.
- I've never wanted to be your average Joe. I've always wanted to stand out from the crowd - to be someone looked at and admired, and scrutinised. I'd much rather be scrutinised or criticised than have no one look at me at all.
- There's a very big difference between being fit and being fight fit. Sparring is the only way to get fight fit. It's a very important part of boxing and something that I do as regularly as possible.
- I went to Brighton College, Shoreham College for one year, then to Spring Valley High School in Las Vegas for a couple of years.
- If people knew what I have sacrificed then they'd understand why I put so much into every fight. This has pretty much been my life for as long as I can remember and the work that has been put in to make sure that I become the best fighter in the world means that there can't be no other way.
- I have trained on and off with Floyd and his father for many years now and I've learned a lot. His work ethic is second to none and it's great being around him and the 'Money Team.'
- The only time I've ever been knocked out in my entire life was in a rugby game when I was about 13. I used to play on the wing. The opposing winger has the ball in his hand and he's running full speed at me. I go down to tackle him and he jumps up and his knee hits my temple.

- I don't see a holiday as a time to break from boxing - it never stops.
- You can hit the bags, the pads, and you can run and do your fitness and your weights as much as you want, but if you don't spar you just don't have that true experience, that true knowledge of how to beat a man in one-on-one combat.
- When you are fighting a man who is over a stone heavier than you, you feel it. You feel it in the punches and in the clinches.

- This is no ordinary nine to five day job and I have a 24/7 in terms of my boxing and my career as a professional sportsman.
- If you look at champions, they came from nothing. That's where they get their drive and determination and hunger. They know they have no other option to succeed, because they had nothing. I had everything.
- Golovkin is the No 1 name on my list. People put this guy's name so high. But I know I can beat him. I know that I have the tools and the style to take this guy out.

- I was always hugely into sport before I started boxing. I played rugby, football, cricket, athletics, swimming.

- I've had the hardest upbringing of any fighter in England.
- You learn from every bout.
- The truth is I've trained myself for much of my career.
- Everyone's entitled to their opinion about my father. Some people think he's a distraction and takes some of my shine away, but, for me, that's not the case.
- I see myself as the best fighter in the world and that's because I have to. There can't be any other way. I can't go into a fight with the other names that are around my weight, who want the same as me, and not believe that I'm better than them.

- No man is unbeatable.
- I've been working a lot on my jab.

I was in the first teams for all the sports at Brighton, played on the wing in rugby, and ran 100m, 200m, 400m, and did long jump and even the javelin at one point. In the States I did a bit of track, but mainly I was there for the boxing.
- Any fighter worth his salt wants to be the best and to be the best you have to fight the best.
