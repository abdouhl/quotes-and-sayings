quotes = ['''In the '60s when I was a student, there was this campaign to destroy 75 percent of the old buildings in Paris, replacing them with modern architecture. I realized this as a dangerous utopia. This modern vision did not understand the richness of the city. Thankfully, such destruction did not happen.''' ,'''An architect must remember that the people working or living in his building need space - to dream, to be quiet, to find beauty somewhere.''' ,'''When I am true to my inspiration, even fight for my design, the project always turns out well.''' ,'''When I was 18, I lived in Greenwich Village, New York, for nine months.
