Now that I am without you, all is desolate; all that was once so beautiful is dead.''' ,'''I love you, what star do you live on?''' ,'''Separate we come, and separate we go, And this be it known, is all that we know.''' ,'''All lovely things will have an ending, All lovely things will fade and die; And youth, that's now so bravely spending, Will beg a penny by and by.''' ,]
