Pitch 'em every three days and you'd find they'd get control and good, strong arms.''' ,'''One of the fellows called me 'Cyclone' but finally shortened it to 'Cy' and its been that ever since.''' ,'''A pitcher's got to be good and he's got to be lucky to get a no hit game.''' ,'''Gosh, all a kid has to do these days is spit straight and he gets forty-thousand dollars to sign.''' ,'''I thought I had to show all my stuff and I almost tore the boards of the grandstand with my fastball.''' ,]
