We are going to root out corruption, and that is a promise I can make.''' ,'''My campaign to become leader of the ANC was pivoted on two things: Renewing the ANC and taking back to the values the were espoused and subscribed to by Nelson Mandela, Oliver Thambo, and many other leaders.''' ,'''Some say the Constitution has robbed us of a proper land redistribution process. Others would want to look at other clauses. Well, it's South Africa. Everything is transparent and open for debate.''' ,'''Everyone has to be receptive to the decisions of the ANC because that is the political center.

The ANC that will work for the people.''' ,'''Somewhere in the depths of my soul is the connection my father had with his cattle, the hills of Khalavha, and his people.''' ,'''It is not the function of the leader of government business to discipline members of the executive.''' ,'''We must listen to the concerns of our people without dismissing them. When people see something wrong, there is something wrong. When our people see corruption, it means there is corruption. When our people see that their resources are being stolen by certain people, it means this is happening, and we should listen.''' ,'''We should draw deep into Madiba's wisdom. We should draw deep into Madiba's style of doing things in an orderly manner, in a purposeful manner, in a way where we focus.''' ,'''We can make this country the garden of Eden.''' ,'''As members of the executive, we are accountable to Parliament.''' ,'''Young people must feel that they can be real actors in our economy and be creative and be imaginative and be innovative.''' ,'''Issues to do with corruption, issues of how we can straighten out our state-owned enterprises, and how we deal with 'state capture' are issues that are on our radar screen.''' ,'''We have brave hearts and won't retreat. We are not going back; we are going forward.''' ,'''Corruption in state-owned enterprises and other public institutions has undermined our government's programs to address poverty and unemployment.''' ,'''There is nothing wrong with students demanding free education, and, in fact, it is something that our children deserve.''' ,'''Apartheid was baked hard in the mining industry because that's where it originated.''' ,'''Violence against women and children resembles an epidemic. It has spread through society, sparing no social group or class.''' ,'''We want to renew our vows with our people. We want to reconnect with our people.

Men need to organise themselves in a sustained campaign against gender-based violence.''' ,'''The country is yearning to put behind all these horrible things that have to do with corruption, state capture, behind us. The sooner these are all done, the better, because we want to move on; we want to move on to a better life.''' ,'''The ANC must ensure that South Africa does not become a mafia state because once you reach that state, all the wheels have come off.''' ,'''We are a big economy, and we must, therefore, show that we can manage it, but not only manage it, but that can transform it so that this economy works for all of our people so that everyone feels that they have a stake in this economy.''' ,'''When I was appointed deputy president, I accepted it, and it is the president's prerogative to appoint or remove anyone to the Executive.''' ,'''Leaders are meant to lead from the front, but at the same time, they are also meant to listen to what their followers are saying.''' ,'''South Africa must come first in everything we do.''' ,'''It is important that South Africans of all political persuasions be represented in Parliament.''' ,'''We want young people to come forward with bright ideas; we want the women and men in our country to have jobs.''' ,'''What we want is for our young people to be skilled.''' ,'''The expropriation of land without compensation should be among the mechanisms available to government to give effect to land reform and redistribution.''' ,'''Students want free education because their parents are struggling. The fees of universities and technikons are too high.''' ,'''I believe that our economy is not a one- or two-percent growth economy; I believe it can grow at four percent, and we can revitalize our economy if we do the right things.''' ,'''Whenever you go through the length and breadth of our country... you see a long face: you will see the long face of an African woman because she's black, because she's poor.''' ,'''If we are not honest, we are not going to be able to forge unity.''' ,'''Free education for all - whilst it is a desirable notion, in South Africa it will simply not be affordable.''' ,'''We must stop the division among us.
