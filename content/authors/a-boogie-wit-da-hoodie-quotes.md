- My mom is proud of me. My pops proud of me. Everybody keeps motivating me.
- I wasn't really comfortable going to college.
- I was inspired to shoot 'Look Back at It' in a high school because I'm like a voice of the youth. When the youth sees me in a classroom, I want them to be inspired to accomplish their dreams. I was just like them in a classroom at one point. It all starts in a classroom.

- I found my sound through exploring. I was in the studio yelling, going low, trying things, and that's how I found that I have a lot of sounds.
- I was trying to make my name just Artist in the beginning, but it was weird at first, because I wasn't an R&B singer or nothing. Not an R&B singer. I didn't do no melodic songs, none of that yet.

- A lot of people don't know that: that Artist is my name.

- Why do you think my name is Artist? I'm an artist.

- I was raised hearing music everywhere I went.
- One day, walking through the Bronx streets, I just realized that people were stopping me, taking pictures, and noticing me from across the street. I can't even use public transportation anymore, so I kind of stopped going places and started going straight to the studio, going home, and telling people I can't go anywhere anymore.

- Most of the time, I'm making music. There'll be moments of my life where I feel like I gotta to take a break and come back to the music. It's hard to explain, but you need to get a break from it and then come back to it. It's like you gotta lose something to appreciate it.
- New York sounds like something that I could really listen to. It's like a vibe; it's a hit song. It's a song that you could listen to in five years and still like.
- I'm not the type of person who makes a lot of songs in a day just to see which one is the best.

- You always gonna feel me. That's my main thing. When I'm speaking in my music, you gotta feel me.
- I pick and choose what I want to put on what. Instead of just dropping a single, I like putting projects together.
- I used to record songs, like, play the beat from one phone and have another phone recording me and just rap. Moving from that to a studio was like, 'Damn, I never knew I could sound like this.' It was just magic.
- Everybody was always telling me to rap and freestyle. I used to go to the park and spit on the mic. If I go to the park, they always gonna give me the mic.
- I'm not really rocking with mixtapes no more. EPs and albums - that's it.
- No matter where I'm at in life, whether I'm in the music industry, rich, poor, everybody need love in their life. Gangsta or not, everybody need love in their life. You can't act too hard about that.
- I can't even lie: Sometimes, I be antisocial.

- Every time I step on stage an' see all of the lights or hear fans singing the words to my songs ,it's a surreal moment for me.
