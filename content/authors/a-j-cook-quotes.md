- I have a whole closet in my house that's dedicated just to jackets and coats, stuff that I've collected over the years.
- I have some amazing fans! They're just so dedicated and so nice and so sweet. I'm, like, no one and I'm just starting out, and these people appreciate your work and it's nice to hear that.
- It's so easy to get used to playing a role. Then all of the sudden when you're tossed out of it, it's almost like you have to remember how to act again!
- 'The Fight Club' DVD is great. I like anything that has really good extras because as an actor, it's really great to see the behind-the-scenes stuff and see how different actors approach their particular project.
- I am just your everyday, average girl. I live by the beach. I wear flip flops. I don't wear make-up. I go to the gym.
- I really like suspenseful movies and movies that make you think.
- There are some things I wish I never knew, but I am grateful for things that I have learned, too.
- My husband and I are just really laid back people.
- I really like 'The Three Kings' DVD. I love that movie and all the extra footage and documentaries.
- For me, if something fits properly, it makes me feel good.
- A lot of times you have to dip into the independent world to find the really great projects and the really great scripts. They're out there - you just have to search hard.
