- For me, exercise is a form of meditation and I find it very calming.
- I never try to look for love but sometimes it finds me.

- If you're gonna do a job, do it properly.

- I want to show people what I'm about - not just, 'Here's my celebrity partner this year that I'm going to showcase.'
- I'm very proud of what I do and anything I do I represent, I feel like myself and my brand and if somebody's trying to be negative, I don't really read comments online.
- Focus is the secret to success. Focus and enjoying whatever it is you're doing.
- When I was asked to take part in 'Celebrity Hunted' I jumped at the chance, who wouldn't want to run wild around the U.K. for two weeks being chased by a top secret service type team, whilst raising money for a cause very close to my heart - cancer.

- I feel really passionate now that talking with family, friends, or a counsellor is the way to deal with negative situations and difficult times.
