- I have had unsuccessful films, but I learned a lot from those films. I give my failures as much importance as my success.
- For me, the driving emotion of selecting a film is that I just love that story. It may give a message, it may not give a message - that's fine. I just loved it.
- I feel that, in India, we have films that have tackled various issues over the years, but perhaps one of the issues that we've tackled less is the issue of caste-ism. That's an issue we've more or less stayed away from... although we touched on it briefly in some films like 'Lagaan.'
- Creative people have no barriers. Ultimately, it's connecting with human beings. There's just one planet. I don't see it as different countries.
- The way actors interact with their audience via Twitter is a part of their personality. So if I interact less, that is a part of my personality. I am mostly lost in my own world.
- Our choices are quite different: what attracts Salman and Shah Rukh are, I think, quite different from what attracts me. So in that sense, we are quite different, but I think we are fortunate to have had the kind of success that we've had.
- When material comes to me, I don't care where it's coming from. Japan, Singapore, China, Africa... it could be from everywhere. The material should excite me. It's not important where it's coming from.
- For me, acting is not a job. It is something I love. I don't do these things for awards or rewards. I do them because I love challenges.
- As an actor, the best way I can hope to promote greater social understanding is through my work. If I can communicate with people and touch their hearts through 'Dangal,' perhaps, eventually, I can help change their minds.
- The journey that I have undertaken, meeting people from all walks of life and learning from them, has been my biggest achievement.
- If 10 people see my movie and all ten really love it, then that means a lot to me, rather than ten million people go and see it and most of them hate it.
- I don't believe in strategies. I love what I am doing; that's the main thing.
- Essentially, it is the director who is the creative head of a film. The final authority on all decisions lies with the director. That is how it should be. And then other team members can give their creative inputs.
- If the role is challenging enough, I don't see why I shouldn't play an older man or a father figure. It is not about playing what you are in real life. We are called actors for a reason!
- Many people, including me, thought it was too early for me to play a father to two grown-up daughters, but I found the script of 'Dangal' irresistible. I had to do it!
- When I am shooting a film, then everything goes soft focus. My family also complains that I don't give them time.
- There must be a story within him/her that wants to come out. That's the reason why 'Dil Chahta Hai,' 'Lagaan,' and 'Rang De Basanti' worked so well: Ashutosh, Farhan, and Rakesh had a story inside them. It's very important that the director should have the fire in the belly to tell the story.
- When I was new, I didn't know where my career will go. Initially, my films were not even successful, but then I learned a lot from my mistakes.
- I am not a perfectionist. Perfection doesn't exist in real life. It's a wrong title for me.
- I understand that I'm able to connect with people; I have an emotional bonding with people. My strength lies in my ability to tell stories and to touch people's hearts and to move them.
- My films are so new and unique that I don't know where I will end up. Fear keeps me alert. And it's also a part of an excitement.
- I am happy that I have entertained people and made them happy.
- I don't see myself as an activist. I understand that people, with me doing 'Satyameva Jayate,' for example, they will feel that I'm being an activist, but I'm not. Actually, I'm not, because I think an activist, as I see it, as a person who is very, very - takes up one issue and remains with that one issue for his entire life. I'm not doing that.
- I do what I feel is right. I am not scared to walk on the new path and take risk.
- When I prepare for a role, I try to get inside the character's head and understand him.
