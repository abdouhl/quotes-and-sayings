- My wife and I do not argue. We communicate. We talk. But we've never fought in our entire relationship.

- 'Breaking Bad' was such a high plateau.

- I love diving into different skins, skins that make me feel deep emotions.
- You can tell if you're going to be into a script within the first five or ten pages - if I'm not completely engaged by page 20, I just have to give up on it.

- I've grown so much, not just as an actor, but as a human being.

- 'Breaking Bad' has definitely opened many, many doors for me.
- It's so funny, I've done so many projects where I've been interrogated. I guest starred on almost every hour drama, and I'm always the guy they think is the bad guy but then they find out is not.
- When you're mid-season, in very intense situations, it's hard not to take that home with you. Especially when you're sleeping, you can't control what you dream about. And it sneaks into the unconscious.
- The first part of my career, how I was paying the bills was commercials. I was just doing tons of commercials.
- My father's a Southern Baptist minister. I wasn't lighting cars on fire; I just wasn't.
- I moved out to Los Angeles a fan of many people, and meeting people I put on a pedestal that just disappointed me. Without fans, this business would not exist, so I try and say that we're all on the same level.

- It was the roughest day of my career, my final day of shooting on 'Breaking Bad,' knowing that I will never be able to kind of zip on that skin again.
- My dad didn't want me to listen to Zeppelin, I think because it reminded him of his wilder days, and now he's a retired Southern Baptist minister.

- I have 14 nieces and nephews.
- I'm just in love with Burberry. Always have been, always will be.

- I'm trying to have some longevity in this business. If that means not working for a while and just picking the right job, so be it.
- A lot of people get emotional in movies that are cartoons, but not in TV shows.
- I consider myself absolutely a character actor, and that's what I want as a career. I don't need to be the lead star or any of that, as long as I'm doing stuff that I'm proud of, really.
- I mean, I've never really had much security, to be honest.
- That's what's so great about television. You're able to tell this long story, where you couldn't really do that in a film because you have to tell a story in an hour and a half or two hours.
- I always gravitate towards the independent side of things, just because those are the stories I always fall in love with, but you don't really get paid, and living in Los Angeles is expensive, and I have a mortgage to pay. So it's good to jump onto a studio film and then in all my other time do small passion projects.
- With this film, 'Need For Speed,' with this, we had a blank canvas to work with. What we had to do was have fast cars, and that's it.
- My favourite job hands down - and I think I can speak for everyone involved - was 'Breaking Bad.'
- I've been a fan of Burberry for a very long time and they've been so supportive of me for many years.
- You feel like you're really a part of a movement when you're singing Journey at a karaoke bar.
- The first album I ever bought with my own money was 'Ten.' Every single song reminds me of my childhood.
- It's so hard for me to kind of fall in love with comedy, but if something comes my way... I mean, I loved 'Weird,' I thought that was a really fun character.
- I was very driven in high school. I worked a bunch of odd jobs. I never partied. I never drank. I was just a theater geek who was obsessed with movies.
- I took a whole stunt course and pretty much got certified as a stunt driver. It's ridiculous how easy it is once you understand the car and know how to do it.
- If everyone were a good person, it'd obviously be a better world.
- I knew that I tend to always gravitate to the indie side of things.
- I gravitate toward edgy, intense, dark films that just grab you by the throat.
- I love coming of age stories that have struggle.
- I definitely had a very religious upbringing. My father was just instilling good morals into us at a very young age, and it wasn't super-strict, but it was a loving, warm household.
- On a big film, there's almost no way you can meet everyone. On an indie, there are 30 people and no trailers to duck into.
- I've been snowboarding my whole life. My wife's really good, and I just try to keep up with her.
- I always gravitate towards characters that are so opposite of me.
- I was on the snowboard team at my school, but that was the only sports team I was on. I played soccer growing up in elementary school.
- Yeah, I left Idaho at 17. You know, I graduated high school a year early and just, you know, the typical story, packed up my car and moved out.
- From the very beginning, I've always just wanted to do something I've never done before. I'm still just trying to be on that path. It's all about working with filmmakers that you believe in.
- I'm a character actor.
- I get random meetings, like, 'Ron Howard would like to sit down with you.' 'Really?' If 'Breaking Bad' hadn't happened, Ron Howard probably wouldn't want to sit down with me. Because he would have no idea who I was.
- It's very exciting to be able to just work in this business, let alone on stuff you are extremely proud of. So it does make me a little nervous, because 'Breaking Bad' is so special. It's great being part of something so great because people pay attention to you, hopefully because you're doing good work.
- My first gig was a Corn Pops commercial. I did the first Vanilla Coke campaign. A Juicy Fruit commercial paid my bills for years.
- I moved back to Idaho when I was 6 or 7 and then lived in a little town called Twin Falls and then moved to Boise. So quite different from L.A. I'd been to Disneyland a couple of times, and that was the closest I'd been to L.A.
