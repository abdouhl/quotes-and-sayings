- My world was completely different to other boys my age. When I was six I was earning money, and by 10 I was paying more tax than the parents of other pupils. I feel a lot older than my years. Because I was working with adults, I had to mature a lot quicker.
- I was raised by women. Now I'm raising women. I was always better around girls. I live in an all-female household. I even have two female dogs... It's funny how that turned out.
- I'm happy to say I'm a feminist. Being a feminist is just believing in equal rights. Man, woman, gay, straight, black, white - we're all in it together.
- For me, I can't watch violence when it's too grotesque, and it's just like, that's revolting to watch. I don't enjoy it. But when it's a Tarantino film, I'm lining up outside the door to see it, and I'm expecting to see something really crazy, a lot of blood, and for it to be funny.
- It's funny because if you ever ask anyone in England to try and do a Beatles accent, no one knows what they really sound like. If you ask anyone in America, they would try and give it a go. English people just know their songs.
- 'Pulp Fiction' was probably one of the first films I ever saw that really kind of took effect on me. I was about four years old - obviously wasn't supposed to be seeing that film; my sister kind of sneaked it out and we got to see it. She's older than me. That was something I always used to watch.
- I got into beards right in the middle of the hipster boom.
- I haven't got any friends from where I grew up, but that's not to do with fame.
- Life is more important than 'what film I do next.'
- I think with anything where you delve into the back story of an artist, it kind of explains their work more intimately.
- I was lucky enough, when I was younger, to have the chance to do as much as possible, and I found what I wanted to do. I did swimming, gymnastics, kickboxing and the one that took off more than the others was acting.
- I'm constantly trying to find something that's different from me, whereas some actors do the same thing, again and again. That's not for me.
- I wouldn't want to be a James Bond.
- I'll never be Jennifer Lawrence or Tom Cruise, someone who can hold a movie and then be charming and charismatic doing promotion. I haven't got what they've got. But at least I'm now comfortable just being myself.
- I love being a father. It's one of my big jobs is just being a parent. It's one of my favorite things I do.
- The problem with independent films is that they can be hit or miss. I've seen scripts that have blown me away. But there have to be all the right ingredients in place to make them work: the director, cast, publicity, distribution.
- My whole thing, my priority, is my family, my kids, and my wife. That's my future. I don't really care about what role is next.
- I like my world to be calm.
- Anyone who's got a guitar, you like to pick it up. I can play a couple of songs, some '50s rock and roll, a bit of Elvis. That's it, really - I'm not a musician, I'm not a singer.
- I did swimming, gymnastics, dance, and the acting was just a small part. I didn't have pushy parents; it wasn't forced upon me. They just said, 'See if you like it. If you do, great; if you don't, don't worry about it.' I was really fortunate to have that guidance and supportive parents.
- Only recently have I been introduced to the gym and heavy weightlifting and things like that. Before that, when I grew up, I just did a lot of gymnastics and dance. I had more of an athletic background, but nothing where I was in the gym or using any kind of weights.
- I'm not the kind of male who has to put my imprint on everything.
- If you agree to do a sex scene, you have to be willing to not be awkward about it. C'mon! I don't think of it as anything other than a dance, really. I don't see that person. I don't think of me being me.
- Whenever I read a script, I start recasting the role that I might play. I'm like, 'God, this should be played by Domhnall Gleeson, not me.'
- We have the ability to be able, if we have the right resources around us, to really do chop and change and have fun in our time and not just be stuck in one world or the other.
- I was brought up by my mum and my sister. I've always been around independent women; I like that. Anybody who's a fake I don't like and I don't talk to.
- I can't think of anything worse than trying to schmooze someone with the idea that you're an actor.
- I've achieved more than some people do in a lifetime, but it doesn't mean I've done it all.
- I get more fulfilment from being a father than I do from being an actor.
- I was never that kid who used to brag about anything.
- I'm a dad, and I can tell you it's the most beautiful thing in the world.
- I get on fine with my mum and dad, but if they want to see the grandchildren, they come to me.
- I want to work with great directors. I've picked films based on the script or the character and seen them collapse because the directors were not strong visionaries.
- I was always told at school that you had to have a back-up plan, but all I ever wanted to do was act. There was no plan B for me.
- There are so many elements that make a good film. You need a great director who's driving it.
- People look at stuff like 'Godzilla' and 'Avengers' and think I only do blockbusters, or however you wanna put it, but in reality, I can make double or triple what I got paid for 'Avengers' by doing other stuff - there are other options, but I don't want to work with this person or that person, and so I don't do it.
- I love gardening, and I love cooking. I love things like that. I love creating things.
- I don't analyse things, and I don't look back. I can think forward - but only about my family. I don't look outside that and certainly don't care what anyone else thinks.
- I don't like to be me. I'm not so comfortable being me on screen because then I'd be a presenter. I'm not Jimmy Fallon.
- I have to be fully committed to do a project nowadays, because if I say yes to something, it means the whole family are going to have to move for the job. It's a lot of upheaval. So, it has to be really worth it. Otherwise, I'd just as well not bother.
- I don't go online, I don't read reviews, I try not to look at anything on the Internet.
- The thing about travelling is that you work hard and play hard, but you can do all those things without your parents knowing.
- The buzz you get when you're playing a song and everyone is screaming and dancing and what have you and singing along is incredible.
