- I've always been a people pleaser.
- I truly believe that players who tell you they don't feel the pressure of international cricket, of being away from home for months at a time, are lying to everyone and themselves.
- I have been massively proud to have played for and, indeed, captain my country on the cricket field.
- I will continue to be the biggest supporter of Faf du Plessis and the Proteas.
- I believe all teams choke in certain situations.
- I rest a bit more when I keep. The only thing I have to look after is my back and using different muscle groups.
- As a captain, I can't make the same mistake twice. As a player, you can get away with that, but if the captain does that, then it affects the whole team.
- We want to swing the ball as much as we can. We try and get it to reverse, putting more sweat on one side and things like that. But we don't cheat.
- When I'm fielding at point, I'm running all over that field, and I'm really tired by the end of the innings.
- It's always been the most important thing for me to enjoy my cricket.
- Sometimes you don't quite realise what you have achieved until you look back.
- Far from being a mere consequence of winning, strong team spirit is an essential ingredient of sporting success; it comes before, not afterwards.
- Every wicket you play on is different.
- It will never be much fun until a Proteas team finally goes out and wins one of these ICC limited-overs tournaments. That will happen one day.

- I'm a bit undercooked when it comes to keeping in Test cricket, but I've had a lot of experience in T20 and ODIs for my country, and my keeping has improved a lot.
- The interests of the team must always outweigh the interests of any individual, including me.
- I know what makes me good, and it's not a bat.
- I can't keep playing 10-11 months a year and keep being sharp after 15 years of international cricket.
- It's always been about the team; it's never been about myself.
- My personal goals have always and will always take a backseat to the team.
- I watch the ball, and I just play. I have always said that I don't feel there's a big difference between the three formats. It is just a mindset, applying yourself to the wicket and conditions, and that's always been the way that I have played.
- Even the thunderous master-blasters, like Andre Russell and MS Dhoni, men who now make scoring more than 20 runs per over look simple, often thrive on the right side of an incredibly slender gap between six and out. They are not more lucky than anyone else. They are more brilliant.
- Obviously I want to be there at the end every time, winning games for the team.
- The World Cup is a tough tournament.
- I accept that it is not always moonshine and roses, and you can't expect things must always go your way.

- I like to entertain the crowd. Personally I like to entertain my team-mates first, but when the crowd gets going, it is amazing.

- Captaining South Africa was definitely not one of my goals.
- I know Test cricket is more about endurance. T20 is more about innovating, creating, and the energy at the wicket.
- I don't care about hundreds, fifties, averages.
- I prefer to be out of the spotlight, to be honest. I've always been that kind of personality.
- I've made peace with the fact that the World Cup will not define me. Yes, it would be nice to add that to what's been a very enjoyable career, but I know it won't define me as a person or cricketer.
- In my heart, international cricket is the way forward. That's where you want to play; that's where the pressure really lies. That's where you make your name.

- You represent your country - that's the biggest honour ever. I had the privilege of doing that for more than 14 years.
- I believe I am strong mentally. My breaking points might be bigger than most players. I think it's because of the way I grew up with my two older brothers. They pushed my limits quite often - once every day, I think! I think that played a big role in my breaking point being bigger than most players. Not all players.

- I truly love captaining. I've grown into enjoying it.
- Winning an official World Cup with the South African team had become my burning ambition.
