- I've heard pro-lifers yell at abortion clinic workers that they should 'Repent!' Repent of what? They don't see what they are doing as something that needs to be repented of. Why? Because they are blinded. Do you think yelling at them will remove that blindness? Not likely.

- Time is money, and the more breaks given, the less money that is made.
