- When I was in a couple of movies in the '80s, I was winging it.

- 'Paul's Boutique' was a bust, right? That was a bummer. We didn't pause on it for a long time - we didn't go through therapy - but it was weird. And because it was a bust, we didn't go on tour.

- Take what you're good at and give to the cause that you care most about.

- Champagne Jerry records are definitely, in one way, on the very far end of the weird spectrum of rap music, then, in another way, very far on the weird punk spectrum.
- Our talent and skill as rappers is clearly the first thing you notice. I don't know what we were thinking. We just really love rap and wanted to be rappers. Is that weird?

- I'd like to be in an action movie.
- I love being in the Beastie Boys.
- We were from downtown, so we were rapping in Danceteria, in these white downtown clubs, really. Nobody downtown was rapping. Nobody we knew was rapping. So we were like, 'We should do it.' We weren't making fun of it; we loved it, and we wanted to be part of it.
- A lot of Jewish kids do identify with us.
- I want to open a restaurant.
- I know Noah Baumbach from a long time ago. We were hanging out one night, and he asked if I wanted to be in his movie. If somebody whose stuff you really like says, 'Hey, you want to do it with me?,' you got to do it. I would like to say that I get these offers all the time, but I don't.
- I head a Salt-n-Pepa song one time, where they named every rapper in New York. And they didn't name us!

- I was not thinking about getting into acting in any way.

- Of course, if you're gonna make a rap song, you're gonna want to sound like Melle Mel.
- I reject Donald Trump's mission of America.
- Since high school, I was in this band. And you know, it's one thing when you're in a band in high school, but then to have it last for so long - that's who I am and what I did forever.
- Mike is the craziest person. He's scattered; he's all over the place. When you hold him down and tell him, 'This is what you're doing,' he's fantastic. But you have to hold him down. Like, when he had to write his verse for 'Hello Nasty,' we had to take his phone away to get him to do it.
- There's songs you listen to at really heavy times, and you associate those songs with being depressed. 'English Rose' by The Jam, I can't listen to - it's just too heavy for me.

- Nobody wants to see the old person at the club.
- I don't really get a lot of stuff sent to me, but I do get things given to me in person. One of my favorites was from a kid in the mid-'90s. He gave us all a bunch of pants he made.
- It's been fun to just play bass in a band and play live but be in the background.
- I support women-run business.
- I grew up - my dad, every time I was with my dad, he was always - not always, but he wrote. He's a writer. So he was always in his office writing. He made a plan and, like, a point of, 'This is my work. I'm going to do this every day for these amount of hours.' So I think that's where I got, like, a work sort of ethic.
- I do dream. I mean, I must every night, right? But I only remember a couple a year.
- Some of the stuff that I say on 'License to Ill,' I say some real dumb stuff.

- My specialties include macaroni and cheese and ordering Chinese-food delivery.
- I trust anybody's memory more than I trust mine.

- Our music is weird. It's not pop. I don't know why so many people buy our records.
- Unfortunately, like, homework and school wasn't the thing that I was obsessing over. It was, you know, music and making music and how to like - and drum machines. And we met Rick Rubin, and Rick Rubin had a drum machine. So I would just cut school and go to his house - his dorm room.
- If any fantastic filmmakers want to offer me roles, I'll consider it!
- Rap is the only super-current music. If you're into reggae or dancehall, and you don't know Bob Marley, then you don't really know what you're listening to. But if you're listening to rap, and you're 15, you're like, 'Grandmaster Flash? Who's that? Public Enemy? Yeah, my dad told me about them once.' And that's just how it is.
- Part of me feels it's better we're not in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
- All generations think the present moment is the greatest but also have this fascination with before their time. I do the same thing. I see old British movies. I'm like, 'Man, I would love to be in London at that time.' But then I wouldn't be able to watch 'The Walking Dead,' I wouldn't have cable, and my pizza options would be limited.
- I wonder what it would have been like if I could actually sing.
- When I was a little kid, I wanted to be an actor.
- We did make fools of ourselves, but people were into it.
- You think about when you're with your friend, and you hang out with your friend. And then you go do whatever you're doing, your life. You know, and then you see your friend again. But for us, we were friends that, we would be together, and then we would go to work, which was us still again, so we were always together.
- 'Licensed to Ill' was like a cold, and we took so much vitamin C that we'd never get that cold again.
- I can literally walk around at our own shows, and nobody recognizes me.
- What I work hardest at is just trying to not let things get me crazy.
- You'd think that my acting in 'Lost Angels' would have been the reason why I gave up on it. But yeah, I'm just not that good at it. Auditioning is super weird, and I'm bad at it.
- 'The Squid and the Whale' was a really good movie.
