- In zombie horror, the juxtaposition of the calm world of the living and the menace of the undead inspires terror. In zombie comedy, like 'Pride and Prejudice and Zombies,' it is played for laughs.
- There is a lot of talk in conservative circles about judicial modesty and deferring to the political branches.
