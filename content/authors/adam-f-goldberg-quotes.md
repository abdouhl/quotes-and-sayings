- When you hire directors, you're most concerned about whether or not someone from the outside will get the jokes.
- There was kind of a no-nonsense parenting style that my parents had that was true of the time. Everything now... there are books, and there are websites, and there are blogs, and you're reading, and there's research. We're such an interconnected world now, and half the stuff they did was pretty terrible, but we somehow turned out fine.
- Convincing Robert Englund to come out of retirement to play Freddy Krueger one last time is a true bucket-list moment for me as a writer. I've been a longtime obsessive fan, collecting Freddy artwork and action figures.
- The way I'm raising my kids is so different than the way I was raised.
- Ever since 'The Goldbergs' began, one of my dreams was to write a homage to 'Highlander.'
- I think a lot of guys have their favorite shirt that they wear for years and years.
- My favorite thing to do as a kid was pretend I was in the opening credits of a sitcom. As the theme song would play, I'd look up at the imaginary camera and smile as my name would flash on the screen.
- I'm obsessed with musicals.
- I always say that even though my dad was alive during Woodstock, he was just not invited. He just seemed like he was from a different generation.
- First love is such a big thing growing up.
- Anything that I love, I love to the extreme. I'm obsessive. If it's 'Star Wars,' if it's 'Transformers,' if it's the Flyers, I geek out.
- My mom was always trying to figure out ways to make Hanukkah exciting and compete with our neighbors the Kremps, who always had these amazing blow-out Christmas parties.
- My mom was a shopaholic. She can literally never wear the same thing twice. That's fine with me.
- I remember running down the hallway screaming 'We're Not Gonna Take It.' It was really one of those childhood anthems that really stirred you up and made you want to rebel.
- In high school, I was so obsessed with the movie that I started an actual 'Highlander' club with my two best friends, Mike Levy and David Sirota. What began as a few geeks hitting each other with swords we made in woodshop soon became a school-wide game with 20 people playing. It became so disruptive that the administration had to shut it down.
- I'm terrible with titles.
- Prior to 'The Goldbergs,' I rarely got good reviews on anything I've done.
- Anyone who grew up with me knows that Queen is my favorite band of all time.
- For me, I went to NYU, and at that point, it was 1995, and everyone wanted to be Tarantino. I was writing these stupid comedies, and I felt lost.
- One of my favorite things was I got to work with Avi Arad on a movie for Sony, and we don't realize this, but he's the reason toys were sold off of cartoons, more or less. He created the Gobots!
- I never saw my parents kiss.
- I was definitely more of a movie/cartoon guy than comics, but I really do like graphic novels - I don't have the time to sit down and read Stephen King like I used to, so I find picking up 'Saga' every now and then and just diving back into it is a great way to stay reading.
- Do I think technology is bad? No. I think it's wonderful that the world is so connected now. But I think, as a result, childhood ends a little earlier.
- My brother was a huge Tim Kerr fan. He loved the way Kerr would power to the net, and he related to that playing style.
- All of my family members have had moments where they're upset with me because I'll cavalierly write a story just to be funny.
- It's very complicated to literally put your family on TV.
- My brother Barry was into all sports, and so was my late father. For me, hockey was the one sport I loved and played. I didn't really pay much attention to the other sports.
- That's what I did whenever I loved a movie: I'd get together with my friends and play it out and re-enact it.
- Some of my movies hold the bottom rankings on Rotten Tomatoes.
- I love 'AP Bio' - I think it's so funny - it's just not the show I want to do.
- On TV, teachers are comedically jaded. That's not how I saw them.
- That's what happens when they give guys like me a television show: you try and get toys and Garbage Pail Kids!
- I followed Evan's career through the '90s and went to many Lemonheads concerts in N.Y.C. Since he was my best friend's family, he always felt like my family in a weird way.
- In our house, there was a lot of yelling. It was everyone walking in on each other and very few boundaries.
- Queen is my all-time favorite band in history. I was an obsessive growing up after I discovered them at 10 at summer camp.
- My rap name as a kid was Big Tasty.
- I am a Gobot junkie, and I pitched the Gobots movie as an animated movie a few years ago, and we're trying to work something out now that the rights are cleared. But that's my dream project, besides 'The Goldbergs' - doing a Gobots movie.
- I had 'Breaking In' at Fox, and that was a constant stopping and starting of getting canceled and picked up again.
- I never did video dating.
- My dad felt old school.
- That's what Flyers fans are all about. My favorite thing about Philly fans is booing their own team.
- I would make hockey movies: I would edit together Flyers games and do highlight reels of goals or fights, which I still have to this day.
- When I was at the end of middle school and the beginning of high school, I fell in love with hockey in a serious way.
- 'Afterlife With Archie' - they're doing a great job.
- Singing karaoke is my worst nightmare. But in the car, I rock out to anything Bon Jovi or Beastie Boys.
- 'Breaking In' is a very different office comedy and a caper comedy. Aside from 'Chuck,' there is no half-hour comedy that does stuff like that.
- My mom was always writing me notes to get me out of stuff.
- As a family, we all loved the Flyers. To me, rooting for the Flyers were how I bonded with my dad especially.
- I have many of the Rock Lords; Magmar, I'm obsessed with. That's a sign of how versatile the Rock Lords were, that they could come out with toys that turned into rocks.
- Everyone in the '80s grew up, and for a lot of the film executives, that's what they know and love.
- If you Google a list and just see all the movies that came out in 1984, they're classics, and they define that decade.
- For me, 'The Goldbergs' was about surviving a crazy family - and believe me, the show is a sanitized version!
- I always wanted to meet David Hasselhoff, but I never did.
- I've never made a show that goes right on the air and is perfect. People don't remember, but the original 'Goldbergs' pilot was poorly received, and I had to retool that for ABC, where it eventually became a hit.
- If I don't call my mom back, she'll go on Twitter and say, 'Adam hasn't called me. I'm worried about him,' and strangers will say, 'You're horrible. You go call your mom right now!' It's very complicated.
- My dad would always get into fights over parking spaces. He would do this all the time.
- When I was nine, I got my head stuck in a bucket trying to be Darth Vader.
- I've been with my wife since I was 16.
- My middle school years were defined by memorizing every single word off 'License to Ill' and 'Paul's Boutique.'
- I'm one of those writers that have always worked on multiple things.
- I was so obsessed with 'The Princess Bride.' I loved it so much that I even have a re-enactment I did of a radio play of the iocane powder scene.
- Negative attention was better than no attention.
- My mom is not typical in any way.
- I wasn't a sweet kid. I was an instigator and provoked everyone with my goofy hyena cackle, loving every minute of the drama I could create.
- 'The Wonder Years' family was the kind where everything seemed to be bubbling and simmering with the occasional explosion. There were a lot of things that went unsaid in that family. In my family, everything is said - on the surface, you scream and yell about it, and three minutes later, you're all friends.
- Because my home life was nuts, I didn't look to my parents for help. I looked to my teachers. They made me who I am. They took on a parental role. They're like celebrities or heroes to me.
- For me, every show that's about teachers - and there's been a number of them - they're like misfits who hate the kids and don't want to be there and hate their jobs. For me, having crazy parents, my teachers were the sane people who raised me, and they liked being there.
- I think the '80s works for a TV show because it's the last time the world was simple. It was before the Internet really changed everything and made the world really small.
- If I called my kids a moron, I think it would traumatize them. I don't think they even know what the word is.
- I like being surrounded by all the stuff that makes me feel creative and inspires me.
- I'm envious of 'Glee' - artists turned their libraries over for free because they knew it would lead to album sales.
- Jeff Garlin is essentially my dad.
- I grew up obsessively collecting Queen T-shirts and concert posters and rare U.K. imports of their CDs.
- I was in college starting in '95, and 'Rent' was the only show I could see - because if you waited in line and camped out, you could try to get the lottery tickets.
- My mom is a pack rat.
- My parents are interested in politics.
- I feel like, with any show, the creator should stick to it the first few years and get it off the ground.
- Being from Philadelphia, 'Parents Just Don't Understand' was a big deal - I have audio of my brother and me singing that song.
- Copyright law is too confusing.
- The only interaction I had with my brothers is like negative attention where I'd basically egg them on into beating me up - which was delightful! Otherwise, it was me with a video camera jumping on a bed pretending to be the Ultimate Warrior or setting up my robots making a Transformers movie because I was a lonely kid.
- Watching Eagles games with my dad, whether at the vet or in our house, was a big part of my childhood.
- I ended up going to NYU for film school - close to Pennsylvania - but we talked about what if I went to UCLA or USC, and my mom's whole world was caving in.
