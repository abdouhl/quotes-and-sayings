- I've always used songs and music and songwriting as a way to sort of let feelings go.
- My perspective on life in general has definitely changed. Having a child did that for sure.
- Nobody's perfect, everybody is flawed in a way, and to recognize your own flaws and to just enjoy them is something that I try to do for myself. I do that all the time.
- I wrote a song on the record called 'Flawed Design' and it's basically looking at that, and it was just exploring how everybody obviously has flaws. I think to embrace those flaws - enjoy them, embrace them - and actually be a real person is something that a lot of people struggle with, myself included.
- I was very shocked to hear about Michael Jackson's passing. He was a pioneer, and icon and a legend. I remember buying 'Thriller' when I was pretty young.
- I can say that on the record 'Transit of Venus,' there's maybe one or two songs that actually do come from my heart, but a lot of songs have been written just for radio and for fans, you know, to relate to.
- I was really proud of the Three Days Grace record 'One-X.'
- Flawed Design' is a song on the record and it explores why people feel a need to present themselves maybe not necessarily as what they actually are. It seems like in society, a lot of people want to be or try to be perfect.
- The band 'The Tragically Hip'. They're super well known in Canada, not so much in the U.S. They're a great band and when we were growing up we listened to them all the time, They're icons in Canada.
- I've always written about stuff I have gone through.
