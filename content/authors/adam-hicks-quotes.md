- I spend a lot of time on my music.
- I am definitely going to college!
- My parents are my major supporters. I look up to Denzel Washington, Jack Nicholson and Jim Carrey. They have all opened my mind and helped me with my craft.
- I've been writing music since 4th grade, and I love putting words together and expressing things in a way that you can move your head to and you can really relate to, because I have a lot to say.
- If someone is sad, they put on a song, or if someone wants to rock out, and they want to get into a good mood, they put on music. Just being able to be a part of something like that I feel like was my ultimate push to do music.
- I live in Las Vegas with my family, and I never realized what my parents would go through to get me to a five-minute audition.
- The greatest thing about music is everyone has their own style, and I respect all styles of music.
- We don't have performances as big as 'Lemonade Mouth' on 'Zeke and Luther,' but they're both amazing experiences; just, 'Lemonade Mouth' was a bit bigger. It was different for me.
- The cast of 'Lemonade Mouth' was picked so perfectly. A lot of people see us as a band on camera, but not a lot of people know that Lemonade Mouth was a band off-camera, too.
- I love all kinds of music. My dad's from London, so he loves David Bowie, the Stones, The Clash. I grew up with that influence while loving poetry and loving all kinds of current music.
- I'm a mad thinker in general. I think about everything, all the time. Especially when I write music, a lot of the influences come from personal experiences or from being on the outside looking in, being that person who witnessed things that stuck with me throughout my life.
