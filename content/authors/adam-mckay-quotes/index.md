- For my money, I don't think there's been a better comedy than 'Kung Fu Hustle' in a lot of years. That movie just knocked me over.

- I love 'The Wire;' that's my favorite show, so I'll watch that.

- Michael Lewis has the amazing ability to take complex formulas and concepts and turn them into page-turners.
- It's Will Ferrell, he does Will Ferrell movies. But if you really look at it, he tries to do something different with each one, whether it's an action cop movie like 'The Other Guys' or doing 'Talladega Nights' going into red state America or 'Casa de Mi Padre' or 'Stranger Than Fiction,' which is more of a drama.
- I'll tell you one thing... no doubt about it, my favorite kind of comedy is talking head comedy. I mean, if it were up to me, I'd do a whole entire movie that was just around a dinner table.

- There's nothing more fun to me than new characters and a new world.
- I always thought George Bush was more oblivious than mean, but oblivious can quickly go to mean.
- Every time a pundit or elected official is on any TV news program, it should be a polite formality to mention that GE has made such and such billions off the war in Iraq by selling arms or that Murdoch is a right-wing activist with a clear stake in who wins and who taxes his profits the least.

- Bush already gave obscene tax breaks to people like me and Warren Buffet, and we are saying it's not fair.

- There are many aspects to directing that have a romantic place in people's minds.
- You have a guy like Bernie Madoff literally steal $80 billion, you know, AIG steal hundreds of billions, Goldman Sachs. Crime has changed so much, and to really do a movie with, like, drug dealers or drug smugglers is kind of almost quaint at this point.

- There's nothing more fun than mean-spirited characters.
- I always say the classier cousin of 'Anchorman' is 'Mad Men,' because when you really look at it, why do people really love Don Draper in 'Mad Men?' He's just a terrible guy. But we know why he's terrible, and I think that's really key to why you can be sympathetic to a character.
- You have to be able to fail with the improv. You have to not care.

- Pete Wilson deregulated energy as a pay out to Enron, and we blamed Gray Davis.
- I hired Tina Fey for 'SNL,' which was certainly a good match. She took off right away there.
- I have no political ax to grind; I just find it absurd that huge billion-dollar corporations can take over elections. I just find it insane that, for instance, we give tax breaks to people like myself making millions of dollars, while there're no tax breaks for working people. That, to me, is not a political issue, that's a life issue.
- It should be a law for one whole year that all laugh tracks are Seth Rogen. The world would get ever so slightly better.

- I was a huge fan of comedy in high school.

- We lost our minds in the '80s and '90s; we really as a society just felt that everyone could only care about themselves. There was no responsibility to discuss what's going on in your town, your state, your nation. And it was a blast, it was really fun, but it doesn't work.

- 'Blazing Saddles' is one of the funniest movies ever made.
- I love action movies.

This was the definition in Webster's up until 1987 when a corporation bought Webster's and changed it to exclude any mention of corporations.

- I actually opened for Chris Rock at the Funny Bone one time.
- We, Will Ferrell and I, were approached by Sequoia, which is a big financing firm up in Palo Alto; they do a lot of Internet stuff, and they came to us and said they had an idea for a comedy site, and Will and I were sorta like, 'Yeah, we don't know. It's the Internet, we've seen it come and go.'
- The 'Police Academy' stuff was all hyper-slapsticky.

- The idea of 24-hour news, if you really step back, is pretty insane. Just even saying '24-hour news' almost has satire laced in it.

- The way you really stop Al-Qaeda is by stopping their funding. It's not by carpet-bombing or land invasions or anything.
- 'Step Brothers 2' would have been fun, there's no doubt about it. Maybe someday. Does that idea age? I don't know. It all depends on how the movie ages.
- When I was at 'SNL,' I would constantly get in arguments, 'Why aren't we more political? We're not going after Bush.' Then look what happened - that Sarah Palin season, they were on fire. It was about something.
- I think when a lot of actors hear improv, they think of throwing a line in or doing a slightly different take.
- Depending on what state you live in, you may only have right-wing talk radio and FOX or CBN with MSNBC three hundred channels down the dial.
- If you go back and watch 'The French Connection,' it's been cannibalized so many times. There are certain movies like that, where you see the original and think, 'This isn't so great.' And the reason it isn't so great is because everyone has copied it.
- America is a country that prides itself on being able to identify a 'straight shooter' or 'the genuine article' when it comes to our leaders. As a nation, we can 'feel it in our gut' when someone is giving us a bum steer.
- Voting for Romney after the train wreck of that was the eight years of W. Bush is like losing your pay check playing a rigged game of three-card monte and then playing the same game again a week later 'cause the cards are a different color.
- Any time Chris Nolan wants to call me for advice, he can.
- I don't want to speak for my movies; you could say my movies are just completely silly and dumb, but in the case of 'Idiocracy' and 'Borat,' without a doubt there is a really subversive and sophisticated assault on American culture.
- Word of mouth and the Internet are the only press we have left.
- I'm a huge hip hop fan going way back, like, back to '83. I had my Gemini mixer listening to Run-DMC and Kurtis Blow.
- Billions have been spent for one purpose and one purpose only: to obscure and distract from the fact that Mitt Romney is backing the identical agenda George W. Bush did.
- I was shocked when 'The Hobbit' ended where it ended. I wasn't paying attention to what they were doing; I didn't know they had another movie, and I couldn't believe it was when the dragon came out.
- First off, no one award-wise ever rewards comedy, which is... whatever. I don't care about that.
- When you do comedy, you get impervious to good and bad reviews.

- I love Paul Rudd.
- A dry stretch of commentary in the middle of an 'Anchorman' movie would have been a terrible thing.
- My theme song is 'One Tin Soldier' by Coven.
- 'The Real World' is the most predictable arc ever. They get on the show, they're all excited, we're gonna be best friends, then people start drinking and get hammered, and say stupid stuff, and that's pretty much it.
