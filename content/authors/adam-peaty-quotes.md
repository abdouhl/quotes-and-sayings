- I love the Royal Family and every aspect of Britain and what we have achieved in history.
- I went 59.9 sec. when I was 18 and thought, 'Hmm, that was fast - let's see how much faster we can go and what the rest of the world can do to keep up.'

- Training is my drug. I'm going to be the best I can in and out of the water - train right, eat right - and that is the way it should be.
- What's the worst that could happen? You're going to come second or lose? It's not like someone has got a gun to your head.

- In sport, a massive amount is to do with genetics.

- I've been going to the same barber the last few years, and we have great chats whenever I'm in the chair. He'll ask: 'How you doing? How's the training going?' Just ordinary, obvious things, but then, like you do with your barber, you start talking about personal stuff.
