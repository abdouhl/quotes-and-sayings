- A common sense of humour and a love of music is really important, as I love all types of music. You name me any genre, and I can give you a list of artists I adore.
- I'm most comfortable in my bare shorts without any underwear and a T-shirt if I'm home. I definitely like to sleep naked. I don't know how girls do it with thongs. Forget that!
- Fortunately I'm Latin, and I'm born with a little bit of rhythm by default. It's in the DNA. I have that going for me, but I've never been considered one of the world's greatest dancers.
- I give everyone upmost respect, and when people feel that, you end up getting the most out of your interaction with them. That connectivity is really important in my life.
- I think I'm a trivia nerd. I love to learn about everything. I'm curious.
- I'm definitely not comfortable in a Speedo! That's as uncomfortable as it gets!
- I actually didn't really go to college. I enrolled and never showed up. Being on a college campus where we shot some of the scenes in 'The Goodwin Games'... it did make me wish that was an experience that I had.
- Math just wasn't my favorite. I didn't get how important math is and how it relates to real life. That's why I think I was turned off to it. Once I got down arithmetic and a little bit of algebra, I think I checked out. As I've gotten older, I think there's a lot more relation to math. English was my favorite subject.
- It was funny to run into girls I knew after the movie came out because they would say, 'I saw you on 'Magic Mike,' but there was this look of embarrassment. It was very cute.
- I do think about having babies a lot, actually. I think I look forward to that more than anything else.
