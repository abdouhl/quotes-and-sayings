- I watch college basketball and sports in general. I'm also a runner. I live on the Upper West Side of Manhattan near Central Park, so I try to squeeze in runs through Central Park when I can.
- Basketball is so unique. It's both a team and an individual sport.
- I ran track. I ran cross country. But I did not play organized basketball in high school, at least on our team. But I played a lot of sports.
- Technology is changing the world; it's changing our sport. It's changing the way people are following the NBA.
- Strong college basketball is great for the NBA.
- Ultimately, the issue is not whether you are pro- or anti-sports betting. You begin, from my standpoint, from the premise that it is going to continue to exist, and if it is going to continue to exist, should it be shoved underground, or should it be regulated?
- While, to me, daily fantasy is in no way sports betting, it's certainly a cousin of sports betting in that it attracts many of the same type of people who would otherwise choose to bet on sports.
- I'm not coming in as an advocate of sports gambling. I'm trying to be more of a realist to say it's going on in a massive way... and I think the right course would be therefore to legalize it and regulate it.
- I would say I was into two sports as a kid: basketball and baseball.
- I tend to be a pretty physical person.
- I love technology. I have my iPad, iPad mini, iPhone and Mac laptop. Because I love technology, I think if I were not at the NBA, I would try to be part of a tech startup company.
- I'm a huge fan of the game. It's beyond a fringe benefit of obviously getting to work at the league office. I watch a ton of games in person, on television, on all forms of new media I follow the league. And so it's just beyond my wildest imaginations to me to now be the commissioner of the NBA.
