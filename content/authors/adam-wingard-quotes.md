- To me, the thing about anime is that it's so adult-oriented. I remember going to Suncoast growing up, and you see 'Akira' there with the little 'Not for Kids' sticker on it. That always made an impact on me.
- This house I grew up in was built in the 1800s, and the back yard was like a cemetery. Naturally, I grew up in an environment where ghosts and supernatural things were very unnerving to me, because my brothers and I dealt with it on a daily basis.
- I think, as a filmmaker, it's important to be honest with yourself at all times in terms of what's working and what's not.
- 'Cloverfield' and 'REC' are great examples of movies that took kind of tired genres, the monster movie and the zombie film, and by filming them in found footage, it was a new perspective. It gives you a whole new take and helps you re-experience that all over again.
- I like the idea of a character that you wanna like even though you know he's making immoral choices throughout the film.
- I love so-called movies that are bad movies, but 'Prometheus' is one of those movies that people are gonna come back around on in 20 years. There's gonna be midnight screenings of that thing.
- You can be precious about something like 'Blair Witch' and say, 'How dare you approach it as a sequel or remake' or whatever, but its legacy was so tarnished by 'Book of Shadows' that someone had to come in and do something in the spirit of the original.
- I love going on IMDb message boards, and there are some hilarious things that go on there - the most negative people on the planet.
- I think the hardest part about making a scary film is about being able to retain the mystery, especially when it comes to supernatural stuff.
- A lot of people ask me, 'Are you going to do a sequel to 'The Guest' or 'You're Next?' - those movies weren't financially viable, so even though there are a lot of fans of it, it'd be a pretty small market we'd be appealing to. It's got to be a big hit for you to really justify that.
- If we're going to be considered horror filmmakers, we have to prove it not only to ourselves but to the audience that we can actually make something scary.
- I hate it when you are watching a movie where the characters are on the news, and for some reason they shoot it with a 35mm camera or a 4K camera, and they just put it on the TV as if that's the way it would look - it always takes me out of it by putting a filter on certain things. If it's too high quality, you're never gonna buy it.
- The whole Bond thing has gotten so dour with the direction they've been going in, it feels like they need to move back to Pierce Brosnan-style fun Bond again. If they did that, Dan Stevens would be the perfect choice.
- 'Drive' is definitely an inspiration because it was a film that was able to use what would normally be considered cheesy, kind of bold, electronic music choice and pull it off in a mainstream way.
- What's really scary about the original 'Blair Witch' is that it doesn't really answer any questions, so what makes that ending so scary is you walk out feeling dirty because you don't even know what happened. It feels wrong.
