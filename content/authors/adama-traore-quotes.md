- People tell me I'm the first in dribbling. But it's important that, after dribbling, I cross or pass or score. If I don't, then dribbling is pointless.
- I played my first game of football when I was 3 1/2 years old.
- I was born in Spain, I know the culture there, and lived most of my life there, but I have Malian origins too. For me it's a beautiful thing that I can have both. I can be in both countries, speak the language, blend in in two cultures.
- The most important thing for me was talking to players like Xavi, Andres Iniesta and Javier Mascherano - they would tell me about the life away from football. All I wanted to do was play football but they explained how important everything is away, how you prepare and live your life.

- It was difficult at Villa because they'd struggled for two years and I'd come mainly from Barcelona B in the second division in Spain. I needed time to adapt but Tim Sherwood and Remi Garde had to win games; they didn't have time to think about little things about my game. It was a bad moment, it was such a hard, sad experience.
- I joined Aston Villa to improve myself in the Premier League. It started well but then I got injured and Villa ended up having five managers that season.

- When I came to Aston Villa, they had struggled for two years before then.
- Barcelona is the best education possible. Training with Messi is something I will never forget - he was always the last off the pitch and working incredibly hard in the gym. If he is the best player in the world and works so hard, who are we? You can have all the crazy talent but you need to work.
- With the ball I can run 37kmh but I've never been timed without it because my job is to play football. I'm not an athlete.

- Maybe there is no player who is faster than me in the world.
- Darren Campbell, the British Olympic sprinter, was my sprint coach at Middlesbrough - yet the best advice he gave me was to slow down.
