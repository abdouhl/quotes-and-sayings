- I remember vividly one distinct memory of arriving in Hong Kong and being the only blonde haired girl in this sea of international students, and thinking, 'Oh, my God. There's no hiding here.'
- Although my father is English, I was brought up in Australia.
- In a photo shoot, you have to be very comfortable in your own skin. It's all about confidence-boosting and putting on armor.
- I live in L.A. and I do have wonderful friends; I moved there when I was 19 so I developed a close knit group of friends, none of whom are actors, none of which are Australian, but I couldn't do it long term.
- I never consciously set out to be an actor. I just kind of did whatever acting I could do.
- Generally, I play the kind of ethereal, fragile-on-the-outside-but-hard-and-damaged-on-the-inside type.
- I really like being thrown into the works. Many actors, I have found, have this as a common trait. We had to, as children, adapt to various situations with either a military family or things like that.
- I love new cities, and if I haven't travelled for a month, the need to go somewhere starts to gets under my skin.
