- When I work, I'm thinking in terms of purely visual effects and relations, and any verbal equivalent is something that comes afterwards. But it's inconceivable to me that I could experience things and not have them enter into my painting.
- I want to express the utmost intensity of the color, bring out the quality, make it expressive.
- I never use nature as a starting point. I never abstract from nature; I never consciously think of nature when I paint.
- I use color in terms of emotional quality, as a vehicle for feeling... feeling is everything I have experienced or thought.
