- I don't like writing essays or theory.
- There have always been poets who performed. Blake sang his Songs of Innocence and Experience to parties of friends.
- Most people ignore most poetry because most poetry ignores most people.
- Stadium rock and commercial rock are the opposite of what poetry needs. An audience of around 200 is ideal for poetry.
- I use the language I use to my friends. They wouldn't believe me if I used some high-flown literary language. I want them to believe me.
- I use rock and jazz and blues rhythms because I love that music. I hope my poetry has a relationship with good-time rock'n roll.
- I want to speak, to sing to total strangers. It's my way of talking to the world.
- Written poetry is different. Best thing is to see it in performance first, then read it. Performance is more provocative.
