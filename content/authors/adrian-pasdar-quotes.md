- I started to run marathons and got into road biking in Los Angeles. It was a lot of fun and I managed to get into the shape of my life.
- When you're in love, you'll believe anything.
- I just kind of stumbled into this Marvel thing with 'Spider-Man.' It's been great. I love it, it keeps me in town, it keeps me busy, and it's a lot of fun.
- I don't think 'Profit' is devoid of morality. He's just on a different plane than the rest of us.
- I have a channel on YouTube called Buckshotwon. It started off as a kind of joke, just behind-the-scenes goofs.
- It's always very fun to play someone who's somewhat enigmatic, but at the same time there are underpinnings of real concern for mankind. That was what 'Profit' had a lot of.
- I did a show called 'Profit' a while back, and I based some of the work on some people that were in office at the time.
- That's what frees up an actor: when you don't have to be responsible to likability.
- 'Profit' was an intriguing fellow that couldn't be approached as a villain or a hero. The challenge in hanging a show on a character like Jim Profit was that we knew that we were in for a rough reception.
- It's a very different feeling to work on a show with a future.
- I've never been good at selling myself.
- It's not stupid TV, it's not a reality program. It actually is complex. There's many layers to 'Heroes.'
- I never grew up with heroes in show business. My hero was my father.
- Austin is home in a lot of ways. Both my kids were born here, and my wife's side of the family lives here.
- My favorite was the Silver Surfer growing up. I just thought that his slug line, 'He who travels fastest, always travels alone,' always appealed to me as a kid.

- Every show needs a jerk. I guess I'm that guy.
- I didn't have the opportunity to finish college and I was quite sad about that.
- It's fun when you have a whole team of writers that really like writing for someone; you always end up with some really great lines.
- My life has taken on a different course. I've got a responsibility now not just as a husband but as a father.
- Well, every superhero has to have a super look, right?
- You'd think they could spit out shows better than 'Champs' and 'High Incident' with the pool of talent involved, unless they're just throwing money at people to create shows and they're not really behind them. I mean, the best thing they can do is 'Champs,' a half-hour comedy about men being stupid? People can just look around and see that.
- A lot of directors understand everything but the story.
- We all have great faith in the writing team that puts together 'Heroes.'
- I got to meet Princess Diana at Leicester Square, where we had a big premiere. It was one of the great experiences in my life.
- I haven't ever been stereotyped or pigeonholed or put into a box.
- One of the things I'm most proud of is actually saying I'm going to do something and doing it.
- I wasn't a good kid. I didn't hurt anybody, but I was doing things kids do that they shouldn't.
- I think network TV to a large extent has underestimated the intelligence of the American public for so many years now. It's tried to appeal to the lowest common denominator. I think the average viewer is much more intelligent than that and crave a little more complexity and are willing to pay more attention.
- I thought I was signed up to be on 'Heroes.' It turns out I signed up to be on 'Survivor.'
- Nathan Fillion is one of the greatest men that's ever walked the earth, as far as I'm concerned.
- I remember being scared to death of horror movies as a kid. Sometimes, I missed the whole movie because I was so scared and couldn't look.
- The best TV is always about family, whether it's 'All in the Family,' or 'The Sopranos' or 'The Flintstones.'
- Every film I've done, I've tried to pick ones where I can learn.
- A lot of the dysfunction that exists underneath the surface of a lot of big business corporations is really profound.
- Acting just seems to be a way of getting into a different place. It seems like a really creative place to be.
- I wasn't really a big comic book guy, growing up.
- Everyone has a voice, and I don't think mine is that different.
- What you would call a 'lead,' I've always considered a supporting part, and what people would call 'supporting parts,' I've considered leads. In a way, I look at it in reverse, because supporting parts - when they're done correctly - are the ones that are progenitors for storylines, to move forward.
- We don't work for the government. We don't carry guns. We don't chase aliens. We are a man and a woman. The similarities end there... If 'X-Files' and 'Touched by an Angel' crashed on 'Highway to Heaven,' you'd have 'Mysterious Ways.'
- I think the actor has two responsibilities. One is to be visually compelling, and the other to recite the lines as written by the writers.
- Do I believe in vampires? I've got an agent. Even more, I've got a manager. So yes, I believe full well in vampires and blood-letting.
- Most actors who direct do it because they've been directed by so many bad directors.
- Part of the reason a hit show is a hit show is because of the people - good, solid, decent people.
- I spend more time in suits than anyone in the corporate world.
- Being asked to carry a major show with the restrictions that are thrown on you is very limiting. I'd rather hit it hard, do it right, and walk away.
- You just go out there and do the best you can. If it hits, it hits. And if it doesn't, you go on to the next thing.
- I had so many people care so much and work so diligently to make sure I didn't end up in the wrong place.
- The different arenas that I've been able to do Iron Man in are fun, but some more than others. The anime that we did early on was tough. That was the hardest one. It was a reinterpretation of a reinterpretation. I don't think I'd do that again.
- I'm used to working with a rehearsal process and your body. It's a different thing to just be a voice. It's liberating, on one hand, because you get to show up in sweatpants and with Doritos on your fingers, but on the other hand, it's limiting because it's just your voice.
- Television is a business and, financially speaking, they have decisions and considerations that go far beyond the creative merit of the show. But at the same time, you'd like to believe in a man's word. When he shakes your hand and says he's going to stay with it, and doesn't, it's really frustrating in a way.
- I don't consider myself to be a celebrity. If anything I'm a minor celebrity or a TV star or whatever.
- Watching 'Profit' is like peering into a fishbowl and watching a piranha at work.
- I love dogs.
- There's probably somebody out there who has been dying to be Tony Stark, their whole life, and it will never happen. And then, it comes to me because I happened to do 'Heroes.' I mean, I love it. I'm totally respectful of the position, but I wasn't pursuing it.
- Television doesn't get any better than the second episode of 'Castle.'
- I learned this through Iron Man - it really doesn't matter what I think about who he is because everybody has such a huge idea about what they think the guy is. You can't just rely on your instincts and your imagination, you have to match up with what the expectations are from the people.
- I've always felt like I had a guardian angel.
- I just don't get out as much as people think I do.
- It's much juicier to play somebody a little more evil than Dudley Do-Right.
- There's so much showmanship and gamesmanship involved in politics, it's really not a stretch to imagine an actor getting involved in being a figurehead for a political party. But for myself personally, I just don't think I could do that.
- 'Profit' in my mind is as good as television gets, and if that didn't make it, all bets are off on really predicting what's going to work and what's not.
- I really enjoy those characters like 'Profit.' With those elements that are shady and dark, you're not responsible for being a likable character. Like some of Jack Nicholson's characters, you remember them for so long.
