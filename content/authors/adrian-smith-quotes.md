- The room is the most important thing about recording.
- I've never been much for theory and scales.
- We are one of the last heavy metal bands. Iron Maiden has always been unique.
- We try and stay out of the corporate side of it. The band has never compromised. At some point in our career we could have made a certain type of record and sold millions of units, as they are called.
- To me, anyone with an Australian accent wielding a tennis racket is cool.
- The band has always stayed close to its fans and not sold out. That's a very rare thing. I can see how rare that is having been outside of the band for eight years. Maiden has integrity. I think people appreciate that.
- When you're used to seeing someone being coldly efficient on court and suddenly they go on stage and into your world - it's fascinating.
- A band is sort of like a star. It reaches a peak and burns out. To have five guys working in perfect harmony longer than a couple years is difficult.
- I get to fish a lot of wild and wonderful places on tour.
