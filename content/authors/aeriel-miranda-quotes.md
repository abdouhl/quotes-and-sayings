- For me, as an actor, going from TV to film was interesting because TV and film are two very different things.
- I actually prefer film to TV, but I don't know why. I think there's just a different energy.
- 'Pretty Little Liars,' you know, it's a teen show that grew to be something bigger. I think you had girls from ages 7 to, like, 20 watching the show, and that was the predominant audience. Then it grew to be for girls, boys, men, women, people who are 7 to 35. I think that's crazy.
