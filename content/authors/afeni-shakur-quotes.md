- First of all, a lot of people, a lot of women and men, have lost their children. I'm not the only one.

Otherwise he would've had no way to get his feelings out.

- That's just the way life is. We have to be willing to pay the price. You have to be willing to pay the price for what's right - and for what we do wrong. That's one of the things that I love about my son. My son was always willing to take his weight.

When he was alive, people competed. There was a lot of competition, and a lot of the artists were better for it.
