- I don't want to become a serious, annoying sociologist. I try to regard sociology as a part of everyday life.
- I didn't have a career; I made films. It's very different.
- Like everybody, I wanted to meet Andy Warhol. I was impressed by his work and how daring he was. I think he changed the cinema completely, simply by opening his camera and letting it go.
- When I was younger, people were inventing a new way of writing - James Joyce, Hemingway, Faulkner. And I thought we had to find a structure for cinema. I fought for a radical cinema, and I continued all my life.
- I am a woman. I think I have the spirit, the intelligence, and - dare I say - the soul of a woman.
- I'm curious. Period. I find everything interesting. Real life. Fake life. Objects. Flowers. Cats. But mostly people. If you keep your eyes open and your mind open, everything can be interesting.
- I'm not interested in seeing a film just made by a woman - not unless she is looking for new images.
- My parents named me Arlette, and I changed it to Agnes when I was young. I didn't like it because I don't like names with 'ette' - you know, it looks like a little girl's name.
- I saw 'Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs' when it came out, didn't like it too much. I found she was stupid.
- Aging for me is not a condition but a subject.
- My mind is often half-sleeping, like in a daydream.
- When artists die early, they become idols even more.
- I wasn't attracted to American cinema, but I fell in love with Los Angeles the minute I arrived.
- Aging is interesting, you know? I really love it.
- My father was Greek, but he turned French during the war, and my mother was French. So I'm French, but I have Greek blood.
- I am small. I was always small. But only physically.
- I think I was a feminist before being born. I had a feminist chromosome somewhere.
- I didn't see myself as a woman doing film but as a radical film-maker who was a woman.
- I was not raised with films. And when Alain Resnais did the editing on my first film, he said, 'You should go to the Cinematheque.' I didn't even know we had one in Paris.
- Maybe something that amuses the Americans is that they are so worried about age, and I'm not at all.
- I make documentaries from time to time to remind myself of reality. It's like musicians doing scales to keep their fingers working: when you're in the street, listening to people, you're forced to be in the service of your subject.
- I had flops, I had success.
- When I love somebody, I cannot drop it out of my life. Love is not something like you open and you close, you know?
- I enjoy the time passing. I think it's a privilege to be in friendship with time.
- Hands are the tool of the painter, the artist.
- I wore black until I was twenty-five, like many young people. Everybody did. It was crazy! But now, getting older, I think color does me good.
- Sometimes I do things that are not really the right way because I'm daring, in a way.
- I've always loved polka dots. Ah, oui. It is a joyful shape, the polka dot. It is alive.
