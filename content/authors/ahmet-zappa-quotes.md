- I definitely have managed to overcome dyslexia now to become a fully functional human being but things were a lot more difficult when I was younger.
- I picked books by their covers - the worse the cover, the more I wanted to read it.

- My father would often work all night and sleep during the day, so for us, dinner might be pancakes, and breakfast might be beef stroganoff.
- I would ask my parents something, but then go to my siblings. We were encouraged to bounce ideas off everyone.
- My parents told us how they felt but never imposed their beliefs on us, although I appreciate I got a healthy sense of democracy from them.
- I miss my Dad. My Dad loved cheesy monster movies, so we'd have Godzilla movie marathons. Those are some of my favorite memories, laughing at how the monster outfits were so bad, like black garbage bags for heads.
- The way this whole novel thing came together was, I sold them one bill of goods and then didn't communicate very well. I am like Captain Run-on Sentence.
- I didn't read at all until I was 12. I just couldn't. It was too frustrating.
- At 12 I dropped out of school but I had lost interest in it at a much earlier age. For me, school was very very stressful.
