- I will always be a New York girl at heart, but I am really liking the L.A. lifestyle.
- One of these days in the next 10 years, I will play 'Evita.' I don't know when or where, but I love 'Evita', especially with all my Latin and Spanish studies. It's a very demanding role but I'd love to play it.
- Just to be working again as an actress and possibly doing TV would just be great. It's not about how big the role is.
- Sometimes in life, things just fall in to my lap. I'm very blessed that way.
- It took me years to actually get comfortable on the stage. I prefer the intimacy of screen; it comes easier to me. In theater, you have to be louder and bigger - that was harder for many years in my teens. But now I've conquered that. I eat up the stage. I love it.
