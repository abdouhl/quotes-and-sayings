- By virtue of my job, I'm traveling. You get to spend very little time with your family. We hardly get to meet each other except on the one odd day we really get to spend time, have dinner together. And that's rare, and we cherish it.
- Despite being in showbiz, I have a very real approach to my life. It plays off with my social life.
- I was studying to be an architect, I wasn't plotting to join the movies. Films were just another career option. I took acting up with the same schoolgirl enthusiasm I had for examinations. Acting is a job and I take it very seriously.
- For me, it's not about breaking big in Hollywood, but having interesting experiences.
- Aishwarya, my parent's daughter, has been brought up with enough values inculcated where I will use my discretion in my choices. At the same time, I recognize I am an actor, I am an artist, and if I feel the need to be liberated and do the kind of work I need to do, I will.
- I have always been a person who is extremely comfortable in my skin. I have always just been myself in all these years on the public platform.
- Even in India the Hindi film industry might be the best known but there are movies made in other regional languages in India, be it Tamil or Bengali. Those experiences too are different from the ones in Bombay.
- Comedy is difficult for an actor. But I think I have a good sense of humor and manage to make people laugh and make them happy.
- With each film, I get more and more involved and it's more and more time-consuming. Also, I like to break myths and people's preconceived ideas. My characters have always stood for something, have always had an opinion, although they've never really rebelled.
- Do we recognize the platform that Indian cinema has been given? Of course. And typically India of us, we gracefully acknowledge our host's grace and we thank you for celebrating us and our cinema.
- My experience of being on the public platform got more multi-faceted, multi-dimensional, and my place in the public eye, I think, has always been a little more than just what is going on in that time in my life.
- Sexy in India is not considered positive. But, with today's crop of fresh faces in the modelling arena, being sexy is an asset.
- The larger the audience the better. The more pockets in the world, the more interesting and exciting because it just makes it that much more liberating. This makes it that much more liberating for the various facets of creativity to be explored.
- Strangely, nothing makes me feel tired, fatigued, at all. I've gone days and nights without sleep, and still the mind is in such a positive space it just doesn't make you feel fatigued.
- Life will take its toll on all of us. We get injured, we get old. It's really sad to try to run away from these harsh realities of life. Looks are not everything. I am not going to look beautiful all the time.
- I was more excited than scared, at the opportunity to work in an English movie.
- I'm not the type who'll yell about my achievements from the rooftops.
- I don't know about changing my perspective, because motherhood is such a glorious blessing and I am very thankful for that. It's such a beautiful experience. I so strongly recommend it. It's bliss, love and fulfillment of another level.
- I always believed that my silence on several topics will be an advantage in the long run.
- I really don't work to a plan, but I just do what interests me and what I like to do.
- The more you are blessed with experience, the fuller and the more enriched you are in your craft.
- In terms of finding that first international recognition of my work, coming back to Cannes is such a milestone in my life because it began actually with 'Devdas'.
- It's unbelievable that people have the time and inclination to be as negative as they are on a public platform about people who accomplish whatever they do in the public eye.
- I just take on what I can commit to completely at that point in time, and that way you'll be able to give your best.
- I always knew I would be successful. So there was no element of surprise.
- I'm a student. I want to do better, and I want directors who can find the actress in me and be my teachers. I'm interested in the whole process of editing, post-production and direction.
- I'm just an average woman with average concerns.
- I know for a fact that if there's a role which I am suited for, I'll be signed on. I'll never go begging.
- My family is my strength and my weakness.
- Weight gain can happen at any point in time, and it is something that you are dealing with anyway, and it is OK. It is ridiculous to have this dictate your very being because I have always said that it is not the outside that defines who you are.
- Even in Indian cinema, there is so much work that I have accepted because I'm comfortable and so much I have declined because I haven't been comfortable.
- Even prior to marriage and motherhood, it's always been about prioritising and focusing on what you can commit to. That's been my approach to every aspect of my life, be it my relationships or my professional commitments.
- I am really OK with the way I look. It's fine. All this is transient. I mean, it's really, you know, it changes with time, and that's the external.
- Right now, I'm following the Buddhist principle: Smile as abuse is hurled your way and this too shall pass.
- What's blessed about my life is that I have been able to connect with the global audience on a regular basis. I am thankful for everybody's love, and I reciprocate that, but I also have to deliver on every occasion.
- I have a great story to tell... and I tell it well. No holds barred.
- I like to be human and not lose myself in becoming a mannequin, which people in showbiz are accused of.
