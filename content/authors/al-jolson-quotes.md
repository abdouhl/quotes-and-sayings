- A responsive audience is the best encouragement an actor can have.
- I recall the night that President McKinley died. I was working at the time at a theatre in St. Louis. The oppressive feeling was in the air. I could not make the people laugh.
- After I die, I'll be forgotten.
- I have seen and heard comedians who had really funny 'stuff' but yet could not make the people laugh; then, again - I have seen others whose stuff was anything but humorous, and the audience would howl with laughter.
- I'd like to do radio just like pictures - leave the imperfect stuff on the cutting-room floor.
