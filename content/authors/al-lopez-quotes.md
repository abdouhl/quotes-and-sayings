- Managing can be more discouraging than playing, especially when you're losing because when you're a player, there are at least individual goals you can shoot for. When you're a manager all the worries of the team become your worries.
- Everybody says we hated the Yankees. We didn't hate the Yankees. We just hated the way they beat us.
- I'm delighted. I don't know of anybody who had a statue built of them while they were living. It's a great feeling.
- Do what you love to do and give it your very best. Whether it's business or baseball, or the theater, or any field. If you don't love what you're doing and you can't give it your best, get out of it. Life is too short. You'll be an old man before you know it.

- I usually stick out my hand and hope he puts the ball in it. Except the one time I went out to take Early Wynn out. I stuck out my hand and he hit me right in the stomach with the ball.
- They say anything can happen in a short series. I just didn't expect it to be that short.
