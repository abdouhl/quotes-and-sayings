- If you become a viral star, that is terrific!
- Telling people that I wanted to make dance music, or be on the radio, they looked at me like I was crazy because there was nothing like that in Lichtenstein when I was getting started. That's why I went to Germany, because there is industry there.
- I traveled the world as a DJ, as a singer, as a songwriter, as a producer.
- I have always made commercial music. The people who vote for the Grammy nominees are mostly in their 40s and have other jobs or are musicians themselves. They like music that they can relate to - they like commercial music.
- I started from nothing in Lichtenstein. The country is so small, and the only 'celebrity' type people who are from there are skiers.
