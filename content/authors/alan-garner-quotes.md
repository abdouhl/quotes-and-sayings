- My great-grandfather was a self-taught man, and his library was extraordinary. I read the lot.
- I learnt that I must never finish a book with nothing else to do.

- I've learned never to try and force words to come.
- My mother read nursery rhymes to me, and my grandmother told me folk stories, but as a child I had no interest in writing whatsoever.
