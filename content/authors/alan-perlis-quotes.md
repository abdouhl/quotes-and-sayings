- Is it possible that software is not like anything else, that it is meant to be discarded: that the whole point is to always see it as a soap bubble?

- We toast the Lisp programmer who pens his thoughts within nests of parentheses.
- In English every word can be verbed. Would that it were so in our programming languages.
- LISP programmers know the value of everything and the cost of nothing.
- Computer Science is embarrassed by the computer.
- It is easier to write an incorrect program than understand a correct one.
- A year spent in artificial intelligence is enough to make one believe in God.
- A picture is worth 10K words - but only those to describe the picture. Hardly any sets of 10K words can be adequately described with pictures.
- If your computer speaks English, it was probably made in Japan.

- Simplicity does not precede complexity, but follows it.
- The best book on programming for the layman is 'Alice in Wonderland'; but that's because it's the best book on anything for the layman.
- A programming language is low level when its programs require attention to the irrelevant.
- In software systems it is often the early bird that makes the worm.
- I think it is inevitable that people program poorly. Training will not substantially help matters. We have to learn to live with it.
- If you have a procedure with 10 parameters, you probably missed some.
- Fools ignore complexity. Pragmatists suffer it. Some can avoid it. Geniuses remove it.
