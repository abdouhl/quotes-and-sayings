- I am a firm believer that one way to become enlightened is to be so relaxed, as relaxed as you possibly can be.
- I'm excited about there being more of a sisterhood these days. Back in the '90s there was a lot of hate - the women I looked up to as artists were dissing me! It's not so patriarchal these days - there's more love and a lot less hate!
- We're taught to be ashamed of confusion, anger, fear and sadness, and to me they're of equal value to happiness, excitement and inspiration.

- Knowing that people make my songs their own is what keeps me going.
- I want to walk through life instead of being dragged through it.
- There was a period of time during the 'Jagged Little Pill' era where I don't think I laughed for about two years. It was a survival mode, you know. It was an intense, constant, chronic over-stimulation and invasion of energetic and physical literal space.

- And ultimately the people who produce my records, they know that they're here to serve the purpose of me expressing who I am at this period of time and augmenting that or pulling it forward and I love that process.
- The thing you can't underestimate is the true fan's intimacy. So Lady Gaga or anybody's true fan, I don't think they're going anywhere. There are people who are into commitment. If they're connecting with an artist, I think they'll be there over the long course.

- I can't not write, if I don't then I get really depressed.

- There were a lot of people who were a little afraid of the rage or blaming stance I was taking, and find what I am doing now more refreshing.
- My greatest achievement is being able to write records that are real snapshots of what's going on in my life. I won't repeat myself for the sake of commerce, or to please other people.
- To me the biggest irony of this lifetime that I'm living is that for someone who thrives in the public eye in the creative ways that I do, I actually don't enjoy being in the public eye.
- What's that line from TS Eliot? To arrive at the place where you started, but to know it for the first time. I'm able to write about a breakup from a different place. Same brokenness. Same rock-bottom. But a little more informed, now I'm older. Thank God for growing up.
- I'm really clear about what my life mission is now. There's no more depression or lethargy, and I feel like I've returned to the athlete I once was. I'm integrating all the parts of me - jock, musician, writer, poet, philosopher - and becoming stronger as a result.
- My parents offered me the idea of ceilinglessness. There was no limit in terms of what was possible; no messages sent to me to say that I couldn't do anything.
- I highly recommend getting older! There's less tendency to people-please.
- I wish people could achieve what they think would bring them happiness in order for them to realize that that's not really what happiness is.
- Trauma happens in relationships, so it can only be healed in relationships. Art can't provide healing. It can be cathartic and therapeutic but a relationship is a three-part journey.
- I need to be performing. I need to be acting. I need to be designing a condo and ripping down walls and buying new plates and looking at fashion magazines. There always has to be some movement in the artistic department for me to not get really, really low.
- I think it's irresponsible when celebrities imply they're doing it all themselves. My son has aunties and uncles around all the time, and my husband is my hero. He's really full-on. I couldn't do it any other way.
- I'm clearly most well known for my music. Eventually, ultimately, I'll be writing books. I'm still writing articles now. I just consider myself a writer.

- I couldn't be touring unless my husband was on the road with me, taking care of our son while I'm onstage and doing interviews.
- When I was younger, I was terrified to express anger because it would often kick-start a horrible reaction in the men in my life. So I bit my tongue. I was left to painstakingly deal with the aftermath of my avoidance later in life, in therapy or through the lyrics of my songs.
- I could get away with not taking care of myself as a bachelorette but as a mom I can't.
- I think a beautiful quality that's a biological, hormonal imperative for women, whether they have children or not, is that we're built to be empathic. For me, it was finally being maternal in an appropriate way instead of trying to mommy ex-boyfriends.
- I still indulge in a glass of wine or chocolate - treats are mandatory. Without deviating from the day-to-day healthy diet once in a while, it wouldn't be sustainable for me, and that's what I wanted: an approach to eating to last my entire life.
- When someone says that I'm angry it's actually a compliment. I have not always been direct with my anger in my relationships, which is part of why I'd write about it in my songs because I had such fear around expressing anger as a woman.
- The spirituality that I experience sometimes touches on religion, in that I resonate with the thread of continuity that permeates through all religions. But in terms of it being a concretized, organized part of my life, it's not.
- It's a joke to think that anyone is one thing. We're all such complex creatures. But if I'm going to be a poster child for anything, anger's a gorgeous emotion. It gets a bad rap, but it can make great changes happen.
- I find as an artist if I'm not expressed relatively consistently, I get really depressed.
- A lot of preconceived notions that I had about fame and status and money and joy and pain, and all of these things that I thought I knew, I didn't.

- Unless I really loved it and felt really passionate about it, I would just kind of abort the song and start a new one.
- There's a continuity between what I care about in any form: I care about it in my music, in article-writing, in how I dress, in how I live, in my relationships, in how I navigate paparazzi, how I decorate my home. There's such a continuity between everything that I don't really care what form it shows up in.
- Down the road, I'll probably have a kid or two or three. And there will probably be political events or spiritual things to comment on, and humor.
- But I love to entertain. My vocation is to accrue all these experiences, to write about them, to get them out of my system, to not get sick, and then to share them publicly.
- I know that I'm deeply, spiritually, profoundly philosophical and I also know that I'm about the flakiest person you're gonna meet.
- I was 9 when I wrote 'Fate Stay with Me.' It was this fictional song about romance gone wrong.
- I guess what people forget sometimes is that when I write songs, I write them sometimes in about 20 minutes.
- Courage and willingness to just go for it, whether it is a conversation or a spontaneous trip or trying new things that are scary - it is a really attractive quality.
- I've just always felt it's an incredibly empowering thing, particularly for young women, to capitalize on their coordination and their strength. It's a very empowering thing to feel strong in your body.
- I did commit to myself that I would not jump back into being the workaholic that I can be before I gave myself an honest opportunity to create the marriage of my dreams and to create the beginning of the family of my dreams, and that took a hot second.
- At some point, I would like to write a book and other things, but I work best when there is some sort of deadline in my own mind, but not when fifty people or fifty million people are breathing down the back of my neck.

- But once I acclimated and really used fame for what it was offering me as a tool to serve my life purpose of inspiring and contributing, then it started to get fun again.
- I remember thinking during those times that I wanted to write in a way where there are no rules.
- As long as I can say what it is that I need to say, then I'll fit whatever I'm trying to say around a melody.
- I see my body as an instrument, rather than an ornament.
- I think some fans want everything to stay they same because they want to stay the same.
- I'm about 90 percent vegan. I think veganism is really well suited for training, at least for me anyway.
- I found that the more truthful and vulnerable I was, the more empowering it was for me.
- I make up new lyrics to well-known lullabies. Mostly because I don't actually know a lot of the lyrics.
- When I start writing songs and it turns into an overly belabored intellectual process, I just throw it out.
- I think fame became exciting for me in the late '90s because I could actually use it as a means to an end. I could actually have it help me serve my vocationfulness.
- I really do see that anywhere I am, whether it's doing interviews a hundred in a row, that every situation I'm in, I'm at choice in the matter.
- What influenced me was Tori Amos, who was unapologetic about expressing anger through music, and Sinead O'Connor. Those two in particular were really moving for me, and very inspiring, before I wrote 'Jagged Little Pill.'
- You live, you learn.
- Breakups are a horrible thing for almost everybody I know. For someone who is a love addict, it's debilitating.
- For four to six months at a time, I would barely eat. I lived on a diet of Melba toast, carrots, and black coffee.
- Typically I go in the studio and whatever I'm contemplating that day will wind up being a song. I don't come in with lyrics... I just go in and let it happen.
- There were websites erected to figure out how to kill Alanis. I just do not need to see this; it's not good for anybody.
- I try to keep a low profile in general. Not with my art, but just as a person.
- When I'm off the road, my husband and I recharge our batteries. It's a day of deep rest and connection with the spiritual, and that can be anything - going for a walk in nature, being in silence, burning incense.
- If I could sell 500 million records every time, it would be great. But I've also had the luxury experience of having it when I was a teenager, in a very kind of model version of it.
- My message to anyone who's afraid that they can't write music when they're happy is 'Just trust the passion.' The passion can write a lot of things.
- I love to get to the underbelly of why people are up in arms about anything. Really, what I see is a big shadow in the West, in America especially, and everyone's afraid of looking stupid. But the truth is, I'm a genius and I'm stupid at the same time.
- I saw music as a way to entertain people and take them away from their daily lives and put smiles on their faces, as opposed to what I see it being now, which is a way for me to actually communicate, and a way for me to tap into my subconscious.
- Part of being famous is offering up this blank screen upon which people can project everything, and it's a sacred act, putting yourself out there, in a way that lots of celebrities aren't steeled for; they're not prepared for the degree to which people define them.
- The fear of this delicate and fierce feminine has more to do with our fear of being vulnerable again, getting hurt again, than it does by our actual distaste for the beauty of the feminine and Her qualities.
- Peace of mind for five minutes, that's what I crave.
- I've always been really opinionated, and mixed with being really open hearted, open to people shifting what I think all the time, but I like to speak with conviction.
- Making a movie requires 20 to 500 people to make and a lot of money and the stakes are a lot higher.
- Anything I do has to be directly related to my music. If it isn't, I don't really see a point to it.
- My own approach has always been to push intense emotions down and attempt to deal with them later. When I was younger, I was terrified to express anger because it would often kick-start a horrible reaction in the men in my life.

- As a teen, I was both anorexic and bulimic.
- I'll be writing records until I'm dead, whether people like it or not!
- In the face of patriarchy, it is a brave act indeed for both men and women to embrace, rather than shame or attempt to eradicate, the feminine.
- We live, in North America in general, if I'm given the indulgence of selling us down the river, in a culture of fear of this connective sense of spirit.
- The whole celebrity thing is not something I'm overly interested in. I don't pop up at parties. It's just not my thing.
- My main objective with every album is to capture a moment in time, which usually makes the whole process very relaxing. I only discover in retrospect when looking back at the songs how my life is going!
- Do I appreciate the idea of jealousy, revenge and all these so-called dark qualities? Yes. Do I write these songs in order to engage in some public war with someone? No.
- My son was five months old, and I built a makeshift studio in my living room so that I could do the attachment parenting approach and write the record at the same time. That was fortuitous, that we could build that in the house.
- I like to make pasta with puttanesca sauce and arugula salad.
- Beauty is now defined by your bones sticking out of your decolletage. For that to be the standard is really perilous for women.
- My brother says that I was writing songs about fate while he was off playing soccer. Now I tell him he's 33 and being a professional while I'm playing soccer with my friends. Ha!
- I'll keep evolving and put that into my songs.
- Fame is hollow. It amplifies what is there. If there is any self-doubt, or hatred, or lack of ability to connect with people, fame will magnify it.
- It's when someone has an agenda of their own for the record that it doesn't work for me.
- I live with some of my best friends from high school, very commune-like, in my house. It's my hippie way of life.
- I happen to be lucky in that I knew what I wanted to do as far as a career since I was nine years old.
- I was taught from a young age that I had to serve, so that turned into me thinking I had to save the planet.
- The thing I always default to is that I'll always be here to write songs.
- I was left to painstakingly deal with the aftermath of my avoidance later in life, in therapy or through the lyrics of my songs.
- I was motivated by just thinking that if you had all this external success that everyone would love you and everything would be peaceful and wonderful.
- Europe seems a little softer, but in America it's harsh. In L.A., where I live, it's all about perfectionism.
- I grew up in a very masculine environment. So I was around a lot of men, my brothers and their friends. There was just a lot of guys around.
- I'll be writing records until I'm dead, whether people like it or not! I can't not write; if I don't, then I get really depressed. I'll keep going, I promise!
- I thought the more famous I became, the more friendships I would have, but the opposite was true.
- There's cleanliness to how I eat now. I'm much more in tune with my body, so now that I'm so in tune based on having become a semivegan, I can tell what foods affect energy levels. I can tell when I've been eating particularly high nutrient foods or I can tell when my glycemic levels are all over the place.
- Getting married and starting a family has been a lifelong goal and one that I have persevered through different paths up to it!
- I think there is no better way to invite a human being to view their body differently than by inviting them to be an athlete, by revering one's body as an instrument rather than just an ornament.
- I'm a liability to them - I'm a woman, I'm empowered, I'm an artist. I've had executives who can't come to my shows they're so scared of me. I've been a thorn in many people's sides just by existing.
- I love songs that are very autobiographical.
- I'm quite obsessed with the idea of nailing the girl friendship. It's such an art, so delicate.
- I want to poke holes in the erroneous beliefs about what fame provides. It won't raise your self-esteem, it won't create profound connection, it's not going to heal your childhood traumas, it's only going to amplify them. You're going to be subject to a lot of criticism and praise, both of which are violent in their own ways.
- Only traumatised people want to be famous.
- At one point, I was just perceived as only being angry, but now I'm being perceived as angry, peaceful, and spiritual.
- I don't want to offend people and I don't want to be mean, but social commentary and comedy for me are part and parcel. I think the greatest social activists are comedians.
- Ageism works in both directions. As a teenager in the public eye, people would talk condescendingly to me. When you get older there's this feeling that you have to start carving up your face and body. Right now I'm in the middle ground - I think women in their thirties are taken seriously.
