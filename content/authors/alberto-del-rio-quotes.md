- Everybody knows I work every single day, I never rest, and I always work to give my best to the fans.
- I'm one of those wrestlers that leaves everything to the audience and to the fans. I never plan anything, and you will never see Alberto Patron planning in the back what he is going to do in the match.
- It's easy for a multi-billion company like WWE - it's for a company like that to hire anyone. So I'm glad Bobby Lashley is back in action with that company, 'cause he's a fantastic guy.

- Returning to WWE before retiring is not a question of whether they want to or I want to return. Neither I hope nor want to return, nor do they expect me to return or want me to return.
- John Cena is fantastic, seriously. I hate when people don't give Cena the credit he deserves.
- WWE is a PG and a family product. Everybody can watch and enjoy WWE, whereas in the past, the parents were worried about what their kids were watching because of the blood, foul language, etc.

- For people like me, who appreciate the love and respect you get from the fans in Japan, there was no reason for me to turn my head to the other side and go try my options and luck in the UFC.
- I have been saying this from the beginning: people are going to say whatever they want to say or believe whatever they want to believe. I say this to people: stick to the facts.
- Putting yourself in the ring to wrestle - create those emotions, ups and downs within the match - one moment dominates the one, and one moment dominates the other, and without having created a choreography, that is the real wrestling.
- My first six months were in Japan; then I went to Mexico and then went back to Japan. I had the opportunity to wrestle all the wrestlers from the United States, Europe, and Japan when I was there.
