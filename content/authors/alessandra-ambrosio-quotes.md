- I don't really drink sodas, but when I have popcorn or pizza I need a little. It's the perfect combination.
- I love to eat and I love sweets... like chocolate. But I do work out.
- I've been tiny since I was four, and I eat whatever I want.
- If I'm two pounds heavier, I'm fat. If I'm skinnier, I'm sick. It's ridiculous. And that's not coming from agents or designers.
- And my daughter really likes Justin Bieber, so I think she'll have fun watching him. But I think Rihanna is the perfect match for the Victoria's Secret show because she's really beautiful, she's really sexy, and she's really talented.
- Here in America, people are very professional.
- I don't feel that comfortable being on the runway with a G-string. I shoot G-strings with Victoria's Secret, but on the runway... It's really about the moment. I work with professionals. Professional people make everything look perfect, they make everything that you're wearing look great, if it's in a picture or on the runway.
- I think I'm in better shape now than I was 10 years ago, but it takes a bigger toll - I get back pain!
- When you're pregnant you just want to be comfortable - but I wear more or less the same as I do when I'm not pregnant: pregnancy denim with normal tops and flat shoes. But when the belly starts to really stick out, I'll want the floaty dresses!
- You know, I have a kid on my own, and I know how busy it is, the first weeks and the first month.
- Seriously, I like to wear hats so I don't get super tan. You have to protect the face.
- Professional people make everything look perfect, they make everything that you're wearing look great, if it's in a picture or on the runway.
- Russell James asked me to shoot underwater. He tied my feet under the water. I don't know how many feet - maybe five, six meters. He tied me underwater and I had no air. Somebody had a tube, and they were giving me some oxygen, but I couldn't really see anything. Everything was blurry. I'm waiting for the oxygen - that was the craziest thing.
- I have been lucky enough to work with the world's best designers and top stylists - who have been my mentors.
- In the summer I wear shorts with a bright top and ankle boots or just sandals. I'll add a nice scarf, maybe a hat, some cool sunglasses. It's all about the accessories.
- My little girl, Anja, is really excited. We had a baby shower yesterday and she took the presents from everyone for me and was telling them, 'No, it's my baby.'
- I like to dress pretty basic during the day, but with a sophisticated bohemian spin, and sometimes a little rock chic. At night I like to go glamorous.
- It isn't hard to stay in shape.
- I am extremely excited to develop and design a brand representative of my life, experiences and style. Working closely with Cherokee will help establish a worldwide presence with best-in-class retailers and category leaders.
- I'm not thinking about me that much anymore. Every time I look, I'm looking for my daughter, you know? If I'm in a store, I'm looking at baby clothes. It's so much cuter to find things for her than to find things for me.
- I love everybody that I work with, and we have so much fun.
- I have a Brazilian trainer here in New York and we do a Brazilian Butt Lift workout.
- The designers usually don't like to say until we're on the runway. Like when I did Prada last year, I couldn't mention doing Prada or even Tweet or take a picture and put it on Twitter saying I was backstage at the Prada show. And Dolce was the same thing. They like to keep a little surprise, I guess, a little secret for everybody.
- I try to do yoga once a week.
- One of my favorite beauty products is Vincent Longo Water Canvas creamy blush. I have it in every color and I've been using it for 5 years and that's all I put on when I leave the house. It looks so natural I just put a little bit on my cheeks to give them some color.
- I've seen Bruno Mars before, he's amazing.
- Before, models had that rock star life and it was all about going to the parties and having that glamorous life, and I think these days, models are more like businesswomen and the whole industry takes it really serious.
- My favourite part... I guess it's my legs.
- As long as you're feeling good with your weight and the way you look, that's what matters.
- I love Cheetos, those hot, spicy kind. And chocolate. Every time I'm in the airport I'm buying Cheetos and eating them on the airplane.
- I've been a fashion model for 15 years and designing is just an extension of my career. I still plan on modeling lingerie, but at the same time this is a business transition that I plan to have around for a long time.
- All that matters is that I stay healthy.
- I love sunglasses, I have all shapes and colors.
