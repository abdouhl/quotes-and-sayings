- My mother wanted my sister and me to live a normal life. I always picked friends who weren't impressed with my family ties.
- The thing that I hate the most is when people have prejudice - when they see me as the granddaughter of Benito Mussolini and not as Alessandra. That, really, I don't like. I didn't know my grandfather. I am me.
- I have the courage of youth, and I'm not afraid of anything. My only enemies are illegality and corruption.
- My satisfaction is the people. They are very in love with what I represent for them. I represent what my grandfather did for Italy, a new generation, a future for the youth: a commitment in life, not just passing by.
- If my name were Pasolini or Rossi, my life would be easier. But I never thought of changing it. That would mean that I am ashamed to be Alessandra Mussolini, which is stupid because Alessandra Mussolini never did anything to be ashamed of.
- Even if I make a fortune in films, I want to have a diploma so I don't finish life as a little clerk.
- My grandfather created a big family in Italy. He protected the family; he helped them in hospitals and stuff like that.
- I am not docile. If I see that something is wrong, I will say so. I am not sweet.
- I don't believe in political strategies. I believe only to do good for the people.
- I work with the people in the piazza, where there is reality. Here in Parliament, often there is a mystification of reality. They are not representatives of the people. They represent themselves and their own interests.
- Acting was not for me. They were saying, you are too beautiful, you are too ugly, you are too plump, too tall, too short. You cannot believe the way you are judged.
- I don't like compromise. In politics, you have to always choose a compromise, and sometimes, that, I don't like.
- Women are strong. We are strong because we are used to the pain which comes every month. It forms character. I want to see the man who goes to the Parliament with the belly puffed out. They can't do it.
- A dictator keeps control and leads. A tyrant is someone selfish who destroys.
- Obviously, I pay for the fact I was an actress once. But it was a job like any other, because I never did anything scandalous.
- With his gigantic personality, my grandfather burst onto the great political panorama of that era made up only of little men with little ideas.
