- We need to transform our system so people know what they are paying for health care, so they know whether they are getting good quality health care, and so they have a reason and ability to care.

- Immigration policy isn't really what we at HHS do.
- Association health plans will actually bring down the cost of insurance.

- I'm not one to say many good things about Obamacare, but one of the nice things in it is it does give a tremendous amount of authority to the secretary of HHS.

These four Americans fought for the Right to Try because they didn't want to give up.
