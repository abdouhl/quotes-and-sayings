- Any experience that isn't fun is probably something I will at least use in my writing someday.
- Since I've written many of my books from a less-than-sympathetic viewpoint, I think that being able to see things from all sides is a useful talent.
- I enjoy people who aren't afraid to say what they mean. It makes life so much easier!
- Each of my books took roughly one and a half years to write. Some may have taken a shorter time to write the draft and a longer time to revise, while others were the opposite.
- I write contemporary fiction, and that is what my readers want to read.
- Although my other ambition was to be a musical theater star (and I would attend college on a voice scholarship), writing was never far from my mind.
- I was painfully shy, and I had tremendous difficulty making friends. So, lacking friends, I watched other people. Watching is something all writers must do, and it was in junior high that I learned to do it.
- I was a lawyer for about ten years. The law teaches one to see things from all different angles.
- I have a great deal of empathy for anyone who's having a hard time. I believe this ability to see another's viewpoint has served me well as a writer.
- I wrote poetry, journals, and, especially, plays for the neighborhood kids to perform. I had an ordinary, happy childhood. Nothing much was going on, but I had fun.
