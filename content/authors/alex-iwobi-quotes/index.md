- As long as I am progressing and trying to do my best for the team that is what really matters.
- Obviously, people in the media speak a lot when things aren't going right, but we as players do communicate with each other. Maybe it doesn't come across as being loud on the pitch - and you don't see it as much - but we do speak when things aren't going as well as planned.

- Whenever something in the system changes, you have to prove yourself again. But wherever you go, you have to prove that you're better than whoever else is on the team. At a team like Arsenal, that's always going to be hard so I always have to be on it in training and matches.
