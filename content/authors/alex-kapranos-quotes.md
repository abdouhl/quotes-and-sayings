- Ambition is sneered at by some bands. It seems like a pretty good thing to me.
- Cinema, which is influenced by every single part of life, is direct and reaches you immediately. And writing - the best writing is complex ideas communicated concisely. And music - if it's a good tune, make sure people can bloody hear it.
- Men behave very oddly in the company of attractive women.
- Although they might not admit it, I think girls are very aware of the impact that they're having. But they never feel it themselves, and it's impossible to explain. It's like trying to tell a blind person what yellow is.
- Maybe 'Can't Stop Feeling' and 'Turn It On' we'll just release as singles. It's a thing The Beatles used to do which I really loved, the idea of releasing something as a single completely on its own.
- No matter what you do, if you're trying to create something new, your environment has a massive impact on you.
- There's a difference between expectations and aspirations.
- It's easy to be lazy when there's food lying around backstage or there's a fast-food joint a couple blocks away. But if you walk a little further, ask around a bit, of course there are exciting things to discover.
- I didn't grasp the basic principle of being a promoter, which was: Put on music but also generate an income. I was on the dole most of the time.
- I really want it to have an impact on the world. I want to be in a town on the other side of the world, and somebody walks up and says, 'That music you made in Glasgow, I listened to it every day, and it moved me.'
- Traditionally, lots of vagrants and unemployable characters wind up working in kitchens.
- There's a character that I play onstage, and I can't let him loose in the supermarket when I'm buying my beans on toast.
- Surely every band wants to be a pivotal point in history.
- Boredom or being sick of what you've done before is a big part of being in a band.
- You can only begin to be great when you embrace a sense of your own ridiculousness.
- I think a lot of bands are creatively knackered when they come off tour.
- If I was a fan of someone as a teenager, then it's OK for me to feel completely in awe when I meet them.
- Ideally, musicians belong outside the Establishment. When they cross that line, it's like something in them has died.
- A lot of food criticism has a similar flavor to it, and I'm probably going to write about it in a different way.
- Being in a band didn't buy me my beans on toast!
- It's very rare that a song falls from your mind complete.
- Arty. To me the word's got as much venom associated with it as 'wacky'.
- The internet is like a gossipy girls' locker room after school, isn't it?
- Of course, there's a certain type of person who feels that anything which becomes mainstream has to be rejected immediately. And that's part of the indie-alternative snobbery and hierarchy and elitism.
- Just because you can leap off a drum kit doing a scissors kick while hitting a chord, people expect you to be an extrovert socially. But I'm not always comfortable with the idea of small talk at a party.
- The best songwriting comes from being as creative as you can and editing it down to the good bits, essentially.
- Glasgow's not a media center. When you're there, when you're hanging about, you feel quite detached from musical movements or fashions or anything like that. You do feel quite alone, in a good way.
- Why play a chord when you can play one note?
- A lot of bands have the enthusiasm kicked out of them by playing really dreary pub venues that just churn bands through.
- If success had come along when I was 17 it would either have killed me or sent me completely mad.
- I think in the world of indie music there's this sort of false modesty.
- It doesn't matter how adventurous you want to be, you've still got to contain your identity.
- I'd rather eat a cow-pat on a bun than a bloody McDonalds.
- I want to make music that will make the blood surge in your veins, music that will get people up and dance.
- There are loads of bands I'd love to produce.
- I'm not a food critic, and I'm not really an authority to write anything on food.
- Boho to me is a first-year student who's just discovered the tie-dye shop.
- People's musical tastes are fickle, and music can be a fashion.
- You really only understand whether a song's good or not when you properly play it out in public for the first time.
