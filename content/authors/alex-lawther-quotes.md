- I've always wanted to keep my foot in film as well as theatre and be working in both worlds.
- Bette Midler is this sort of laser-precise whirlwind. We only worked together for two days, but her precision, before even shooting, was remarkable.
- Hiding behind a tougher outer image as a teenager feels cooler and safer compared to admitting, perhaps, that you're the very opposite.
- That's one thing that attracts me to roles the most - how much potential there is for me to learn from it.
- Winnie the Pooh was such a part of my childhood. My kindergarten was named Pooh Corner, after one of A.A. Milne's collections of stories.
- Everyone has a freak flag inside them. Whether they're brave enough to show it is another matter.
- Particularly with Netflix, there are some series you just binge-watch. But I think with 'Black Mirror,' it's a joy to have some space between each one.
- We have something very powerful in our hands with the Internet, and we still don't really understand fully its power.
- I didn't think I ever knew how one managed to be so lucky as to work in this industry. It was a dream I was a little bit embarrassed by.
- One big power of an actor is knowing when to say no to something. It can be very tempting to say yes to something, because you're flattered that somebody would like to work with you, and your ego sort of takes over, but it's important to ask whether there could be something you could add to a project by being part of it.
- My dream really is just to keep working in film and in theatre.
- Technology really helps our daily lives, but things like location services are actually quite creepy.
- I'm a massive Roald Dahl fan. I grew up reading his work and see a recurring theme - I have continued to love stuff that mixes the gruesome with a sort of humour. I'm drawn to that in my work.
- 'Black Mirror,' now being on Netflix, can reach all kinds of different people all over the world - with the help of the Internet, rather ironically.
- I love being scared, and I always have done. When I was younger, I was always reading books about the paranormal, UFOs, and crop circles. I liked the idea of people seeing faces in walls and twins that could communicate with each other telepathically. I really believed it, too!
- Saoirse Ronan is just remarkable.
- Sometimes I've made mistakes and not really listened to my instincts, and I've done a project, and I've been disappointed with the consequence, I think, as a consequence of not listening to whatever part of me it is that, at its base, is interested in telling interesting stories.
- If I'm being honest, yes, I've always been into the underdog instead of the golden boy or guy with the easy life. It doesn't seem that dramatic from a storied perspective to play someone that has it easy or is incredibly normal.
- One of the things I'll always remember from my time with 'Black Mirror' is the sense of all the tongue and cheek, and very, very dark sense of comedy there, too.
- I love period drama as much as the next person, but there's a tendency to let all of the costume get in the way of the people.
- I don't know if it's a consequence of 'Black Mirror,' but I am slowly becoming more and more technophobic.
- During teenager times, the feelings of longing is perhaps at its most strong and profound because everything feels multiplied by ten.
- I think, having grown up with the Internet, things like trolls and the world of having an online life as well as a physical one, it's something I've grown up with.
- At the end of the day, what you're able to work on is what comes by you, what sort of floats by you.
- I'm lucky enough to live in London, which is a boiling pot of every kind of language and background and demographic and sexuality and gender, and yet most of what we're seeing in the cinema is not reflective of that.
