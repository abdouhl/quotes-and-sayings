- Nat doing 'Fault' was the greatest thing for our band, and the only reason that our song got in it because Nat was screaming it in the movie. Now we can say that we have a song in 'Fault in Our Stars,' and we have a thousand fans who went to listen to our music because we performed at an event for 'Fault in Our Stars.'
- I think my favorite song is by Led Zeppelin called 'Good Times Bad Times,' a Rolling Stones song called 'You Can't Always Get What You Want,' and every song The Beatles ever wrote.
- What can I say? I'm a complicated guy.
- Every day, I get into fights with my brother, who is the most annoying person on the planet.
- I had a very rainbow-colored childhood.
- I like L.A., I really do, but I'm really a New Yorker. In New York, there's a feeling that you're not praised or treated too preciously. No one ever feels too important because someone on the subway will reassure you that you're not.
- I've always done things that were true to me.
- I relate to Michael Keaton's character in 'Birdman' so much, how he has that voice being so mean and then another boosting his confidence.
- I'm lactose intolerant, so usually pizza makes me feel horrible. But I'll occasionally go very hard and do pizza and pineapple.
- My mornings start with mom coming into my bedroom and waking me up, or trying to wake me up, and then I go back to sleep. Then my mom wakes me up again and yells at me. Then she'll get me to wake up, and I'll get dressed and go to school. We go to school, and my teacher tells me that I didn't do the homework well enough. And that's that.
- 'The House Of Tomorrow' offered such a fantastic script. I couldn't believe that script - it was just so original and unique.
- If they made a movie about Bob Dylan, I would love to play a young Bob Dylan; I mean, I've got the wild hair.
- 'Divorce' was kind of strange because I was going in and out of doing it while doing different movies! So, I kept returning to a set character and this set gig, and that was kind of interesting for me as an actor.
- I can't imagine a world where I wouldn't have the means of expression. When I talk to people who don't, it seems like they're really unhappy.
- It's harder for me to relate to people who don't have families that are loud and crazy.
- I've enjoyed all of the roles I have played for different reasons, which is the great thing about acting. You love different projects for different reasons.
- With all the movies and stuff that we do, it always does feel like this is our home base when Nat and I are playing music. Because we do acting, and that's so fun, and we do it, and we're really passionate for it, but when I'm playing music with Nat - I don't know how to really explain it - it just feels right.
- I think Milly Shapiro is a genius. She's just a fantastic person and a fantastic actress.
- I got mobbed at a pizza parlor. Kids and especially girls went going crazy. They got so excited.
- Yeah, I'll basically do anything to make money for food.
- I've been in front of the camera since the sonogram.
- A guy came up to me in the park and asked if I wanted to buy his CD. I said sure. He got panicked and told me he didn't actually have a CD, and he started crying and then told me he never made it and he's really sorry and called me 'Ralph.' New York's a really weird place.
- 'Catcher In The Rye' was my favorite book, honestly. I read it when I was thirteen, and the book was a bit of a family heirloom because it was passed down from my grandfather to my father to my older brother and then to me.
- The closest thing to religion our family had was worshipping The Beatles.
- There's no one more supportive of each other than me and Nat. We go to each other's premieres and say, 'My brother's the best,' and, 'I liked my brother before it was cool.'
- I'm kind of like an open wound all the time, and that's hard. It's hard to deal with, especially in this industry. Every time I leave a movie, I feel like I'm going to die. Because you connect with these people, and then they all leave. I wish I wasn't like that, but I am.
- People are often very limiting to themselves and can be their own worst enemy.
- The funny thing about 'The Naked Brothers Band' movie was that we tricked the audience into thinking that we were actually rock stars.
- When I'm acting, I do what I'm supposed to do.
- I would love to work with Dustin Hoffman, John Malkovich, Omar Epps, Martin Scorsese, Josh Mond, Woody Allen, Paul Thomas Anderson, and David O. Russell, just to name a few. Those guys are absolutely brilliant at what they do.
- It was so interesting going to high school in New York. You get a callous to the city and an empathy for every type of person.
- I'm crazy, funny, and good looking!
- If I'm 'the kid from 'Hereditary'' for the rest of my life, I'll be satisfied.
- We're always writing music no matter what. And we're not always acting - we have months off. But we never take a break from songwriting.
- It was fun in its own way, but I think 'Dahmer' was ultimately one of the most rewarding experiences of my life and my career.
- I think Nat's an amazing actor... He understands things about acting that most people don't.
- There were many times when I could have gone down the path of being a child star, which I know can be bad; I think, especially in L.A., it's easy to get caught up in that life.
- Reading is important because it makes you smarter and lets you find out about things you're curious about.
- Me and the Rock do look a lot alike, and we're a similar build - that was a joke, by the way.
- I'm obsessed with New York. I want to marry it, maybe bear a few children with 42nd Street.
- I give myself pep talks. I have to tell myself how sexy I am - literally every day. I do. I look in the mirror and say, 'You are so sexy,' because everything else in my body is telling me, 'No, you're not.'
- I have lots of best friends, but my brother is the main one.
- My favorite movies are movies from the '70s, like 'Midnight Cowboy' and 'Dog Day Afternoon' and 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,' and to me, 'Hereditary' seemed like it fit in with those movies, and it was just horrifying. It seemed like it took the things that I love about movies and really fleshed out characters.
- I was going to be a doctor, but who makes it as a doctor anymore?
- I'm never comfortable being in front of the camera, but I've learned how to deal with it.
- As far as 'Dahmer' and 'Jumanji' are concerned, with both of them, they felt super raw and affecting, but in their own ways. I also thought 'Jumanji' was completely not trying to be anything except what it was, and I found it to be hilarious.
- Even if you don't want to admit it, I think when you're in 10th grade, you're never more sensitive in your life. You're just so vulnerable and so angry, or at least I was.
