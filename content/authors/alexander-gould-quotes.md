- I've actually always been a big fan of seafood. Sushi is one my favorite things.
- I think being on 'Weeds,' in general, makes it hard to think of me as Nemo anymore.
- Acting was important, but it was not as important as getting an education, and I credit my parents with a lot of that.
- The great thing about 'Weeds' is that everything we do is never quite serious enough to be taken seriously. It always has humor behind it, and it think it makes it definitely more fun for the audience.
- Yeruham's small. You walk five minutes, and you're in the desert.
- When you get into a film, it is one story and one set development of a character, and you are able to delve into one character for a short period of time and discover everything about them.
- When you're in the entertainment industry, you have to be more mature, be able to hang with the adults.
- I ski, I snowboard, I've started to get into skydiving a little bit. I'm a little bit of a thrill-seeker.
- The Marine Aquarium Council really wants us to keep the coral and the fish safe. They are not saying it is bad to have an aquarium in your house, just that you should make sure when you buy fish for your aquarium... they have been Marine Aquarium Council-certified.
- Practically the whole world depends on coral reefs, so if the coral reefs get all killed, then the ocean will start going out of whack, and if the ocean goes out of whack, something might happen on land.
- It was really weird when I heard my voice coming out of a fish.
- I feel that a lot of roles in television can really typecast someone as one type of actor or playing one type of role, but I really don't think that my role in 'Weeds' did at all.
- In 'Finding Nemo,' all of the voices were recorded separate - so I would be in a sound booth in a studio by myself reading the lines with just the director. Basically, you can just come in, and it doesn't matter what you are wearing or what you look like; it is all about how your voice sounds.
