- I want to beat DC. I want to avenge my loss.
- I'm not satisfied with being ranked second and third.
- I've always seen myself as a big light heavyweight fighter, I have a big frame and walk around quite heavy. So I've always had to cut around 33 lbs to make weight.
- If it was up to me, I wouldn't lose at all, but when it happens, that's when you have to show your real strength.
- A win is a win, but a decision for me is not an option any more.
- A loss is always a loss.
- Every fight is a learning experience, whether it's a win or a loss.
- I didn't and still don't watch sport all that often, but I did see all the Pride fights back in the day, which is when I first saw MMA and I felt that's something I really want to do.
- The main thing I learned in San Diego was I can't do this and compete with the best guys in the world if I'm just doing MMA as a hobby. It has to be my job.

- It's everyone's goal to be a champion and I'm no different.

- Whenever you're training and warming up for the fights, you have your friends around you, you have friends that will compete and we push each other.

- As a 6'5' guy, the suit fit is extremely important. Getting a suit made for my body means it will fit in all the right places. For me, I look for a suit that fits well in the arms and shoulders and allows me to move... after all, I'm a fighter, so it needs to give me room to breathe.
