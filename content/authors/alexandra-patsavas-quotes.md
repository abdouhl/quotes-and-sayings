- I think that 'The Sopranos' uses music incredibly well.
- You know, I'm part of that first MTV generation.
- I was crazy for music as a high school kid and a college kid.
- As a music supervisor, you learn to embrace the best of every genre, and I really have to say there's nothing that I'm embarrassed of.
- In the old days, a TV sync was perceived as not so cool or whittling away at your indie cred. Now it's seen as much more of an opportunity than a sellout, as a way to find fans who wouldn't have ordinarily come across their genre of music.

- The '60s were a time of great change in American music.
- I think it's important to remember that music supervision is not just about a fantastic record collection or knowledge of music, although that certainly helps for aspiring music supervisors.
