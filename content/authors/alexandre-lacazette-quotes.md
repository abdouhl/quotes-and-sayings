- I like to be with Aubam. He's a good boy, a good man, and a good player, and every day, we laugh a lot, so I like to hang out with him. I hope we will score a lot of goals together, can win a lot of games and win some trophies.

- I love good flowing football where the whole team is engaged.

- Dortmund is a great club.
- I can't put everyone in the same bracket, but many haven't got over the old Lacazette and the perception that I was a bit of a lazy striker who didn't really work hard for the team. At least, I thought I was working hard, but I didn't really know how to help my team-mates.
- Arsenal is a well-established club with excellent staff who make sure everything runs smoothly.
- As a No. 9, I have to be there to score goals, but that isn't the only thing. I also participate in the build-up and help my team-mates, but, above all, it's about scoring goals.
- I don't think we have to score in every game in order to have a good game.
- Arsenal are a historic club. Arsene Wenger has been here for such a long time, and there is a real level of stability at the club. He knows what he wants to achieve in the coming years. I liked the way he spoke about football and what he thinks of me.

- There are games where the striker will be useful for the team in terms of creating space and being involved in the game, without necessarily scoring, but he'll have played an important role for the team. But, of course, over the course of a season, I have to score goals, as that's what statistics reflect.
- I would like to reach 100 goals in Ligue 1.

- Everyone has their own career, their own fate, and everyone writes their own story.
- We talked with PSG, but quickly, I knew that it wasn't where I wanted to go. In France, for me, it was only Lyon. PSG could have enabled me to make progress because they have great players, but I wanted to experience another league.

- I've watched quite a few matches to understand English football.
- I like the atmosphere in the Premier League. The teams play attacking football, and for a striker, that is even more attractive.
