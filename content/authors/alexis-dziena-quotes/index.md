- I love college. I know I sound like a dork.
- I used to dance around the house and taught myself the 'Annie' soundtrack. I got into singing and fell in love with it.
- I read a lot of autobiographical stories, and I write plays and prose. And I play piano and cello. A lot of my downtime is devoted to that.
