- I was not the hot, popular girl in school.
- I used to find that I could get mental serenity surrounded by chaos.
- I hang out with dudes a lot. I can relate to being the guys girl.
- There's so much more to me as a human being than just my appearance, and I want to integrate that into my work.
- I'm pretty forgiving, so sometimes I forget how evil people were to me. Then I think, 'Wait a minute. Don't let them get you.' Then I hit 'ignore' on FaceBook.
- I was raised with three bothers, no sisters. I've always been a tomboy.
- You look in the mirror, but you don't see what you actually look like.
- If it's time to party, it's time for hip hop. I love Drake, Jay-Z, Kanye. If I'm chilling at home though, I'm listening to Massive Attack, Thievery Corporation, Radiohead, DJ Shadow. I also listen to a lot of classical.
- Snakes are sick.
