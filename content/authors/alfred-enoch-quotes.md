- I have not seen 'Legally Blonde.' I must be in the small, ever-dwindling minority on that one.
- I don't think of myself as a trendy person at all, and if I'm anything, I'm probably contrarian.
- I struggle with technology. I think it doesn't like me because I think it knows I don't like it.
- I really love my work, so wherever it takes me, I'm happy to be.
- I got told by pretty much everyone I knew that, if I'm going to be out in L.A., working, you need a car. So I was thinking, I'm going to try and not get a car, just because I'm a contrarian that way.
- I think dead humans rising from their graves with little to no sense of who they were in their past lives to mindlessly roam the earth consigning others to the same fate would be a bit depressing.
- Sometimes people are like, 'Hey, you played Dean Thomas!' and I'm like, 'Wow, you actually know!' It kind of shocks me because when I think about movies I love, and if I saw someone who essentially did what I did in Harry Potter, I probably wouldn't recognize them walking down the street.
- I have this strange notion that clothes should be fun.
- I love the Beatles. Now I know I'm a good few decades late on this one, but I've always been behind the curve.
- By the time I was seven, I did a sonnet at Shakespeare's Globe theatre for Shakespeare's birthday because my dad had been at the first season of the Globe and was friends with the artistic director. Somehow, that lead to me doing a sonnet!
- When I was, like, 10, I decided it would look really cool, so I pretended I was British. And I've been doing that ever since.
