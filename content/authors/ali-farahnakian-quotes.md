- The lifelong goal of an improviser is to listen to what the other person is saying, taking it in, and responding.
- Work on your craft, and your career will come. Work on your community, and your career will come. But just work on your career, and you'll have neither a craft nor a community.

- Teaching someone to be funny is like teaching someone to be fast. They're already fast. You're just making them faster.
- There are a million ways of arriving at a performance, any number of them solid.
