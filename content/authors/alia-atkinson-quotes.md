- I am very hopeful that my personal success in Qatar will ignite others, especially those in the so-called non-traditional sports, to try even harder because now they can see for themselves that significant achievements can be attained. But let me stress that it takes a lot of work - in fact, very hard work - mixed with very heavy doses of patience.

- Any person I idolise, or I really admire their work, I want to beat them... For me, going through my years, I made sure to idolise myself... So when you're in a race, you have to make sure that you think you are the favourite to win. You have to have that confidence.
