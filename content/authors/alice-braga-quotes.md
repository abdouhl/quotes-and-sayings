- My father loved 'Godard and Truffaut.' He was more artsy. My mom loved the 'Bourne' trilogy; she likes big blockbusters. She loved that I did 'I Am Legend.' My passion for acting came with my passion for movies.
- I do a lot of research. For 'I Am Legend', I did a lot of research about survivors. If everybody is dead around you, how you can keep surviving. I went to the bookstore and found psychiatry books about survivors from the Holocaust.
- I'm too young to have kids, but I really want to be a mom. I don't know if it's a Latin thing, but I love kids.
- I love the process of discovering a new world - that's why I'm passionate about acting. It's just discovering life, feelings, ideas and thought.
- I wanna work; I love so much making films; I hope I can do one after the other. Being on set is what makes me happy, so... The more I can, the better.
