- I love '90s grunge and punk.
- I was always into punk, ever since I was 13, but I was into other stuff, too - like, well, the Spice Girls. I really liked Scary Spice.
- My style is part of the music I like, the bands I see, the people I surround myself with, the places I go to.
- When I'm drumming, I'm not thinking about much.
- I wish I was more into clothes. I don't know the current designers.
- Some photographers work on the same image for hours and hours and then use the first picture that they took.
- You adapt your look to places you live, where you are and what you are doing.
- I like to be comfortable. And I think men tend to dress more comfortably than ladies. They can just put on a pair of jeans and a sweatshirt, and I like doing that. Comfort first.
- I can understand when people copy people of the past and make the future their own.
- I think it's good to do your own thing and want to be different, and not look like everyone else.
- When I was growing up, my mother always wore Chanel.
- I would have never thought that I'd be doing Chanel.
- Modelling's not something I want to do just on its own, but I always want it to be a part of my life.
- If you're not having fun with your job, it will show.
- When I was little, I was such a tomboy - I loved a baggy T-shirt and leggings.
- I like bags that are easy to wear and are pretty to look at. But I don't like them when they have no space and you can't put anything in them.
- My brother and my dad always used to shave their hair, and I remember thinking, 'Why can't I do the same?'
