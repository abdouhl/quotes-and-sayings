- I can do whatever I want, and I'm not going to let anyone tell me what language I should speak in.
- I love spending time in England, whether it's for writing, producing, or seeing my parents and siblings.
- I get really nervous when I'm performing or meeting new people.
- I actually didn't think there was that many people out there who knew what it's like to not really have a home or have that home in one place.
- I'm putting out music that I love, and they're basically just stories of my life and how I try and teach myself to think about things. They're kind of like notes to self, basically.
- Baking is more like chemistry, following certain instructions and knowing what comes out in the end. It's almost reassuring! Songwriting is a creative process where you go into a session with nothing and can come out of it with something incredible in the end. I never feel like I'm taking a risk with baking, but always with songwriting.
- Mom+Pop aren't just a label, but they were the group of people that seemed to really care about a long-term relationship. I can be honest with them, like I would with my family, but at the same time, I can expect for them always to be upfront and honest with me.
- I loved a lot of the romantic composers.
- I was on the beach, and I was just thinking to myself that I have no one place where I actually feel like I'm at home. I came up with the idea of having no roots - never being grounded to a certain place but having your home with people who you love.
- I wanted to write an upbeat song where I could feel good about the fact that I've moved around so much and not sad about all the goodbyes I've had to face.
- If I don't feel the music, I can't perform it.
- I started quite late. I only discovered that I could write a song when I was, like, 17... some musicians, they're starting out, writing songs when they're, like, 12, 13. I never thought I would go into songwriting when I was that young.
- I don't think I ever had a certain image of what touring was like... I think when you're young, you think it's very glamourous, but it's not.
- I wanted to sing about things that moved me and experiences I had collected throughout life.
- When I was younger, I always wanted to be either a pianist or a classical singer, and when I discovered songwriting, it was like a new portal had been opened.
- At the end of the day, it's not the labels buying the music: it's the people out there, and you have to be behind the music and not anyone else. You're the one representing it, you're playing it for everyone; you're doing promotion and travelling around the world.
- The idea - or, if you like, the need - to write and record 'Lash Out' was born of a feeling within me.
- Every time someone asks me where I'm from, I'm not sure how to answer that question... so I say I have no roots.
- I'm not going to release something just because they think it's the next hit. It's not what everyone wants to hear, but that's the way it is.
- I'm definitely sleep deprived - it is so hard to sleep on a tour bus! It moves around so much, and we have really weird time schedules.
- Like most people, I wanted and still want to live by my own rules.
- We always watch 'The Polar Express.' I love that movie; that's a very, very nice Christmas tradition that we have.
- A lot of labels always feel the need to tell you how they think the music should be marketed and what songs work best where. I say make music you love doing, come up with a strategy, and put it out there.

- Being an artist and a human in this world always means confronting people who make you feel like you have to act according to their rules.
- There's a few kids out there who like singing to my songs. They're, like, five, six, seven years old.
- Home, for me, is with the people who I really love - whether that's in England with my family, Ireland with my relatives, or Germany and Canada with my friends.
- Music is something I can control.
- I didn't want to write a sad song to remind me of the fact that I'm always moving around. I wanted something to cheer me up.
- I had no idea if 'No Roots' was going to work or not.
- I think nowadays it's important to have the support of a group of people who are ready to invest time and effort in your music and vision.
- When I was thirteen years old, and we had just moved to Germany, I definitely felt I was missing out on normal teenage life. I was watching my old school friends from Canada grow up without me while I was in Germany trying to learn the language and trying to pass each year without failing.

- I have complete creative freedom. If I want to put a song on the album, there's no one stopping me.
