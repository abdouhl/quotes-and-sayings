- The Clintons use black people for votes but then don't do anything for black communities after they're elected. They use us for photo ops.

- Coming out of the 2016 election, there was a few things that became really clear. One, that black people deserve to have vehicles that represent the breadth of our interests. Two, that we really need to do a better job of being able to communicate what conditions and experiences our communities are facing.

- Quite frankly, black folks have always been at the core of what it's meant to make this nation human.

And that verdict not only let George Zimmerman go home to his family, but it sent a message to black people everywhere that our lives did not matter.
