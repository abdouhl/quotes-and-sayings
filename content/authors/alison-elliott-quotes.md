- I would love to do an all Laura Nyro show.
- That's one of my problems is that there are so many songs to sing that I sort of get indecisive about what I want to do in a show - because there are so many possibilities! There are so many great songs out there.
- I always wanted to be a character actor. I love watching movies where you don't recognize someone because they're so lost in the part.
- I wasn't a great student. Just give me a school with no grades, and I'll be happy.
- A lot of my albums that I've done, a lot of the songs have been the first take. It's before you mess with it too much - you can take away all the spontaneity and the emotion of something by trying to make it sound perfect.
- I like playing dress-up, and I love pretty jewels, but for me, being a 'movie star' would be a very dangerous place.
- I love originating shows and originating songs - there is nothing better than being the first one to get to do a song.
- It's hard to act in a corset. Your breath gets cut off. You're squashed.
- Drawing attention to myself has never been a goal.
- I realized that acting was something I wasn't going to be lazy about. You feel good when you do it well. It is something that can grow in you.
