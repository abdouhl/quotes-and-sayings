- I am more mature today, so I deal better with the mistakes than the many times when I locked myself away and wanted to be alone.
- There is a lot going on with negotiations in the football business, and I appreciate some people think that it's a crazy, absurd amount of money.
- I've locked myself in my room and wanted to be on my own a lot in my career, but I don't do that anymore.
- We have to learn from our mistakes. But it's part of my game; I won't be arrogant of saying that I will keep doing this. We have to learn from our mistakes.
- I like to show my ability on the field. I'm not one to show off with words. I'm really looking forward to the chance. I'm a calm goalkeeper, and above all, I've got a real desire to win. When I get on the pitch, I give everything for the team, everything for the shirt.
- Goalkeeper is a very influential position, and that is becoming recognised now. If you think about it, any error that we make can be fatal for the team. It can lead to a goal and cause a defeat.
- I will take less risks. When the options aren't appearing, I will clear it into the stands or play a long ball up front.
- If you look at my professional history as a goalkeeper, I'm not somebody who makes many.
- If not the biggest, the Premier League is one of the biggest leagues in the world. It's very competitive, and I find that exciting. I like challenges. I came here because it will be a great challenge for me at a very high level of football and be among these great players in a great team like Liverpool.
- I've always worked really hard, and I'll continue working the same way, whatever the size of the transfer fee.
- I decided with my head to move to Liverpool, but my heart was full of tears. I spent two special years in Rome. My daughter was born there, and I have a lot of friends there outside of football.
- I've got big ambitions, and so do Liverpool, and now I'm playing in the biggest league in the world.
- Play the pass at the right moment - not on a dry pitch and not hitting it hard enough. We don't have to accept it; that was a mistake - no goalkeeper should dribble in this situation.
- Fans with heart problems have to be careful!
- If I hadn't had the guarantee of playing, I would have asked to leave Roma.
- Yes, I'm working on playing with my feet, so I take risks.
- I don't think about numbers. I think more about what I can give back to the club for the faith they have invested in me.
- When I went up from the youth team to the first team at Internacional, it was a risk - they were almost betting on me making it.
- Many times, I'd spend the night walking the city streets: the Trevi fountain, in the dark, is so beautiful it moves you, but the Colosseum is my favourite place - you can breathe history there.
- I actually spoke to all the national team players who play in the Premier League, asking about what the league is like and the style of play. It's one thing watching it on the TV, but being involved in it every day is another thing.
- The difference in the Premier League is that it's very competitive physically, so I'll try to improve in that aspect as well and adapt as soon as possible to the style of play.
- I make a dribble or a simple pass, knowing that if I lose the ball near the area, the opponent can score. I am aware of what I do on the pitch, but I always do it to help the team. That's why, occasionally ,I also boot the ball into the stands.
- My game is characterised by consistency, and that is what has brought me to Liverpool and helped me grow and develop. I like to make simple saves. I don't make saves for the camera.
- I have fitted perfectly in the team and in the team's style of play.
- The Premier League is a very closely contested league.

- My game is characterised by consistency.
- I made a professional decision, a step forward in my career and for Roma, who earned a huge sum.
- I am really happy with the increased recognition that goalkeepers are getting now. I'm glad to be a leading part of that.
- In Rome, I was already trying to help in shaping the game, but the style was a little bit different to what we do at Liverpool.
- I wait for options, hoping that a space for a pass will appear at the last moment.
