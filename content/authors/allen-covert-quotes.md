- Honestly, I just like to make movies. The funnier the better.
- As a parent with young children, I would always find little things that bothered me when I was reading bedtime stories or watching shows or listening to children's music. I couldn't find any stories, games or television shows that were fun and exciting while also being morally instructive and patriotic.
- I've never been called quiet about anything in my life. However, I'm also not one of those people who thinks that because I have been moderately successful at playing make believe for a living that I am supposed to tell you who to vote for.
- Always be prepared; always work hard and take pride in your work no matter what it is. I still follow that advice and have already tried to pass it on to my children. They, of course, ignored me.
- I love IMDB. I love that people all over the country get that into it. When I was a kid, you literally had to go to the theater and stare at the poster to see who the hell was involved.
- I was taught that in this country if you work hard, you can do anything, and I don't see a lot of those principles in children's books today.
- I love jokes that come out of nowhere. The ones where people look at the screen and go, 'What the Hell was that.' As long as it somehow ties back into the story, somehow.
- Personally, I'm a little more confident when I have a script.
- I think if I did do something in another genre, it would be science fiction; I'm a big sci fi nerd.
- I was obsessed with movies when I was younger. During the summer, I would go by myself to a theater down the street from my house. I saw every comedy or science fiction movie that came out. My kids love going to the movies, but 3D scares them.
- Unfortunately, many talented people in Hollywood find their values and politics do not reflect the content they create, and many movie themes are in direct contrast with over half of today's American families.
- Anytime there is a Bigfoot show, where they supposedly have recordings of him, I am watching. I love the idea of Bigfoot. I want him to be out there somewhere.
- I gained the weight on purpose for 'Little Nicky,' and it was one of those cases where I'd done a few roles where I looked the same way, and I wanted to be the roommate because I thought that was the funniest part for me.
