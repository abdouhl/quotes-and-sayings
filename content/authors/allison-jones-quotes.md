- Kids can really get better quickly. Here's another thing I would like to say: Kids should never be coached by their parents, ever. They should be as natural as possible.
- Being funny is everything to me.
- Pretty people don't keep comedies on the air. Funny people keep comedies on the air.
- What I try to do is always get the newest, funniest people in anything.
- I don't ever take credit for discovering anybody, except for McLovin on 'Superbad'.
- I don't really troll the Internet; I'm not young enough.
- I would say take any work you can get. Don't pass on something if it's a commercial. Take it. Work really does lead to other work. Especially if you're just starting out, work begets work.
- It's easier to get an actor when you just ask them to do a day on something rather than have them come in, audition, get picked.
- I have found that so many directors and producers in the room say nothing, and this can be deadly. It's very difficult to audition for comedy in the vacuum of a small room, but it's the only way most do it.
- Stand-ups are always good to see on YouTube. There's a guy named Mike Head who lives in Cleveland. He's great. He's an African-American stand-up.
- 'Arrested Development' is great; Mitch Hurwitz is great. Plus, it's the one show I've ever had where, on the small parts, he just let me cast people.
- The legwork is always hard. Really finding people that you think are good enough. Just the definition of what we have to do is finding good enough people that you really think are special.
