- Pressure does strange things to people. Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't have swapped anything. In many ways when the club was going through that period I was probably quite happy it was me, because I knew Rangers as well as anybody could have at that particular time.
- I could sit here and tell you about Walter Smith until the cows come home, about how good a manager, how good a coach and a football man he was.
- I've got mates who don't enjoy their work, but I would be sitting here talking about sport anyway.
- One of the reasons Old Firm supporters could relate to me was I was one of them, playing for the team I wanted to play for. If we scored at Celtic Park, the only people I wanted to celebrate in front of was Rangers supporters.
- I would never say I was one of the top players in the world, but I always felt on top of the world, that I would score every time I played.
- No one will ever convince me that I wasn't the best man for a goal if we needed one.
- I always looked across the tunnel in Old Firm games and fancied our chances but there's a big difference between that and knowing you're going to win. There's so many things can happen in an Old Firm game.
- I could go fishing with Paul Gascoigne, I could go for a pint and a game of doms with Ian Durrant. There's no way I would play now rather than the era I played in. We had a life.
- Celtic had some really good players. Paul McStay is one of the best I've ever played against.
- But if you are not going to a football club where your board will 100 per cent support you and help you then you have no chance. Or very little chance.
- The only picture I've got in my house - other than family photos, of course - is one of me with Muhammad Ali.
- I was as staunch a Rangers supporter as any wee boy could be without being bigoted. We did a lot of stupid things. We sang the songs, but with no real feeling, and didn't have a clue what we were singing about.
- Tommy Burns was a brilliant human being. One of the biggest compliments ever paid to me was that I was to Celtic supporters what Tommy was to Rangers supporters. You're not universally loved, far from it, but you are accepted.
- Losing a goal in the last minute? Important, of course it is, but not really in the grand scheme of things.
- I am not a pious character who never makes mistakes.
- I am the Rangers manager who ended up in a witness stand in the high court, thinking: 'Is this what it's come to?' There were people involved at our football club who had no right to be there and should never have been near the place.
- I really enjoy what I'm doing, I really enjoy my weekends watching football. I watch the kids play football and the Saturday before last I was at four games. Then I ended up watching La Liga on telly. On the Sunday I'm the same and I really enjoy it.
- During my time on 'Question of Sport', we had a lot of boxing greats - such as George Foreman, Marvin Hagler and Joe Calzaghe.
