- I am proud of being a bad loser. Bad losers are winners. That is the way it should be.

- I did GCSE's and A-levels. I did my finals after the Lions tour in 2009 to get my law degree. So I've always had an eye on life beyond playing, irrelevant of the period in my career.
- Players want to play a lot of rugby. We're walking contradictions at times in that we want to play a lot of rugby, but we don't want to play too much rugby, and we want to be available for all the big games, yet there are times when you have to sacrifice that because of game limits.
- Ultimately, rugby players are like surfers. You look for the perfect wave, but you don't always find it. And if you did, you'd probably pack up and try something else.

- I don't regret the way I approached things, because otherwise I wouldn't have achieved what I did, but when I look back, I could have enjoyed things more.
- As individuals, we don't sometimes let ourselves enjoy things that we possibly should because of ways you want to be perceived, which is a silly thing as well.

- If we have given everything we can, you are not settling for mediocrity because the better team won. Sometimes you have to have that mindset to be able to improve rather than keep telling yourself you should have won.

- It really gets my back up when people start using business phrases - 'sustainability,' 'the brand,' etc. - about rugby.

- I am competitive because it is fun, a mentality thing, and it is something you have to be in this job.
- I would like to think I am well aware of what the Lions are about and what they represent, but out of respect for your body and the players who are putting up their hands to be selected, you keep it at arm's length.
