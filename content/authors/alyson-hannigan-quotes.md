- This is what I always wanted to do in my entire life, so I am not going to sit here and complain that it is so terrible to be in successful movies, because it becomes a trilogy!
- I love that when I give my 4-year-old a cupcake, she takes a few licks of the frosting and takes a bite, but she has yet to finish a whole cupcake. She gets so excited about cake, but she never eats all of it. She would rather have a plate of fruit. I hope that sticks.
- Everything seems like, 'If I don't change this diaper correctly, she won't go to college.' My advice is, know that the time does go by fast... it's a huge roller coaster; it's the hardest thing and most rewarding thing.
- 'How I Met Your Mother' - I would do it again in a heartbeat. It was so much fun going to work every day... we laughed and laughed. It was just pure, lovely fun.

- There's a very wild side to me, but it's calming down.
- My mom, Emilie, always taught me to think hard about marriage.
- I never got back to being a vegan, but now I'm super healthy. Once Keeva turned a year old, I thought, 'I should probably try to lose this baby weight.' It didn't come off as easily the second time around... so I went to nutritionist and got on a good program that's been working really well.
- My mom was a photographer and whenever they needed a baby for a modelling job, she'd stick me in front of the camera. That's how it started.
- I've always just loved the Marshall/Lily relationship, and just exploring that, and the dynamic of a long-term relationship, and I just love our scenes together. I love it.
- I use foundation with sunscreen in it to save a step. It's just enough to look like I put makeup on. Then, I use a little blush, and that's it - I'm out the door.
- I know quickly whether a guy is boyfriend material. If I can have a good time doing absolutely nothing with him, then that's boyfriend material for me. Like if we're able to have fun at a gas station. I've had some really good times at gas stations.
- I love this profession, but God, it can just destroy people, and I don't want that to happen and become some monster.
- I went to a regular school, not one of those fame academy things.
- As a mom, I think you always wonder if you could be doing more.
- I want to stay true to who I am by trying to be in the moment.
- I've had a career where people still remember all these shows I've been on. It's quite cool; I just want to do stuff that people like.
- There should be a law that there's a pajama day every few weeks.
- When I got pregnant with my first child, I was vegan. And when I got pregnant, my body was craving meat so much. I started out slowly with eggs, then cheese, then I was like, 'OK, I need a steak!' I had to listen to my body - my cravings were so strong with the first one. When I got a craving for a food, I needed it five minutes ago.
- One of the most special moments was when my husband and I renewed our vows for our 10th anniversary. It was super small with just us, our girls, and a couple of the people we wanted to be there the most. It was so meaningful.
- You need to suffer to be interesting.
- No matter how much you love your spouse, you won't love them in the same way you do your baby. It's a different love, and everything changes. You have to figure out how to parent together.

- I don't mind being the funny character rather than the glamorous one, although I'm happy to do both.

- I don't like hospitals, and the idea of being in labor somewhere I don't like at all - wasn't how I wanted to bring my kids into the world.
- I definitely had to be talked into 'American Pie: Reunion.' I was hesitant because I'm on a show, and I felt, 'I'm happy. I've got my family.' But then I met the directors, who also wrote it, and once I read the script, I was like, 'OK, sign me up.'
- It's amazing what your body does to produce another human... you should thank your body for what it does.
