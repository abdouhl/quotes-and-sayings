- People wanted to be friends with me for not the right reasons. They'd introduce me to somebody else as the Olympian or the swimmer. I didn't want to stand out. I wanted to blend in.
- In swimming, everyone calls me grandma, because I'm the oldest there. Then with my friends, I'm the youngest and I'm the baby. It's definitely bizarre.
- With my sport, I am outside and in the water, which can be really drying and damaging to the skin, so I try to be vigilant about taking good care of it.
- To look good in the water you have to pick the right swimsuit. I own close to 500.
- I protect my skin with sunscreen and am religious about keeping my face moisturized and properly protected all day, so I also use a face lotion with SPF 30.
- I'd go to swim practice, put my face in the water, and I didn't have to talk to anybody. Swimming was like my escape, but it was also like this huge prison because I felt like I had to swim up to people's standards.
- The swimming community is really conservative. I don't know why, because we're in no clothing whatsoever.
- I always tell people, I'm a better swimmer because I'm a mom and a better mom because I'm swimmer.
- If you want me to swim fast, you have to let me enjoy my life.
- I concentrate on preparing to swim my race and let the other swimmers think about me, not me about them.
- Obviously, the competitor in you, you want to be in the top three every time in the pool.
- I know that I do deserve good things.
- When people say to me, 'You're like the Anna Kournikova who wins,' I definitely take it as a compliment, because she's quite gorgeous.
