- I don't want to be Marilyn Monroe. In many ways, that's a good comparison. Because Marilyn Monroe was a sexpot, all that stuff that I have no interest in. For me, it's much easier to just try to make people laugh than to try to be the hottest thing in the world.
- I think that in Hollywood, it's hard because so many people do turn out crazy. I don't need to go out every night to get attention. I'm happy with the amount that I have.
- I never wanted to be a model. I never wanted to be a serious actress. I started off doing comedy. I did a stand-up comedy camp at the Laugh Factory, and I started out on Nickelodeon.
- People have a preconceived notion about who I am and it's interesting. It's like picking who you want to win for the Oscars and not seeing the movie. Before you make a statement about someone, get all the information and see everything before you make a judgment.
- I'm so protected in my Nickelodeon bubble and 'What I Like About You.' It's all pretty much the same people I've worked with and it was pretty protected.
- Every person is so different and I don't think there is an exact match for every person. If you meet someone and they have 20 of the 25 things you want in a person, then you're pretty lucky.
- Some people still see me as a kid, but I'm a 23-year-old woman now.
- I loved 'Clueless.' That was one of my favorite movies of all time.

- I've grown up with kids watching me and as they're growing up, I'm growing up.
- I've never wanted to be the hottest star. I always wanted to do good movies.
- I feel like people start to believe things that people say about them and start to think they're really important. If you have a family that is down to earth and cool, I don't see how you can be like that.
- I get a script and it's really interesting with scripts, because you never really know. It's paper and it could be great or awful. Even scripts that are good could end up not working.
- I say I never wanna get married. I feel trapped with the idea of marriage. How can you really be with somebody forever? I'd get bored! As I get older, I don't settle. I'd rather tell somebody 'This is what I want - take it or leave it.'
- So many people comment that I'm much more mature than average. In this business, you can get taken advantage of if you're not aware and you're not tough.
- I wear Spanx to smooth things out. I read that Jessica Alba wears them and if she wears them, then so should I.
- It's really interesting with scripts, because you never really know. It's paper and it could be great or awful. Even scripts that are good could end up not working.
- I have actor friends, but they're not famous. I feel like if you're an actor or - famous, you have to overly prove that you're a normal, cool person.
- I don't know if there is someone for everyone. Every person is so different and I don't think there is an exact match for every person. If you meet someone and they have 20 of the 25 things you want in a person, then you're pretty lucky.
- When you're doing movies, you're traveling all over the world and you really can't be home.
- This is how memories are made... by going with the flow.
- Part of me relates to Perez Hilton because he's an outcast. I don't have a lot of friends who are actresses. They're catty, and they'll cut you down. I like that Perez is proud of who he is and doesn't care what anybody thinks.
- Going to another country you're not in your house, you're with people you've never met before, and I think it's definitely a good growing experience.
- I've worked really hard to get to where I am. Slow and steady wins the race, and I believe in paying your dues.
- I can't help but laugh at all of you writing fake stories about me. I was not in any hit and runs. I don't drink so the DUI is false.
- We try to magnify the difference between Americans and the English. In real life they like the same music and dress the same. It's really much more similar than anyone thinks or how we show it.
- I don't like being compared to anyone or being in a class with someone. I'm a teen actress and therefore I'm competing against Hilary Duff. We're different people like everyone else.
- Being an actress isn't as fun as it may seem. If I don't love something, I stop doing it. I don't love acting anymore, so I've stopped doing it.
