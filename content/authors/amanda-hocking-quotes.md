- I want to be a writer. I do not want to spend 40 hours a week handling e-mails, formatting covers, finding editors, etc.
- I think I draw most inspiration from writers like Richelle Mead and filmmakers like John Hughes. They both really understand the experience of being a teenager and how insistent and intense everything feels, but they're also smart, savvy, and fun.
- For me to be a billion-dollar author, I need to have people buying my books at Wal-Mart.
- When I was a little kid, before I learned how to write, I would tell stories.
- Travelling is a great time to catch up on my reading. It's hard falling asleep in new places, but a good book always makes it easier.
- I was always depressed growing up. There wasn't a reason for it, I just was. I was sad and morose. I cried a lot, I wrote a lot, and I read a lot; and that was how I dealt with it.
- People have bad things to say about publishers, but I think they still have services, and I want to see what they are. And if they end up not being any good, I don't have to keep using them.
- Self-publishing is great, but I don't want to be an icon for it, or anything else.
- I don't want to be famous per se, but I want to write books for as long as I can. And I plan on writing a lot.
- I don't really like fairies.
- I still have the same friends I've had for the last 15 or 20 years.
- It feels so weird to be able to just kind of buy things when I want them or need them.
- I've always kind of wrote when I wanted to. Once I get the idea in my head and get it outlined out, I usually just sit and write until it's done.
- I have a screened in porch, and it's nice to curl up with a book outside when it's raining, especially an old battered classic like 'Pride & Prejudice & Zombies.'
- Writing has always felt like a compulsion. Even at high school there'd be times when people would ask me if I wanted to go and hang out and I'd sit home and write instead.
- I priced my books at what I would want to spend on an electronic book.
- My mom has a tape from when I was, like, 2 years old, talking with my grandma, telling her a story that's really elaborate about werewolves and wolves.
- I usually plan to read a book for a half-hour before bed, but then I end up staying awake until 3 A.M. to finish it. Fortunately, my dog doesn't mind when I keep the bedside lamp on.
- I've taken every writing class I've had available. I took classes in high school, and I took English and writing classes in community college, but I dropped out of college. I also attended a local writing workshop two years ago.
