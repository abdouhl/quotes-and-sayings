- There aren't many roles that are interesting if you're a 40-year-old woman, unless you're Julia Roberts or Cate Blanchett.
- I try to be really hippie about things. I'm uptight in all the ways that are really important, but the things my husband and family can benefit from my uptightness, I'm completely lacking.
- I see a lot of homes that are supercool, and everything is very tasteful, but it's not warm. I'm really scared of rooms that look too serious.
