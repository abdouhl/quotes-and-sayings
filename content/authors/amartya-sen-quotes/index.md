- But the idea that I should be a teacher and a researcher of some sort did not vary over the years.
- I have not had any serious non-academic job.
- The student community of Presidency College was also politically most active.
- I left Delhi, in 1971, shortly after Collective Choice and Social Welfare was published in 1970.
- The curriculum of the school did not neglect India's cultural, analytical and scientific heritage, but was very involved also with the rest of the world.
- While I am interested both in economics and in philosophy, the union of my interests in the two fields far exceeds their intersection.
- It is also very engaging - and a delight - to go back to Bangladesh as often as I can, which is not only my old home, but also where some of my closest friends and collaborators live and work.
- When the Nobel award came my way, it also gave me an opportunity to do something immediate and practical about my old obsessions, including literacy, basic health care and gender equity, aimed specifically at India and Bangladesh.
