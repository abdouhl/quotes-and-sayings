- I used to have Lamborghinis, Ferraris parked up outside the house - just parked there with no one driving them! Now I'm much wiser, and I only have one car that I drive. What's the point of having three cars just parked up when you don't need them?

- If you start throwing eight or nine shots, you're going to get caught - bang - and the fight could be over.

- I want to thank Kotelnik for letting me have a shot at the title. I'm so confident I'm going to beat him. He thinks that me moving up a weight, I won't be as strong, but I'm very strong. I'm a hard-hitting fighter.

- I was very hyperactive when I was a kid, just misbehaving at school like most kids, and I would probably be 10 times worse at home.

- I want to retire from boxing by the time I am 25 or 26 and be a legend by that age.

- Of course I will turn professional at some stage. Then I want to be a world champion and finish up a legend and be out of the sport by the time I am 27.

- The good thing about being nervous is that you perform better.
- I'm very experienced in four-round fights because of my amateur career, and I've got a high work rate.

- Boxing's a business, and I've got a great team around me who have been looking after me in that sense.
- I'm confident I can take the gold in Beijing.
