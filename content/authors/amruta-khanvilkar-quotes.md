- I'm ecstatic: meeting Ranbir was like a dream come true for me, and to perform and be praised by him is like an icing on the cake. This memory, I would cherish for my entire life.
- I am closest to my mother, as she is my rock, my pillar of strength, and my world. Not only has she stood by me through all times - happy, sad, and otherwise - but there have even been moments when I had completely lost hope, and her immense belief in me had lifted me up.
- The Marathi film 'Natrang' has amazing songs. I also like and have sufi and folk music.
- Himanshu and I have known each other for over 13 years, and I don't have to prove anything to anyone. Why should I go gushy over my husband on social media when I would rather keep my love and feelings private?
- Am I blessed? That would be an understatement.
- I don't know why I am not offered woman-oriented films. Films like 'Satrangee Re' went house-full at some centres, but I didn't have much to do in the film. Everyone came up to me and said that I looked pretty but nothing beyond that.
- I have been a part of stage shows, but yes, I do get cold feet when I think that every move of mine will be under scrutiny!
- Though films have established me as an actor, dance has given me an identity and a boost to my career, and I am thankful to God for that.
- There are some women who have made some really hurting remarks about my relationship with my husband Himanshu Malhotra. They even dared to ask me if I have divorced him just because I don't put my pictures with him too often. Now that is really ridiculous!
- I don't know where things are going wrong. I refused 22 offers for lavani numbers and five films. I was not happy with the kind of offers coming my way. Even for the lavani number 'Vajale Ki Bara' in 'Natarang,' I was the last option. I was finalised one day before the shoot was to begin.
- I don't regret any of my decisions. But yes, I feel that I should have planned my career well in Bollywood. But then again, I did not have any guidance. There was no one to tell me the dos and don'ts.
- I had never really planned that I will host reality shows. I just took up some offers that came my way. But reality shows are a good platform to showcase talent. They help one become a household name in a matter of few days.
- I like doing Marathi films. I am not too keen on Hindi TV shows. It's very tough to get Hindi films, but if a good script and role comes up in future, I will surely pick it up.
- While I was doing Hindi, people there laughed at me because I couldn't speak Hindi and English properly.
- As a couple, we mutually decided to stay away from it, and rather than spending time on Internet, we be with each other. And if I need to tell Himanshu anything, I would rather whisper it in his ears than on social media. He is, after all, just beside me.
- We want to grow old together, and even when we won't have fame, success, fans, we know we will still be sticking to each other.
- I am proud of the fact that people consider me a style icon.
- I would have loved to play Arjun Rampal's role in 'Rock On!'
- The real challenge lies in maintaining dignity while being funny. I am in awe of Krushna Abhishek's energy and Bharti Singh's wit. They are infectious and selfless.
- I always wanted to do theatre but never really took it up, as I was more inclined towards dance and films.
- Some commercials can work against your image.
- When 'Pune-52' was offered to me, I liked the script, but I wasn't convinced about the kissing and other intimate scenes. I tried talking to the director, but things didn't work out.
- We have seen the most difficult times and were there to back each other. We have struggled, seen career highs and lows, and know we will be there for each other forever. We have together build our relationship strong. Himanshu is my biggest investment, and I can't let him go.
- Sometimes I am moody or bubbly, and then at other times, I just want to disconnect. I am an extreme person.
- My emotions are usually my weakness, but they are my strength while acting.
- Things work very differently in Bollywood. There is a lot of camping there.
- I love kids a lot. I love to spend time with them. They give me the energy to live, and I would love to bring a smile on their faces.
- I would not call Himmanshoo a good husband, but I would call him my best friend and a great companion. Personally, my mom and my family say that I am very lucky to have Himmanshoo as my partner. And I don't disagree at all. Marriage has been great!
- I want to prove to my fans that I am beyond candy floss roles and item numbers.
- As Maharashtrian actors, we are very conscious about our decisions in Bollywood. It's not cakewalk. Bollywood is vast, and there is a lot of competition. I don't want to be doing something small there.
- Moving to Mumbai was difficult, as survival was a major concern. I was not from a very well-to-do family.
- Even if actors ask for more money, will producers fulfill their demands? They might just show us the door.
- I entered this glam world by luck. I wanted to join dancing classes since I was a child, but my parents never gave me the permission to do so, as no one in our family had ever chosen this path. Fortunately, I got my first break in a reality show easily due to my dance skills, so that way I have been lucky.
- Commercials certainly pay more than films. I was pleasantly surprised at the profitability of commercials when I did my first ad for a popular soap brand years ago. I was paid a huge amount of money for a mere 30 seconds of screen presence. After that, ads have been a regular feature in my career.
- I love Meghna Gulzar's film making and her style of story telling. In her films, every character, small or big, is beautifully etched.
- I thought that losing weight by following a strict diet will make me more flexible and feel more confident about my body. I have become so used to the routine now and have fallen in love with my body that I would want to follow it forever.
- 'Nach Baliye' has always been one of my favourite shows on television. I always used to be an avid follower of the show, and I always wanted to be a part of this show and am quite excited to be part of it.
- For me, fashion is all about comfort. I know people say such cliche things all the time, but at the end of the day, you should wear what looks good on you.
- For me, the one relationship in my life that I cherish the most has to be the one I share with my parents, especially my mother.
- Be it TV, films, or stage, I love substantial roles. The length of the character doesn't matter, but if the character is well thought, then I have to grab it.
- My parents always used to ask me to settle down, and I could never understand that term. However, after marriage, I have finally realised the importance of having a companion.
- I am very uncomfortable being romantic. I can be funny; I can be all over the place. I can be anything but romantic.
- I am someone who doesn't say no to opportunities and, thus, would be happy to do something interesting on television.
- With Marathi cinema, content is king. It has always been driven by content. I am lucky that I don't have to leave home to seek a job elsewhere. The industry is here at home.
- Marriage has changed Himmanshoo in some ways. Throughout our 10 years of courtship, he was more liberal. But after marriage, he has become a typical Indian husband.
- I have never hesitated to work hard and always try and give my best in whatever I am doing.
- I have always admired Meghna Gulzar's work, and getting to work with her and the Dharma Productions is like a dream come true.
- We have grown a lot as a couple. 'Nach Baliye' has made us understand each other in a way that now there is nothing missing in our relationship. We know each other fully.
- You have to take all the ups and downs that come your way like a pinch of salt. Just leave everything behind. Forgive and forget.
- I was born in Mumbai. We stayed in a joint family. But in 1994, my father had to shift to Pune for business. I started working at a very early stage. Immediately after my SSC board examination, I took up odd jobs in shops, as I wanted to contribute to my family.
- Himanshu and I travel together whenever possible, but there are times when I like to travel with my mother and maasi. It is really shocking that trolls comment on that, too. They say 'Don't you get along with your mother-in-law that you don't take her along?' Now, who would accept such remarks about one's mother?
