- I was always like that, at 5 years old, just demanding equality. I thought it could all be fixed if you called attention to it.
- I want people to live to their full potential, not to hold themselves back because of insecurities, and especially not women. I see too much of that.
- My background is in theater. I was a theater major in college.
- What's good about not being a model is that it's not the thing I trade on. Once I start looking older, that won't affect me. I have never gotten anything done because I'm, like, so gorgeous. I'm good-looking enough that I can work in the business.

- I've always been really dark, and drawn to darker humor. Nothing has been forced, and I don't say anything for shock value.
- I've always had my wrist slapped for being myself.
- It's not hard for me to be funny. But it's really hard. I don't think a lot of people are funny. I meet a lot of people, and most of them aren't funny.
- I just say what I think is the funniest thing I could say. I'm not trying to make headlines. I'm just trying to say the stuff that I think is funny and will make people laugh.
- I think you can go from being not very funny to working really hard for 10 years and figuring out how to make a living on the road, but I don't think you can rise much above that.
- Happiness can't start with external stuff, whether that's money or success or your body.

- To be really great, you need to be naturally funny in order to stand out. But you can work at it, and find the best vehicle that you have to communicate what you're saying to people.
- I think of myself as a fairly attractive girl and always have, thanks to my mom. I was brought into this world thinking I was gorgeous because my mother was extremely devoted to this notion.
- I just have this sense of entitlement that I should be able to feel comfortable at all times, like I could go to bed at any moment in what I'm wearing.

- I like people who are predictable.
- My regimen is I wake up, usually around 8:30, brush my teeth, and splash water on my face.
- I have a healthy relationship with food. My problem is, as a comic, I eat dinner late. But I'll have a smoothie for breakfast every morning, and I keep it pretty low-carb and healthy during the day. At night, I'll have a basic protein, quinoa, and vegetables.
- A big part of becoming a funny person was a major defense mechanism. Onstage, especially as a woman, I've had to be really tough. The second you show a crack, the audience can literally leave.

- I am very into making up my own rules.
- Some men's magazines are just downright offensive.
- People get really turned off by feminism.
- I'm super grateful that there wasn't social media when I was a kid, but that sort of self-doubt crept in at a young age. It's bullying. It's the comments here and there, and maybe somebody says something to you that they don't even mean to be a mean-spirited comment, but they'll just kind of say it to you in passing.
- I like to create stuff. I like to express myself through jokes.
- I love watching TV.
- I'm insanely close to my sister.
