- I grew up where my parents would literally shove me in the car rather than have to say hello to a neighbor.

- I like a certain style of show, I like a certain pace, I like a rhythm, I like a lot of comedy in with my drama.
- Well, I took ballet for many, many years, so my whole childhood really revolved around dance class. I grew up around dance; my mother was a dancer.
- The dance world was a big part of my growing up.
- Well, I have no time for therapy.
- I don't go on the Internet. I never go on the Internet. I don't go on Twitter. I'm not on Facebook. I've seen friends go into dark, dark holes of sadness because of that. Frankly, I don't have the time or the attention span for it.
- No one in my writers' room can wear sweatpants.

- I think every writer has got to direct. If you don't direct, you can't protect your work. The only way to ensure that it's going to be as close as possible to what you put down on paper - and what you see and hear in your head - is to do it yourself.
- Families can be the most detrimental things to have in your life. They are sometimes the most poisonous relationships that people have. Sometimes family is the thing that keeps you from ever achieving what you want to achieve, and yet people hold it and hold it and grab it and try to fix it and twist it and turn it.
- With a sitcom, everyday you do a run through, and people are judging you, and the scripts are being changed nightly, nightly, nightly.
- I think I would be making a mistake to actively try and just do everything completely different from 'Gilmore Girls.'
- If we based everything in Hollywood on who was a nice guy, holy moly, we would have no movies. No actors would work. This is not an industry that is ruled by kindness and generosity.
- I think music on television is just uniformly dreadful. It is mundane, it says nothing.
- As a writer, all you want to do is write for great actors. That's all.
