- I mean, I'm married to an academic oncologist, a cancer doctor, okay? He and his colleagues are some of the most conscientious, devoted, hard-working, conventional bourgeois people in the known universe. They are the people that keep this society going.
- Jews have been harmed by the threats to freedom of opinion and debate, the punishments for candor, and the decline in rigorous standards in the academy that have accompanied progressive hegemony, which insists upon the sacrosanct status of affirmative action and other policies favored by the left.
- You know, people come from cultures all around the world. Many of those cultures, you know, are not terribly successful. You can tell because you go to the countries and they're doing really poorly, and a lot of why they're doing poorly is because of the outlook, mind-set, and behavior of the people.
- Blacks as a group will never be equal while they have this situation going on, where the vast majority of children do not have fathers in the home married to their mother, involved in their lives, investing in them, investing in the next generation.
- A lot of the problems we have in our criminal-justice system, you know, the problem of over-incarceration, the problem of prosecutorial abuse, the problem of just this sort of mass crop of people, of plea bargains, they all have to do with the system being overloaded. If crime was lower, many of the problems would go away.
- Europe and the first world to which the United States belongs remain mostly white for now, and the third world, although mixed, contains a lot of nonwhite people.
- If you are accused of racism, to deny racism is proof of racism.
- Many, indeed most, inhabitants of the Third World, don't necessarily share our ideas and beliefs; others pay lip service, but don't really comprehend them. There are exceptions of course, but most people are not exceptional.

- One of my pet peeves, one of my obsessions, is litter.
- Women, on average, are less knowledgeable than men. They're less intellectual than men.
- I believe the conservatives need to push back against the ungrateful habit of blaming the West by pointing repeatedly to the self-inflicted wounds of the Third World.
- I do sort of question the notion that conservatives should try and turn America into a place where people can come from traditional societies and continue to be fully traditional in every sense.
- Take corruption, right? Take political corruption. Europe, the Anglosphere, northern Europe, has been kind of a miracle zone - and I'm not saying there's no corruption, of course - but in being somehow able to minimize political corruption.
- My position here is that conservatives need a realistic approach to immigration that best serves and preserves our country's status and identity as a relatively high-functioning, at least for now, Western and First World nation. That status will not automatically maintain itself. It is fragile. It is precarious and vulnerable to erosion.

- Although it was common in our culture to complain a lot - about friends, relatives, business partners, bad luck, and the general cluelessness of non-Jews - we were not permitted to complain that anti-Semitism and discrimination were standing in our way.
