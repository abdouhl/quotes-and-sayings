- Everybody has their own style.
- We can help families buy their homes and invest in their educations.
- We need the banks to be attractive to investors again.
- I don't think of us as defending ourselves. I think of us as a challenger, an attacker.
- We are a challenger bank; let me say that once, twice, and three times if necessary because people still sometimes think of us as being very big.
- I get the sense that the British do not like to look at things on the bright side of life. Maybe it has something to do with the weather.
- We didn't invent gunpowder. What we did was take things that were there and put them together in a way that works.
- I think cash will be around for a long time.
- I am confident that our experience, our scale, our intimate knowledge of the needs of our customers put us on the front line of economic and social progress.
- Bright graduates will either set up their own companies or come and work for us or a consulting firm or government. But going to work for a small company if you are really good? No way.

- We need to change how we run banks. We need to change the culture. If we get it right, we can have a huge impact.
- We are going to make people who do some things with Santander into loyal customers who bank with us every day. This is what will allow us to compete in a world where banking customers have more and more choice. If we don't do this, then we won't grow in the next decade.
- Discretion is the most important thing for a banker. That is the philosophy of the family... I mean, of the bank.
- I didn't join a bank because my father worked in a bank or because I thought I was going to be a banker or because I thought I was going to be where I am today.
- I started at the bottom. Nobody has given me anything.
- I have a very, very difficult job.
- I'm confident in our team and our capacity to continue to deliver.
- Being different is critical.
- We are the most British of Britain's banks. This always gets a chuckle; I don't why.

- Profit, wealth creation, competition - these are not dirty words but the lifeblood of a dynamic economy.
- For me, my husband gives me advice all the time - he's been very supportive.

- We need to stop frowning upon failure whilst criticising those that succeed.
- It's true that I'm always happy to walk away.

- It has to be convenient. You have to be able to bank with me anytime.
- We're a boring retail and commercial bank.
- We can support innovators and entrepreneurs.
- I would love it if you became a Santander customer.
