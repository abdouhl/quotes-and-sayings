- A lot of stuff people said to me when I was younger subconsciously stayed with me and became my biggest insecurities.

- In 'SOTY2,' I played a character which was my age, a lot like how I am as a person.

- I don't like to wear much makeup when I'm off-duty, so I usually just swipe on my Lakme lip balm, wear a little mascara and I'm ready to head out the door.

- I can't ever deal with a boyfriend or husband like Chintu Tyagi. I'm a very loyal and I expect the same.
- People who troll are people who need love the most. They namelessly, facelessly bully people because they've probably never been loved. So it's even more important to show these people the amount of love you're capable of.

- There are so many examples of such talented people who have not come from the film background like Ranveer Singh and Anushka Sharma and then there are actors like Ranbir Kapoor and Alia Bhatt who have come from film families and done so well. So, it all comes down to the audience.
- I know I am an actor and whatever I say people are going to get influenced by that.
