- If I go anywhere else and win a championship, it's not going to be the same. I want to win a championship in Cleveland. That's where I want to stay. I love Cleveland.
- I have seen players and coaches come and go, but through it all, I have always known Cleveland is where I want to retire. But life doesn't always work the way you want it to, and at the end of the day, the saying, 'This is a business,' is unfortunately true.
- There is nothing like walking on the streets on a freezing cold day and hearing fans scream your name, then stopping to talk to those same fans. There is nothing like looking into the crowd at the Q and seeing over 20,000 people wearing wigs to match your hair. Those are feelings I will cherish for the rest of my life and never forget.
- I just think about cutting my hair when it's too hot or when I have to go somewhere that I have to wash it and style it. That's when I think about cutting it.
- Although it was hard to be traded, I have no hard feelings. I'm grateful to Dan Gilbert and the Cavs organization for 12 amazing years. I know I'm very fortunate. I'm leaving one great team and joining another. I can't wait to put on my new Warrior jersey.
- Coming over from Spain at the young age of 21 was not easy, but as soon as I put on a Cavs jersey and stepped on the court, I felt at home.
- Home is where the heart is, and my heart will forever be in Cleveland.
- You're going to play good. You're going to play bad. But as long as I stay healthy, I should be happy. Every player should feel the same way.
- You never know how much you can do in practice because you never know if you're going to play or not, but the main thing is stay ready.
