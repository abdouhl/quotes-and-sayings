- I miss everything, fighting here, the friends, my family and the food, but I knew that to succeed and fulfill my dreams I needed to leave Mexico.
- Most of the advice I have received revolves around taking advantage of all the Performance Center has to offer and always giving my best, so I have no regrets.
- The WWE Performance Center is absolutely magnificent and like nothing I have ever seen or trained at before.
- I'm focused on my work.
- Sometimes It's hard when you come from Mexico, because it's a different style, but I had the advantage of my tours to Japan, and with that experience I was able to understand what WWE want from me.
- I was trained by 'El Satanico' and Franco Colombo.
- Wrestling is in my blood and is who I am.
- I have this connection, but I want my story, my legacy, not the same as Eddie Guerrero, not the same as Rey Mysterio, different.
- I really enjoy everything about this profession. From the training I do preparing for my matches, to the time I spend in the dressing room getting ready, right up until I make my entrance to the ring and the final bell rings.
- I'm working for my legacy.
- It looks strong to win the title, no?
- Although I do a lot of aerial moves, I use many strong style moves.
- Over time, with my matches, I convinced both the fans and the coaches that my style was the best for me, and they understood who I am, and that is who I am today.
- WWE is always searching for new talent all over the world.
- As I say, there are many coaches in the Performance Center, and some like one thing, others like another. When I arrived I wrestled strong style, but they wanted me to do more of Mexican wrestling, like headscissors, planchas, dives outside the ring.
- The WWE is a company that's in the world. There are many languages. There's India, there's Spanish, Japanese, Chinese, many languages.
- The hardest thing for me was probably the different roles in the Performance Center because when you go to the Performance Center and become a WWE Superstar, you're on a different schedule. But in the indies or in Mexico, you have your time.
- Wrestling is my passion and what I love.
- I love Ric Flair. He's a great person with me, he talks, texts me, sometimes we have dinner.
- I was fortunate enough to have a great career with CMLL, which played a large role in helping me get noticed by WWE.
- The generally big places in the world, the big countries for pro wrestling or lucha libre are Mexico, U.S.A., Japan, and U.K. And now WWE is in all countries and it's different.
- I like the style I have: I do Mexican wrestling things, I have strong moves, I look strong above the ring; a bit of everything.
- I won a title versus Rey Mysterio, it's incredible.
- I don't like schedules.
- I feel that I have had great matches with Rey Mysterio, AJ Styles, Daniel Bryan, Seth Rollins.
- Sometimes when Zelina is injured or something, sometimes when I go to the ring and Zelina's not in my corner, something is confused or like I forgot something.
