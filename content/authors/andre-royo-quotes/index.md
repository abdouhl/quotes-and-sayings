- I've always loved Don Cheadle and Jeffery Wright and even Sam Jackson.
- I am a little bit of an egomaniac. I like being in front of the camera, so I take advantage of it when I can.
- I started in the theater world in New York City - and indie films - and I love the feeling of your head coming together and trying to tell a simple story, a small story, and just getting that vibe of storytelling without all the craziness of big budget.
- I feel like I get drawn to - and I know it sounds cheesy but - I love storytelling.
