- Growing up, I didn't think it would be possible to be an actress - I didn't see a lot of Latina faces on TV or in movies. But that didn't stop me from trying. I realized early that anything I really wanted was worth working for.
- The most important thing you can do for yourself is get an education. Learn, listen, and respond. You have to study and practice to get better at your craft and to widen your skill set.
- I'm really Americanized. The only real Latina thing I do is cook rice and beans with chuletas and tostones.

- I really needed a show like 'Jane' when I was growing up, so being able to portray a positive Latina character means a lot to me because I feel like it's helping me to contribute to someone's dreams.
- In real life, we think people don't change, but they do. People do change in profound ways with all the different major things that happen in their lives.
- It's really easy to give in to, 'I want to raise my kids,' 'I want to be the best mom, so I have to give up my dreams.' I don't believe that. I think, if anything, being a living example to your children is beautiful.
- My dad was in my life, and he was actually a very positive influence on me in my life. He was always there. He was a great dad. But my parents divorced when I was 5, so I grew up in a single-parent home.
- When I was in Mexico and started to dream in Spanish, I knew that was a good sign that I was learning the language. It was cool.
- There's so much humor in serious things sometimes.
- Latinos come from different countries, and they tend to segregate with only their country instead of embracing all the other countries, because in reality, all the Latinos are going through the same experiences of discrimination and racism.

- The black community sees itself as one group, and they are all experiencing the same experiences as a group with racism and whatnot, growing up in this country.
- I have to stop and think about everything I do. I'm very calculated in a lot of ways.
- My mom struggled for a long time growing up poor, and then we were on welfare when I was a kid. So to see her kids, not just me, be successful and making money and happy and healthy and in good relationships - it means so much to her after all that she's been through.
- My grandmother is bilingual, but she preferred to speak Spanish at home, so she would speak to us in Spanish, and everyone responded in English, sort of like what happens on 'Jane.'
- I've seen other actresses refuse to be ugly. Even if the story line calls for it or the character calls for it, they just can't go there for vanity's sake, and they don't want to be perceived in an ugly way. I was like, 'Nah, I wanna go for this.'
