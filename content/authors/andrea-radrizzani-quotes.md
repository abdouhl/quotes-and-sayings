- I love challenges in my life and I love to turn around organisations.
- There is hope to catch up, as long as Leeds get to the Premier League. I feel with a project an idea and people of quality we can close the gap on clubs with a different budget.
- I think the model of the Championship should be reconsidered, because the turnover of owners, keep changing all the time every one, two, three years, is not really healthy system for the fans, for the clubs - this is because it is really not sustainable to stay in the Championship.
- So I think it's like the night before the exam. Obviously, you stress. But when you have done your job well, then you need to go down, relax and enjoy.
- A club like ours loses £8-10m every year to be competitive, and nobody wants to keep a business that is losing money every year.
- Initially when I was looking to enter football I was looking at clubs in Italy or France or Spain, a mid-table club where I could develop players and eventually sell them.
- We should concede that a club like Leeds that is watched by 500,00 to 600,000 people live on Sky, getting from the league only £2m to 2.5m and are actually penalised because we are more than 20 times on TV.
- Try to imagine if all the Premier League games were now available, easily accessed by match or by season or by team via Amazon or Netflix. The audience could be much bigger. The single price per client could be lower; the total amount would still be bigger.
- For me pressure is positive. The players need to know they need to deliver results because we have massive support but we also need time because Rome was not built in a day.
- In the last 18 months, we received much interest from parties to invest in the club or buy the club. I rejected all the options to buy the club because I did not want to give up.
- Health comes before everything else and football can wait.
- For Leeds, we have a history of being 'dirty Leeds' and we actually channel that. We want to play great football and we are doing that but we also need to fight every time we go on to the pitch.
- Leeds United is one of England's greatest and most well-supported clubs with a rich history known all over the world.
- I had opportunities in other countries - I never thought about England and Leeds United.
- As a model, I look at clubs like Brighton and the success they've achieved gradually on a sustainable budget. I want to take a similar approach.
- We have been out of the top-flight for 16 years and I am thrilled for the whole club and our incredible fans that we are back in the Premier League.
- When you have done your job well at the training ground, when you know your player is following you, there is no reason to stress the match day.
- All of our boys are willing to fight for the shirt every week and having that character is important to being a Leeds United player.
- I hear a lot of rumours about me selling the club or leaving, absolutely no way.
- Those who know me well know how much I am determined to reach my goals. I really want to get it done and I want to achieve my goals in everything I do.
- Football means little without the presence of fans.
- If we look at Sky, the clientele and subscription, I think you see the consumer is tired of paying for a bundle. To pay £70 for 200 channels when maybe they just want to watch sports or football, and maybe some movies or TV series.
- I want to help Leeds United return to the level our history and fans deserve. When I came to the club, I gave myself three years to deliver that and my vision remains the same: return the club to its rightful place in the Premier League and make our fans, players and staff proud of their football team.
