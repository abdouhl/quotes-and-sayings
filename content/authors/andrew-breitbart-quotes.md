- I'm not a huge fan of Bruce Springsteen, and it's certainly not because of his politics. I just don't like the aesthetic.
- The downside to the Whole Foods experience is that its success is driven by one of our era's more grotesque phenomena: the upwardly-mobile urban dweller, the one who wants to indulge class-conscious epicurean yearnings and save the world, too.

- You really have to do something Bruce Banner-like to me to cause me to go into my righteous indignation mode.
- Exposed in the relentless Palin attacks is not just political bias but unmitigated class bias. The American mainstream media in its current free-fall is begging for more comeuppance when it continues to berate the values and lifestyles of the folks in flyover country who, in simpler times, used to be considered valued customers.
- It would be my goal for Palin to become Oprah and be the ultimate kingmaker for twenty-odd years.

- For free-speech principles to be reinforced and free-market ideas to win the day, more people are going to have to stand up and be heard.
- Much of America rooted for Mr. Obama simply because he is black.
- It may be a task that's so Herculean, but I think it's a worthy goal to try to open up America to individuals who just so happen to have a different skin color, that they have every right and every freedom to think what they want to think.
- Celebrities like to pay lip service to causes but rarely do so by putting their lives in peril. And even more rarely do they do so in the name of the United States of America, not on their own behalf.
- The real hate crime these days is the Orwellian intimidation wielded by the Left against those that don't think the way they do. It's worse than waterboarding.
- I am the political psychiatrist to the stars.
- George W. Bush is history's president, a man for whom the long-term success or failure of democracy in Iraq will determine his place in history.

- My ability to be emotive and cry... I think I'm so fearful of tapping that that I won't know how to turn it off.
- My long-held fear is that Mr. Obama is hiding something about his education. During the endless 2008 campaign, Mr. Obama would not release his college grades. Given that President George W. Bush and Sens. Al Gore and John Kerry all had proved mediocre grades were no impediment to a presidential bid, Mr. Obama likely had other concerns.
- I'm not up for changing the Tenth Amendment or the Fourteenth Amendment, the First Amendment or the Second Amendment.
- While I have no desire to see Mr. Obama's birth certificate, I do want to see his college transcripts.
- I have dreams that I will reach balance in my life, and, at forty-one, I have none.
- Media is everything. It's everything.
- Much of Mr. Bush's 28 percent approval rating is born not of 'failed policies' - of which there are many - but of the ill-gotten gains pilfered from a pre-Bush inauguration strategy to send the message to Republicans that the Democrats play politics harder and better.
- Different identity groups hold specific levels of power over others when their battles play out in the media. To wit: Black beats white. Gay beats white. Black beats gay.

- I love fighting for what I believe in. I love having fun while doing it.
- The making of the Barack Obama franchise far exceeded the skill set of Washington's best. In fact, the recipe for Mr. Obama's global popularity can be attributed less to political minds and chance than to the enduring power of Hollywood.
- What's in your closet, John Podesta?
- Just because I am paying attention to politics and culture doesn't mean that I should be talking about the health-care bill, talking about the minutiae.
- They want to portray me as crazy, unhinged, unbalanced. OK, good, fine.
- I am not as partisan as people think I am.

- Mrs. Palin has neither pushed for creationism in Alaska schools nor moved to ban a single book in Wasilla.
- From its skillful editing to its out-of-control budget and its relentless marketing, Mr. Obama's team played a different game at a different level than Sen. John McCain and his traditionalist staff.
- I love fighting back. I love finding allies, and - famously - I enjoy making enemies.
- It was go-along to get-along social. It was living in Los Angeles, being young and single, and flowing with the trendy liberal crowd.
- Tea Party attendees and health care town-hall protesters share the common belief that the extravagant spending of President Obama and the Democratic Party - absent any checks and balances - will eventually lead more people into government dependency, higher taxes, and, perhaps, our country's financial ruin.
- The Democratic Media Complex, in its pursuit of Orwellian hate-crime legislation, reparations, and sundry non-ameliorative resolutions to America's troubled racial past, pursues its victims with blood lust.

- Much of America is petrified to bring up race, especially in public forums - the media, in particular.
- There isn't a day when I don't look in the mirror and think, 'How in the hell did I become a conservative Republican?' It's still a weird reckoning, because it shouldn't have happened.
- Mrs. Palin is history in a dress. And her script is straight out of Hollywood - like those teen movies with the cliched ending featuring the female valedictorian delivering the speech of a lifetime projecting a bold and transformative future with an independent-minded woman in charge.
- Our country was not built to support blood dynasties or to elevate the rich and famous to a higher ethical or constitutional plain.
- I didn't come up through the ranks of the conservative movement... I came to these revelations about my own personal politics in a realm in which those books, those ideas, the canon of conservatism, is nonexistent.
- In the public eye, being a victim of past injustices does not win the right to propagate current and future ones, and that's intolerable to those in charge of the race industry today, whose power relies on maintaining forever a latent rage that can be turned on and off at the will of the nation's elites.
- Primarily motivated by a desire to keep abortion 'safe, legal and rare,' female liberals in the media have carte blanche to do and say anything.
- I've lost friends, perhaps dozens. But I've gained hundreds, thousands - who knows? - of allies.
- We just assumed that Walter Cronkite was unbiased. In hindsight, it is clear that Walter Cronkite was biased and that he used feigned objectivity as the cudgel to change the American narrative from being a right of center one to being a left of center one.
- I'm sick of seeing my face on television.
- The thematically related 'Boys Don't Cry' and 'Brokeback Mountain' reinforced the narrative that gays like Mr. Shepard are regularly isolated for cruel and unusual attacks.

- Political correctness - the rigging of politics using different rules for different groups, and buttressed by the media - ensures that Democrats always have the upper hand.

- In a media instant, Sarah Palin went from an unknown moose hunter to a mass phenomenon on the precipice of becoming the vice president of the United States.
- The center-right alternative media has been playing a passable prevent defense, constantly saying 'That's not right' for consistently biased reporting.
- The sad fact is that actual artistic oppression - book banning in its many modern forms - is a matter of course in the entertainment industry, especially when the underlying product is declared politically incorrect or runs contrary to the interests of Hollywood's political altar, the Democratic Party.
- Women want to get to know Sarah Palin. And they want to meet her family.
- Liberalism has never been about establishing a universal standard. Liberalism is simply intellectual cover for those wanting to gain political power and increase the size of the state.
- I deal with gay and black conservatives who don't want to be called Uncle Toms of their politically correct Marxist multi-cultural unit structure. And they come to me saying, 'What can I do?' And I say, 'Lay low.'
- On college campuses, in newsrooms, and now in the highest corridors of power, with Barack Obama in the Oval Office, the politically correct Left is wielding its weaponry with the confidence that it can take down any group, anyone, or anything.
- Perhaps resigning from her first term in office may hurt Mrs. Palin's attempts to run for higher office. Even I, a Palin supporter, now have qualms about her seeking higher office.
