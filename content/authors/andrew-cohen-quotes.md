- We really have to be willing to find out who we are instead of rebelling for the equal rights that we've been denied, that we do deserve.
- Our relationship to reality and to our experience is all based upon the ideas in our mind that we're always trying to live up to.
- Our true nature is free of any and all notions of gender, of any notions of difference whatsoever.

- I'm not convinced that what are traditionally considered to be male energies or qualities or female energies or qualities really have as much to do with gender as many people think they do.
- When a human being becomes so still that they begin to lose awareness of their gender, and they are simply looking into that abyss where there is no notion of self whatsoever, the world disappears. And that's really the only place to go. It's the only place to remain.
- The excitement that you were feeling about a special, unique path for yourself as a woman is all part of your identification with and attachment to being female. And that's ultimately all ego.

- Almost all the ideas we have about being a man or being a woman are so burdened with pain, anxiety, fear and self-doubt. For many of us, the confusion around this question is excruciating.
- I am already inherently full and complete as I am. Man doesn't need woman and woman doesn't need man in order to experience his or her inherent fullness.
- I'm suspicious of any man or woman who approaches their own liberation with any kind of gender bias.
- It is not enough to be well-intentioned; one must strive to put those intentions into action in a capable way. One must consider the effect his actions will have on others. Looked at like this, to persist in ignorance is itself dishonorable.
- Hopefully, America will really get a sense of how justice can be served in this country. And hopefully, they'll forget the Simpson trial.
