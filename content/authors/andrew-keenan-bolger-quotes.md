- Knowing at the end of the day you get to go home and you can work on your own project is super rewarding as an actor.
- I feel like 2012 was the first year I actually felt like a grown-up.
- I think the advent of things like YouTube have made it possible for creators to tell stories cheaply and efficiently and to have a built-in audience.
- I'm interested in the film world; I love being a storyteller.
- I have seen the movie 'Showgirls' over 25 times.
- Live theater is an amorphous art, constantly shifting and evolving with every performance.
- I've gotten to work with people like Kristin Chenoweth and Chita Rivera... Seeing their process is so interesting. Seeing that these people aren't immortal - that they go through the same motions as we do and ask for feedback and break down scenes... They have to work, too, and that's really exciting to see.
- I think there's so much that is out of our control as actors, and it's just really hard to market yourself in such a huge industry.
- I think what's universal is the idea of auditioning. It's something that you do in every kind of job market. You audition every time you go on a date, you audition at a job interview, and it's always about trying to put the best version of yourself forward and seeing what sticks and what doesn't.
- Seeing other people perform inspires me. I couldn't be a good performer if just relied on my own talents. Seeing what other brave choices other actors are making gives me the strength to be bold in auditions and to approach roles in different kind of ways.
- I think that much of the success of the Broadway mounting of 'Newsies' was due in no small part to the infectious camaraderie on stage between the boys.
- When you're an actor, there are so many opportunities that are not in your control.
- I think anytime there's a big show on a network, people are also looking for what's the indie, stepchild version of this, the real DIY version?
- The 'Newsies' fans are a whole different breed.
- I think it's really important, as an actor in this business, to have another creative outlet.
- No live performance can ever be perfect, and that's what keeps you on your toes - it pushes you to practice harder, show up for that 8 A.M. ballet class, and walk through the stage door every night just to have the chance to do it all again.
- I always get nervous. It's usually a good thing. I worry about the nights that I'm not nervous, actually.
- Tony night was probably the highlight of my time with 'Newsies' - heck, of my life for that matter!
- Every actor dreams of getting a second chance to reprise a role.
- I think there's a weird stigma in the TV-film world that theater people can't be funny and understand subtlety, and I think that could not be more wrong.
- If my 12-year-old self knew that there was going to be a Broadway adaptation of 'Newsies,' I would have freaked out.
- As a kid, I was obsessed with Broadway cast recordings, and I would totally mimic and memorize every little choice that these actors made.
- My sister is my biggest Broadway hero.
- I think one of the traps of theater - what makes it so amazing is that it's not able to be mass-produced, but it also makes it hard to get work seen by people because if you're a creator, you do a cabaret or something, and maybe 100 people will see it and then it ends the night that you close it.
- I know everyone claims that their cast is 'really close,' but I think the bond we share in 'Newsies' is unique. In the show, these boys risk everything in the name of brotherhood, and I feel that same way about the guys in my cast.
- When you're reinterpreting the same material eight shows a week, it's impossible to lock in the 'ideal' performance. Things that felt great in previews can feel forced three months in; jokes that got big laughs in the rehearsal room may suddenly fall flat in front of a paying audience.
- People are not just going to bars and meeting people; they're connecting through social media.
- People have not given children enough credit to understand the idea of death. But I really think they do.
- You can't have living without dying.
- 'Kris Kringle' is a holiday musical for a new generation - a gorgeous score paired with a heartwarming tale of family and forgiveness.
- I tried to live my life really openly and transparently right from the get-go. I think that probably resonated with people.
- YouTube came out when I was a sophomore in college, and I feel like I was one of the first people to put musical theater stuff online.
- I was on Twitter right in the first couple months that it was out.
- I think, being an actor, part of it is also being a teacher. I think that's one of the most rewarding things you can do - pass on the knowledge you've learned from other teachers.
- I feel that being comfortable - being yourself - when you walk into an audition room is a really important thing. I think being able to own every aspect of your life is only going to make you be more comfortable in front of a table of people you don't know.
- You see everyone's true colors in a rehearsal.
- There isn't a way to depict the gay community without at least mentioning the existence of online dating apps like Grindr.
- I am in love with Los Angeles.
- My older sister Celia is an actress as well. She's a little bit older than me. So, in my formative years, she was always performing, and we would always go see her do things. And so, that just made me want to be... like her. Maybe if she was an Olympic swimmer, I would probably be an Olympic swimmer by now as well!
- Any show that has a completely gay ensemble has the very difficult task of trying to represent the community.
- 'Breaking In' shows what it's really like backstage at New York Fringe Theatre.
- Everyone knows how physically demanding 'Newsies' is in terms of the dance, but even the guys in the toughest tracks remark that the singing in this show is often the hardest part. The newsboys are teenagers, and Alan Menken wrote this music in the top of a guy's range.
- Everybody keeps saying what a lucky coincidence that 'Newsies' is happening when it is, with things like Occupy Wall Street.
- I grew up in a time where there were no queer digital references.
- I've been lucky to have grown up in the arts.
