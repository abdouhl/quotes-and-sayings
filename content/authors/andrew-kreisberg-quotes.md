- It's truly an honor to get to write Superman and Batman and Wonder Woman and all those great people, but when you can take something that's not well thought of and make it something that people do think highly of, that's much more gratifying, I think.
- We've never slammed people over the head or made 'The Flash' an after-school special. With us, it's always been presenting the world in which we live. The world in which we live, men and women work together; different races work together, and you have gay friends, and people have relationships. We just try to show that.
- One of the best decisions we made on the 'Arrow' pilot was to have the Deathstroke mask. Within 30 seconds, you knew you were watching a DC comics show.
- I'm a huge fan of 'Buffy,' 'Angel' and 'Doctor Who.' People like Joss Whedon, Russell T. Davies, and Steven Moffat are really amazing about making you feel like you had a complete meal and yet leaving you hungry for more.
- Besides Spiderman and Batman, 'The Flash' has, hands down, the best villains. You could do a TV show about The Rogues, and there's enough depth and interest and oddly honor amongst those characters that I think people will watch that show.
- My wife could give a rip about comic books, but she loves 'Arrow,' and she loves 'The Flash,' and she likes them because of the characters.
- So many heroes are driven by destiny. Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, they were all chosen and born to heroism. Even with Batman, it doesn't feel like Bruce could do anything else. His whole life was leading him to become the Dark Knight.
- I'm a lifelong 'Doctor Who' fan. Like, Peter Davison/Colin Baker, lifelong fan.
- I think one of the great strengths of 'The Flash' is just how close everyone is on the show. They tend not to have these raging conflicts, like what we keep giving everybody on 'Arrow.' That show is more of a soap opera, and I don't say that derogatorily.
- On 'Flash,' you've never seen the last of anybody, no matter what happens to them.
