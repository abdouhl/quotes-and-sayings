- I've only ever done out-and-out serious roles. I've played, like, five serial killers.
- I can completely take a second World War gun apart and put it back together again thanks to 'Band Of Brothers.' That's always useful. I've got lots and lots of random skills I'll probably never need again.
- Gary Oldman is my TV hero. The incredible thing about Gary Oldman is his versatility.
- Even if I play a similar role to one I've played before, I will never play it the same, I'll always try to do something different with it.
- It's really hard to not get put in a box when you're acting and get typecast.
