- Competition among insurers would bring down the cost of health care insurance, just as it brings down the cost of car or homeowners insurance.
- It was a simple question any employee should ask: 'Oh and by the way, how do I get my health insurance to be seamless?'
- Maryland needs someone in Congress who will fight to create jobs, stop out-of-control government spending and defend small businesses.

- People would have a health care insurance policy they can call their own. They could choose one that exactly fits their families' needs and their budgets, be able to take that coverage with them from job to job and be able to fire their insurance company if it doesn't treat them well.
