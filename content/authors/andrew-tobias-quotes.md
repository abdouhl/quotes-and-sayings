- I was a writer for 'New York' magazine. I had been to business school, but what did I know? Still, everybody from the receptionists on up to the editor would ask me what they should do with their money.
- Nobody wants campaign finance reform more than me. It would save me a fortune.
- It's very nice to be able to be who you are.
- There were no jobs created in America from 1945, when the war ended, through 2003. How could there be? Taxes were too high. Preposterously so under Eisenhower, Kennedy, Nixon, Reagan (who left office with a 28 percent rate on long-term capital gains) and Bush the Elder.
- You want 21 percent risk free? Pay off your credit cards.
- Still, most people don't have much money. So finding ways to come out a couple of thousand dollars ahead every year still matters.
- I think a lot of people would rather have more control over their life than less.
- But successful investors tend to be not too self-destructive. They tend to be patient, they tend not to follow the crowd, and they tend not to be too guilty about winning.
- There's no such thing as altruism.
- The best thing I have are 5 percent bonds from 1780, denominated from $1 to $20. As far as I can tell, they are obligations from the United States of America, so I should be able to walk down to the Federal Reserve and redeem the uncanceled ones. With 217 years of accrued interest, for a $20 bond, that's about $800,000.
- One of the advantages of the book's having been out there for more than a quarter century is that there's been time for people to report back on what it's done for them.
