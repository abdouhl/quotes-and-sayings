- I can't work completely out of my imagination. I must put my foot in a bit of truth; and then I can fly free.
- At 18 I began painting steadily fulltime and at age 20 had my first New York show at the Macbeth Gallery.
- I surrendered to a world of my imagination, reenacting all those wonderful tales my father would read aloud to me. I became a very active reader, especially history and Shakespeare.
- I'm a secretive bastard. I would never let anybody watch me painting... it would be like somebody watching you have sex - painting is that personal to me.
- To be interested solely in technique would be a very superficial thing to me.

- It's a moment that I'm after, a fleeting moment, but not a frozen moment.
- It's all in how you arrange the thing... the careful balance of the design is the motion.
- I don't really have studios. I wander around around people's attics, out in fields, in cellars, anyplace I find that invites me.
- Artists today think of everything they do as a work of art. It is important to forget about what you are doing - then a work of art may happen.
- If you clean it up, get analytical, all the subtle joy and emotion you felt in the first place goes flying out the window.
- To have all your life's work and to have them along the wall, it's like walking in with no clothes on. It's terrible.
- I dream a lot. I do more painting when I'm not painting. It's in the subconscious.
- One's art goes as far and as deep as one's love goes.
