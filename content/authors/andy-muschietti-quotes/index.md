- What captivated me about 'The Flash' is the human drama in it.
- At the beginning when you're writing and building the beats of the story, everything that you put in there seems very essential to the story. However, when you have the movie finally edited and it's 4 four hours long, you realise that some of the events and some of the beats can be easily lifted but the essence of the story remains intact.
- We live in a world where there's a culture of fear, where some leaders have a strong pull on people, which is exactly what Pennywise does.
- For horror, the needs of the story have to be first.
- I always put a lot of heart in my movies in general, but in 'It' too, I put a lot of heart in it.
- I'm an artist. I've been doing storyboards for a long, long time.
- Yeah, I didn't grow up in the '50s like Stephen King so I'm more versed in the '80s and the present day than the '50s.
- Argentina is a bit tough to people. You don't embrace genre film in general. They are more like, in the film community, a bit snobby.
- As much as 'It Chapter One' is a movie about friendship and the power of unified belief, the second part is more about trauma.
- I enjoyed clowns when I was a kid going to the circus. Mainly I mean the good clowns, when you go to a circus.
- Casting is a big deal.
- Everything that relates to Pennywise and Bob Gray is very cryptic, and it's like that for a reason. Probably the success of that character as a monster, as a villain is because of that crypticness and uncertainty that people have towards him.
- The character of 'Mama' is so ambitious in a way that everything I did was always on the verge of being almost funny. So you have to be very careful with that. It's that sort of face that you don't usually see in horror.
- IT Chapter Two' is the story of the Losers as adults 27 years later, but they go back to their memories to retrieve something that is very, very necessary. They have to remember who they were, as well as their amazing bond with each other.
- We are a society that really worked to leave our differences behind, and value equality. All these things actually make a community live in harmony.
- I learnt to relax a little more and enjoy the process, which is something I didn't do in my first movie - understandably, I guess.
- Mythology is something that always has opportunities to explore. 'It' has been on Earth for millions of years. He's been in contact with humans for hundreds of years, every 27 years. So you can imagine the amount of material.
- Sequels are always tricky.
- When you're a writer and you're an adult, that's something you crave - that limitless imagination and love for worlds that don't exist that you can create.
- You have to go to what the essence of what Pennywise is about - the dark power of adulthood. It's not coincidence all the grown-ups in town are evil. This is not a story about a monster. It's a story about the end of childhood.
- I think apart from the new spectacle that 'Chapter Two' brings compared to the first one, the scope, scale, bigger canvas, I'm proud of the emotional journey.
- I've always been a big fan of Stephen King, especially in my teenage years.
- Bill Hader, nobody can play Richie like this guy, I think. It was great because, for some reason, 'Chapter Two' was a movie that everyone wanted to be in.
- I like to create characters and worlds, and there's nothing like telling your own stories.
- I'm very ambitious when it comes to cameos.
- Something a lot of people probably don't know is 'Chapter One' did have the idea to make a post-credit scene, which was Beverly Marsh picking up the phone. So, 27 years later, post credit, you would see a phone ringing.
- Pet Sematary' is one of my favorite books of Stephen King and I have a deep love relationship with it.
- It's a horror movie, but it's quite emotional too, and there's a lot of humor.
- Of course, the whole mythology of the world of 'It' is very attractive to me.
- Reading 'IT' again as an adult, you understand it from a different perspective. It is basically a love letter to childhood and talks about all of the treasures of that time, like imagination and belief, that are inevitably lost in adulthood.
- Hate crimes are still happening. No matter how evolved we think society is going, there seems to be a winding back, especially in this day and age where these old values seem to be emerging from the darkness.
- My approach to Pennywise was, on one hand, I wanted to stay true to the essence of the character but at the same time make it an edgier character that is basically unpredictable and people won't expect everything he comes up with.
- I really didn't want to expand the negative vision of clowns because clowns are not intrinsically scary.
- I'm a huge fan of the book and Stephen King is one of my big heroes, literary heroes, and I am a fan, and I want to see a movie of 'It.'
- In fact, one of the descriptions of the character in the book is that 'IT' was not very good at replicating human emotions. And that's something that is overlooked in general.
- When you make a movie, you have to make things denser, you have to build consequentiality.
- Of course it's always easy when you work with people that worked together, or you work with people that you worked with before, because you develop over years some sort of shorthand of communion that is always very valuable.
- One of the greatest things about the book is that everything we know about 'It,' it's pretty speculative. We see it from the point of view of Loser's and that's what makes it so scary. We never get to know exactly what it is.
- I don't have a negative perception of clowns.
- A movie is very different when you're writing the script and you're building a story compared to what the final product is.
- I'm a big fan of Edward Gorey, and I don't think he has been portrayed in film.
- It's like my second home, 'It.' And I would like to return to it, because I feel very comfortable with it, and I have an understanding of it, and I'm passionate about it.
- The moment you introduce the element of IT, which is an interdimensional evil entity, the presence of the turtle comes with it, as a counterbalance.
- I think mainly my devotion to horror comes from international horror movies and literature.
- Yeah, my parents exposed me to horror movies when I was like 6 or 7. I mean exposed me in a good way, they didn't mean any harm.
