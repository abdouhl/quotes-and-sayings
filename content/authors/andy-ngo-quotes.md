- My coverage of Antifa has been critical: not just critical of the hooliganism and the street violence because violence, of course, is easy to condemn. I am critical of the underlying ideology as well.
- EXMNA is a nonprofit that provides support to individuals who have left Islam.
- 'Black bloc' is a tactic that Antifa and other militant movements use where they adopt, essentially, a uniform of wearing black clothing, long sleeve, and mask and sunglasses completely.

- Other tourists might remember London for Buckingham Palace, Piccadilly Circus, and Big Ben. I'll remember it for its failed multiculturalism.
- Portland calls itself a 'sanctuary city,' but it's nothing of the sort for a law-abiding journalist.
- I wanted to cut past the polemics and experience London's Muslim communities for myself.

- While much attention was focused on Germany during the 2015 refugee crisis, in which more than a million migrants from the Middle East and Africa entered the continent at the behest of Angela Merkel, the country that admitted the most migrants per capita was Sweden.
- It is known that some victims don't report crimes against their perpetrator. Many fear that they will not be believed. What is less understood is why anyone might expect people to believe they're the victim of a crime in the absence of evidence.
- I want people to be confronted by the brutality of the Antifa movement.
- I got into journalism, actually, when I started my graduate program at Portland State and ended up becoming the multimedia editor of the student paper and covered very uninteresting stories on campus: this culture event, dance night.

- At an Antifa event meant to resist 'fascist violence,' I - a gay journalist of color - was beaten so badly that I was hospitalized for a brain hemorrhage.
- As somebody who happens to be gay, I particularly resent that minorities are being encouraged to be fragile and bitter.
- The mainstream media describe Antifa as 'antifascist,' but, in fact, it is a far-left paramilitary-style movement of anarchists and communists agitating for a revolution.
