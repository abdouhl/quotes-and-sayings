- As artists, we like night more than day sometimes.
- Americans are hidden dragons to me.
- I took the name Green Destiny from - well there is such a sword called Green Destiny. It is green because you keep twisting it, it's an ancient skill, you keep twisting it and knocking it and twisting it until it is very elastic and light.

- I like to do drama, something about life that could be disappointing.
- I don't have incredible knowledge about films or of filmmaking history; I'm not that kind of person.
- Sometimes films ignore other points of view because it's simpler to tell the story that way, but the more genuine and sympathetic you are to different points of view and situations, the more real the story is.
- On a Chinese film you just give orders, no one questions you. Here, you have to convince people, you have to tell them why you want to do it a certain way, and they argue with you. Democracy.

- I think a movie is a media that is evoking feelings.
- It's not a pleasure torturing actors, although some of them enjoy it.
- What is really a stretch to me is to make quick decisions.
- I am not particularly religious. But I think we do face the question of where God is, why we are created and where does life go, why we exist. That sort of thing. And it is very hard to talk about it these days, because it cannot be proven. It is hard to discuss it rationally.
