- It's my damn duty and obligation to do everything possible for Europe to find a united path.
- The markets want to force us to do certain things. That we won't do. Politicians have to make sure that we're unassailable, that we can make policy for the people.
- It is nonsense to say that Germans are unable to change.
- So Europe needs to be competitive and we also need to be competitive if we wish to remain an interesting economic partner for the United States. This has to be done on the basis of strength, of competitiveness.

- Multiculturalism leads to parallel societies and therefore remains a 'life lie.'
- Personally, I think that for example the chemical directive in its present form does too much damage to the chemical industry - especially the medium sized businesses - and will hurt our worldwide competitiveness.
- The question is not whether we are able to change but whether we are changing fast enough.
- In many regions, war and terror prevail. States disintegrate. For many years, we have read about this. We have heard about it. We have seen it on TV. But we had not yet sufficiently understood that what happens in Aleppo and Mosul can affect Essen or Stuttgart. We have to face that now.

I don't know - maybe there are other things I didn't talk about because no one ever asked me.

We are firmly convinced that this is something that will have to be handed over to generations to come... so we don't see any reason to change our view of history.

- This multicultural approach, saying that we simply live side by side and live happily with each other has failed. Utterly failed.

- I am for our not having any discrimination in tax legislation.
- We're saying this to both countries: We want a two-state solution. We want a Jewish state of Israel and alongside a independent Palestinian state.

- There is a lot that binds Germany to Turkey, and even if we have a difference of opinion on an individual matter, the breadth of our links, our friendship, our strategic ties, is great.
- Here we have the Schengen agreement, and the truth is that for years we trusted each other and set border controls on the outer borders of the European Union. And as was the case with the economic and monetary union, with this step, regarding the management of the Schengen area, we did not go all the way in terms of political solutions.
- On the one hand, the financial projection is on the agenda - we will see if this problem can be resolved or not. I think it is a right idea to stage a special summit, which would deal with the question of priorities of European politics.
- If we remind ourselves of the fact that every fifth American today rightly points and perhaps also with a certain degree of pride to his German ancestry or her German ancestry, we can safely say that we, indeed, share common roots.
