- I am honoured to be invited by our respected Prime Minister Shri Narendrabhai Modi to join the 'Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.' I dedicate myself to this movement and will invite nine other leading Indians to join me in the 'Clean India' campaign.
- Sadness... reflecting on the proud legacy of trust and fair play on which Reliance Industries was founded by my visionary father Dhirubhai Ambani, and how far RIL appeared to have moved away from those original values.
- I entered KC College in 1975. When I came here for my interview, for my admission, every person I spoke to spoke to me in Sindhi. Be it Kundanani, Bhambani, Nichani, Kevalramani... and they also thought that Ambani was the same. For a moment, I thought that I got my admission at KC College because I have a 'ni' in my surname.
- I am extremely proud to have the surname Ambani. I am proud to be a Gujarati, and above all, an extremely proud Indian.
