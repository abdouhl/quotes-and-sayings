- The inspiration for 'Ai Dil Mere' happened at 4:30 A.M. on a Sunday.
- I would love to work in Bollywood.
- The night we released 'Why This Kolaveri Di?,' I went home and played all the songs I had composed since I was in Class 6. I had a great time playing them and revisiting how much I had grown and evolved over the years as a musician.

- I've never flirted with a fan.
- I am not a very good singer.
- I did sing a track for Dhanush's '3,' but that's because the track required a voice like mine.
- I'm shy by nature, not just around girls but guys as well.
- No, I don't want to act.
- '3' is a wonderful film.
- Music has no language. That's something I've come to believe in even more ever since 'Kolaveri Di' happened. I don't deliberately make separate Tamil, Hindi, or Telugu tracks.

- I've been a musician since my childhood.
- When I'm working, I don't think about other things. I go into a zone.
- From my childhood, I never wanted to do anything else but create music. From my first piano to setting up my studio, all I ever wanted was to give it all my time.
- 'Kolaveri' is one song that people feel connected to. While I am bored of the song, it seems people aren't. I really can't say what worked. But I can definitely say that the song made me what I am today.
- You have to keep proving yourself over and over again.
- A musician's true talent is only tested through background music.
- I make it a point to make a new song every day.
- In the case of '3,' the makers let me be. That worked out really well.
