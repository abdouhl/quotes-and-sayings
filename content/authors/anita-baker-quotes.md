- Long tresses down to the floor can be beautiful, if you have that, but learn to love what you have.
- I made numerous attempts to find a way to do it all, to be a creative singer, songwriter, producer, and to be the mother, daughter, sister, lover, wife. And the thing about music is, with me, that she's a harsh mistress. She does not come to me in the midst of stress.
- I love radio, but it's a very limited thing today. Everything has to be edited down to 3:59, and too bad if I didn't make my statement in three minutes and 59 seconds. Everybody's song has to make its point so quickly.

- I need my career. That's what validates me.
- I don't let people use me. That's why I like a small number of people in my life. The more people in my life, the more complex it becomes, so I just try to keep it at a minimum.
- If I could be doing anything, I'd be laying on the floor in my birthday suit eating junk food and watching something dumb on TV.
- It's impossible to write and produce a record when your parents are dying. I really tried, I really, really tried, but it just wouldn't come.
- I'd love to be the political voice of my generation, but that's not my gift.
- Oh my goodness, they are rocking so many variations of my high-top fade. I mean, Rihanna has taken it to a very angular 21st Century thing. Miss Fantasia has it in a very seductive, you know, up-flip, and it's just lovely, right? Oh, I think it's wonderful.
- I would say that my peak was making my first million at the ripe age of 29, after the first album.
- I'm picking and choosing in terms of the stress factor. If it's not fun, I'm not going to do it.
- You leave home to seek your fortune and, when you get it, you go home and share it with your family.
- Applause felt like approval, and it became a drug that soothed the pain, but only temporarily.
- As soon as you get off stage, that's the most dangerous time for a singer to kiss people because your vocal chords are receptive to any kind of germ.
- Most artists are notoriously insecure, and I fall into that category.
- I used to sing at funeral homes for families that didn't have a vocalist. I didn't get paid. I needed to sing.
- If you have your own agenda and your own style and you don't easily conform to what the masses are doing, you're looked upon as being difficult. Whereas, I think of it as just being an individual.

- We don't do drugs, drink or use profanity. Instead we instill morals and values in my boys by raising them with a love of God and a love and respect for themselves and all people. I believe they will have a chance.
- I have as many pictures of my vocal cords as I do of my children. I have a great ear, nose and throat doctor, and we look at them - if there's some redness, maybe I'll take a little time off.
- When you're away for a long time, tastes change, fans move on. You hate to think about it, but it's an ugly fact of life.
- I don't even have voice mail, and people get all out of shape about that. But, you know what, I don't want to transcribe your message; I want to talk to you. And that kind of freaks people out a bit. They go, 'Oh, who has time to talk?' and I'm like, 'Well, I'm gonna make time.'
- Chris Brown is brilliant. That cat is crazy brilliant, and I wish him the best.
