- You have to have patience and confidence that your things will let you know where they need to go. Particularly artwork. Paintings will tell you where they want to be.
- I do like the ocean wave, actually. I'm born under the sign of Cancer - the sign of the crab - so I like coastal areas and sunny beaches and such - although not the wide-open and deep seas.
- It was great to work in Ireland because it's such a beautiful country, but it's not particularly easy to film in because the weather changes all the time.
- Gabriel Garcia Marquez's 'One Hundred Years of Solitude' is such a powerful book, and 'Love in the Time of Cholera' is so strangely, brilliantly optimistic.
- I had one nanny who made me sit in front of a bowl of porridge for three or four days running when I refused to eat it. I remember being very unhappy about that.

- I'm not really big on slapstick humor. I like gentle humor.
- I think all actors - they'll hate me for saying this - but we are babies. We like to be loved, and we'll do anything if we're loved.

- It's the nature of an actor to have to use sense memory.
- Oh, all kinds of lunacy happens in Ireland, all kinds of lunacy.
- People often think that looking in the mirror is about narcissism. Children look at their reflection to see who they are. And they want to see what they can do with it, how plastic they can be, if they can touch their nose with their tongue, or what it looks like when they cross their eyes.
- I know certainly, when one job draws to a close, that I feel I'm simply never going to work again. No one will ever want me for anything ever again. I think that's a vulnerable moment in every actor's life, and it happens every time you finish a film.

We were forced to be together because we were really quite alone. We were in the middle of the Irish countryside, in County Galway, in the West of Ireland, and we didn't see many other kids.
- When you don't have a nine-to-five job, and you're with somebody who gets a tremendous amount of attention, it's not that you resent it - it's that you have all that extra time to think about it.
- When you're in your twenties, you're made of expectations, and when they're shattered, you don't know how to behave. The fact is if you react really outraged, you fear that you'll get dropped and feel even more terrible. But there's only a certain amount you can put up with before you become obnoxious in your own eyes, right?
- In 1969, when I was still living in London, I had gone with some friends to see 'Easy Rider' in a movie theater in Piccadilly Circus and had returned alone some days later to see it again. It was Jack's combination of ease and exuberance that had captured me from the moment he had come on-screen.
- I must confess I love female writers: Jane Austen, Isak Dinesen, Colette, Willa Cather, Dawn Powell, Joan Didion. I grew up on the Bronte sisters, and Daphne du Maurier.
- Where there is age there is evolution, where there is life there is growth.
- I've always thought with relationships, that it's more about what you bring to the table than what you're going to get from it. It's very nice if you sit down and the cake appears. But if you go to the table expecting cake, then it's not so good.

- I'm happy to do voice-overs. I always have a good time doing them. I like to explore vocal nuance and accents and different people, different personalities. In a way, it is a lot more freeing than having your face up there.

- There's a moment in one's life when you should really be de-accessorizing instead of making more collections.
- The idea that women are actually getting some jobs - whoopee. I can't say that I celebrate it without a hint of cynicism, because I think of how easily things can drop away and go back to the same old routine of being a boys' show. But I think it's a wonderful thing that women are getting to direct more.
- During the four years I had spent in New York, I had achieved top status as a model and had worked for the best photographers and designers in the world. I had grown used to hearing that I was exotic and high-fashion.

I would pretend to be Morticia Addams. I was drawn to her. I used to pull my eyes back and see how I'd look with slanted eyelids.
- I think women like to conquer hearts. Men like to conquer countries.
