- For 'Manikarnika', I've learnt horse riding and sword fighting, so I have gone out of my comfort zone.
- People don't stereotype an actor anymore because they want to see them doing more content driven roles. I can do any role. I'm not worried about getting typecast because I'm doing a period film.

- When you start living in with a person, over a period of time, you could start losing interest. That's when you could lose out on important things and marriage is one of those big things.
- Love is about what you feel and I feel that about my dance and my acting.

- I'm sure I will play the typical Hindi film heroine and have my song and dance routines in future.
- I believe in hard work. So that's not changed. And my love for cinema is something I was born with. But, personally, I am more in control of my emotions and because my focus is work, personal life is all about family and friends and my two dogs.
- Love and work are two separate things.
- When a girl is single, everyone wants to find out who she is dating.
- Whenever I get married in future, I will continue to work.
- I believe in giving love to everyone, including my family, dogs and myself, and not just the person I get married to.
- I am okay being friends with an ex. You don't become enemies. Everybody has their own journey and they leave when the time is over. Maybe, they are only meant to be with you for that particular time.
- Honestly, I have always been content. When I was working, I was satisfied; when I wasn't, I was still happy. I'm okay with whatever I do.
- Relationships are very important, because that's the bond you share with someone and that's how love grows between people.
- I want to do masala movies. I love the Bollywood films that we are known for. I love the whole song and dance act.
