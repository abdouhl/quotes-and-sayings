- You hang around actors, or dancers, the minute you sneeze, everybody has a remedy, and we're all on a million different kinds of diets, and different kinds of things that we do for exercise.
- To live your life well, and have respect for what came before or after - there's a strong respect for that in African culture.
- In my own life I'm frequently in predominantly white atmospheres.
- Suddenly in high school, I'm in a predominantly Jewish atmosphere. Jewish people were my gate to white America.
- We would like doctors to listen, but the fact is, we better be ready to be able to talk to them. You're going to have to be an active participant in that conversation, so I'd say the American people are going to need ways of stepping up to the conversation.

- Each person has a literature inside them.
- When I got out of acting school, I was lucky to have gotten any job at all. A lot of people hiring African American actresses - it was right after 'Roots,' and for society, not me, it was great. Nice richly dark-skinned people was the fashion, and I was not.
- Well, the terrible thing right now, and I don't know the statistics, but there's a growing concern in some communities about how rapidly people are sent from school to jail, how quickly they're put into the criminal justice system. And of course the rapidly growing number of brown people, both men and women, in prison. And this is terrible.
- I talk about race a lot. It's been my work ever since I came out of acting school. But it's true that in a way talking about race is a taboo. Because so many of our debates about race have to do not with race but with what we are willing to see, what we will not see and what we don't want to see.

- I think a lot of L.A. is something like USC - this incredible white culture living in the midst of color, and no obvious reaction to it at all.

- I think as a kid I always liked to listen to people. I loved hearing stories.
- Somehow we can't live outside the politics of race. There's something very deep in all of us, that is taught to us when we are very, very little. Which is the disrespect and fear of the other.
- Racism has been for everyone like a horrible, tragic car crash, and we've all been heavily sedated from it. If we don't come into consciousness of this tragedy, there's going to be a violent awakening we don't want. The question is, can we wake up?
- The American idea is as promising, imaginative, and full of the unexpected as the land itself. The land represents freedom - the frontier, the ability to make a new future with your own bare hands.
- We owe the government taxes. We owe our creditors interest. What do these powers owe us?
- Probably the person who said the only color in Los Angeles is green was right.

- When you think about it, words can break your heart, or they can change your day.

- I mean, I think that - as an actress, in particular, I'm basically a fool, and I see the world upside down.
- I write plays about big, intense subjects.
- You know, all kinds of people inspire me.
- I am interested in personal stories because that's when people become expressive, spontaneous and heartfelt.
- I love studying how people are. Not just what they're saying, but how they are, what they're doing.
- Identity is an assemblage of constellations.
- You know, interesting minds usually do hold more than one idea at a time.

- Artists are the people that no matter what, pick up the pen, pick up a paintbrush. They take the time to translate what is happening to create something that resonates deeply with the rest of the people that are caught in the middle of their own reality.
- President Obama called for a 'we' nation in his Inauguration Address. Art convenes. It is not just inspirational. It is aspirational. It pricks the walls of our compartmentalized minds, opens our hearts and makes us brave. And that's what we need most in our country today.
- I don't talk a lot when I interview. My job is to get out of the way.
- I was a mimic when I was a child. I mimicked the teacher and made friends that way, actually. That was a very subversive activity, because I was a goody-goody who never got in trouble. But if I went off in the corner and mimicked the teacher, people loved it.
- Over time, my students have gotten richer and more educated.
- I made a real specific decision when I came out of school and most artists were writing about home - if you were a woman, you were writing about being a woman - and I decided not to do that, write about what you know. That's not what I do. I went as far away from home as possible in terms of the development of my imagination.
- What my work is, is my approach to it. It's the practice. And my work is about the effort that I make to get there. And I think if there's anything artistic, it's in that middle space.
- That artists are called to be more responsible and 'true' is a tip of hat to their power.
- I have a lot of optimism about new doctors because I think it's really clear that it's a lot of hard work and no guarantee of a lot of money.
