- I'm one of those people who really wants to do everything. And if I had enough time, I really would.
- I would not be allowed to be in the web series without playing 'Halo.' I'm awful, by the way. I'm much better at the live action version.
- When people send people on summer camps or bonding trips, they send them to do things like high rope climbing or extraordinary things. And when you do extraordinary things with people, like fighting battles or simulating huge wars, you do bond very quickly.
- What I love is acting, and the technical stuff does tend to slow things down.
