- Actors should be timeless and impersonal.
- Knowing what I know of love, I hang back because I don't like to lie to myself.
- On the surface I look fragile and insecure; you have to know me very well.
- It's terrifying, that unconditional love you have for a child. I still wonder if she really came from me, from my womb. It's a miracle. I don't understand it. I live it very intensely.
- I had never even thought I'd be an actress - I was supposed to be a lawyer. But the motivation is the same: when you act, you defend a role; you have to be convincing. It's the same career.
- I try to live the moment and not obey laws, rules, conventions, or norms; to react to a sensation, a feeling, or an emotion. You can't program emotion.
- I adore people who ask questions and who cause others to share in their search.
- You have to get it in your brain that you don't belong to yourself as an actor, but that you belong to the director who creates the character.
- To what purpose is it to be artificially happy on the surface?
- Body language is essential for an actress, even if you don't use your body in an athletic way. Just to be free, to use it like your voice. A body can be small and have incredible violence. A body talks.
