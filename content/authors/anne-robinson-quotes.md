- Sad old blokes, I'm told, now dream of me with a whip in hand.
- Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the dumbest of you all?
- I have never, for a single moment, been aware of pressure from anyone in television about how I dress, what my shape is or how I speak. I've always written my own scripts. I've always been the first to point out that I need to be fit. I need to look good.
- Every couple needs glue to stay together. Like all marriages, I suspect, if you're busy you don't see it coming until you can't put the toothpaste back in the tube. It's a bit like going broke. It happens slowly and then very quickly.
- If there's anything about longevity in television, it's about knowing what to take and what to turn down, and what to stop.
- I like to look put together without trying too hard. I don't want to look as if God's made another rainbow - I prefer muted, autumnal colours, like most fading redheads.
- I like one nice man because he gets three tickets for the cinema so we've got somewhere to put our coats. He passes the test. I've been quite surprised because I really didn't expect to be wined and dined, and it's quite nice.
- I knew I'd conquered America when Mike Tyson told me I was one mean lady.
- I saw George Bush at a benefit concert actually waving at Stevie Wonder. Someone had to tell him 'he can't see you'.
- I adore clothes - they're my weakest link! My mother was the same, and she taught me always to look polished.
- I'm not going to marry a third time. It is just not necessary.
- We mothers of grown-up daughters tend to view them with a mixture of love, exasperation, irritation and awe.
- My favourite designers are Alexander McQueen, YSL, Eskandar, Donna Karan and Lanvin.
- Who should have spent their money on a brain implant?
- Believe me, I've done my time travelling the world in cramped conditions and carrying my own luggage. Now my leisure is summers in the south of France or the Hamptons, walking in Connemara, and year-round shopping in Manhattan and Paris.
- I've had a lot of dates, but I don't think there's been anyone that special or important.
- I was thrilled when a designer shop assistant said I was a size smaller than Madonna!
- Every mother and daughter should make time for a trip together. It's good for the soul.
- In an ideal world, I'd be able to do my shows in my pajamas. Luckily I've got one of the best stylists in the business, Rebecca Allen - she knows what looks good on camera and gives it a sexy kick.
- I am dating, but it is hard to find someone quick enough and funny enough. I am quite demanding.
