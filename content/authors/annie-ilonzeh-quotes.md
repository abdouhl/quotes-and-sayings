- Your legacy makes a difference.
- I relate to both my Caucasian side and my African side, and I love that.
- I was a manicurist in another life.
- I have always wanted to do something high octane. I've wanted to tackle an action role where I play a tomboy but empower myself as a woman.
- I come from an interracial family: My father is from Nigeria, and so he is African-American, and my mother is American and white, so I rarely see skin color. It's never an issue for me.
- I think Pac is one of those artists that generations on generations know who this guy is, as an artist, as an activist, as an actor - entertainer across the board. I think the new generations of entertainers and artists can be influenced by him just as much as people in the '90s.
- I'm not going to have beautiful curves or Kim Kardashian's body. I just have to accept that.
- I'm a super tomboy.
- You can go as far as you want to go.
- My dad's Nigerian, and I remember going to Nigeria, and all of these kids and adults and everyone in-between knew who TuPac was. They had TuPac t-shirts, TuPac posters, TuPac cassettes... everyone knew TuPac, and sometimes that was the only English that they spoke, was TuPac lyrics.
- Being pampered is great, but sometimes I like to do those things myself because it's a little therapeutic and gives me some downtime for myself - and I need that.
- To know that someone decades later is still just as impactful as they were when they were alive, we need pioneers like that.
- I know stories of Pac, but I was really, really young when he passed. The fact that he was such a thespian, and so passionate about his craft, was shocking to me in a way.
- I'm really good with sweats, not really good with heels, and not really good with accessorizing yet.
- I'm proud - or really more thankful than anything - for all the work that I've gotten.
- I feel like decades ago it was either you're black, white, Asian or Hispanic, or whatever, but today we see more of an acceptance for people with multi-nationalities.
- I've been introduced to some huge designers that I could never afford. It's really cool.
- I want to touch the world through my performances on screen but also off screen.
- 'Graceland' getting canceled was definitely a shock and disappointing for all of us. One minute it's this. The next minute it's that.
- Tupac is huge; he's an inspiration. Arguably, he's probably the biggest, most analyzed and loved artist of all time.
