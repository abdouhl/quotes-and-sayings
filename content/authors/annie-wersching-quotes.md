- Portugal has amazing seafood with all the eyeballs staring back at you.
- I knew I'd love being a mom, but it's so much cooler than I even thought it would be.
- 'Bosch' itself - it has a huge fanbase already from the Michael Connelly books, so it was definitely intriguing because you know going in that there's all those people who will want to watch it, and I knew it was going to be a down-and-dirty, gritty, no-make-up part, so that was scary and yet so exciting.

- '24' was so serious that it was nice to join 'NCIS' and even be able to smile once or twice.
- I was a diehard fan of '24' since the beginning. But being on the show, there was stuff I never thought about as a viewer, like, wow, it's going to be a single day for 10 months out of your life - you have to look exactly the same every day.

- The standard that '24' is held to is higher than at other shows. A weaker episode of '24' would be an amazing episode for a lot of other shows.
- A huge part of Irish dance is balance, which is so good for any kind of combat - just being aware of your body.
