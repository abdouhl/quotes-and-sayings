- I love it that my father is such a classical musician and such a traditionalist, and at the same time has had a wild life and a crazy time.
- I'm not pretending I can change the world, or to be an expert on social and political affairs. But I certainly have a right to say when something is wrong.
- The lockdown, in general, left me with a sense of needing to become more independent and instead of being intimidated, I decided to do the engineering on some of my new releases.
- The sitar is a really difficult instrument to play. Physically it's taxing because of the cross-legged sitting position, the length of the neck on the shoulder, the thinness of the strings. There's a lot of pain, especially at the start.
- There is no everlasting power in the music of today. Everyone is running after record sales.
- I do think evolution is an important aspect of keeping a tradition alive. If it freezes and remains very static in its form, it dies, and so a natural evolution has to occur.
- Writing can flow out when I'm feeling something strongly, whether that's joy, pain, fear, desire or anything else. The challenge is actually later, in the second or third or 100th draft of the music, when it can be so easy to cover up the original sentiments by making the music more ornate or cloaked.
- I think I've been lucky to work with so many lovely people. But there's Joshua Bell, who's the world's greatest violinist. We worked together live and once, for his record, but I really would want to work with him on one of my records.
- But I had a strong reaction to my first three albums and I struggle with them now, as an adult. It's very much the same as looking at your teenage photos in high school.
- I think we are all individuals at the end of the day. There's nothing about culture that can prescribe who you're meant to be.
- My father taught me to play the sitar when I was seven years old. He and his elder disciples oversaw my teaching from the beginning, looking after my scale work, the poor things.
- It is that kind of space, that little space of longing, whether it is in something like romantic love, or whether it's in something like divine love. You know, that kind of search for something that's not quite in your grasp. It's a very powerful place to explore as an artist, because it's not necessarily sad.
- I would write songs, inspired by my baby, but then I could tell that my baby was also responding to the music. It was just kind of an amazing musical experience.
- So many silly things happen with a baby around. We laugh more than we expected.
- I think cross-cultural dialogue is something that has hugely impacted the richness of the culture of our world.
- Alchemy is one of the good quote-unquote south-Asian experiences in that it has a wide variety of classical to experimental music.
- I would not want to do anything that would take away from my career in music. I will always be a musician first.
- Writing for a film means the music has to serve the film, the narrative.
- I try and approach other music with sensitivity. And, if it's music I don't know, I try and work with other people who are well-versed it in, so that it's done sensitively.
- Some of the more intensive scrutiny when I was first starting out definitely used to be tough to handle; I was only a teenager, yet was being analysed in newspapers world over, often by people who already had a strong opinion about my privilege before hearing me play.
- I think it's helped me to have two unconventional parents, who have always encouraged me to be myself.
- Everybody gets opportunities; what you do with them is up to you.
- I live in the modern world, and I appreciate the most cutting-edge parts of it. But I also like to check out as much as I can.
- I hope it isn't exclusively true, but I often find that collaboration is the best way... to reach my highest musical place. Because I get so inspired by another good musician; I feed off that.
- My shows have room for a bit of improvisation. In a film, you can't have that risk; you can't have someone taking 10 seconds longer.
- I listen to many forms of music. And I come from a very particular style and tradition of music, which has certain elements that are absolutely unique and, therefore, important to the world.
- Music is my passion, it's my fun - but what's really important are the people I build a family with. That comes first.
- I've worked hard and tried to approach my career with as much honesty and integrity as possible. I've also had many blessings along the way and feel very fortunate to have a career that speaks so much to my soul.
- I suppose if you make enough money with one album, you can relax the rest of your life. I would rather go for smaller and stronger successes.
- I am a very curious person, not just about my life in music. I love arts and creativity.
- My studio was built with a team of experts to record the sitar at the highest level possible, and I'm very happy with the results.
- On 'Love Letters' I focused exclusively on sung music, creating a collection of songs that directly address heartbreak and its ensuing emotions in a way that instrumental music can only hint at.
- I have had other offers before but for my first film, I did not want to do anything too big.
- I would say 'Home' is a lot richer and deeper than my earlier classical.
- I ate Bengali food after my parents married and Dad started living with us, in both Willesden and in Delhi for three years, and then we all moved to California. Dad said he could make a really good dal, but I never saw him cook during the whole time we lived together.
- Home' was a special album for very specific reasons. It is an homage to my father. And it is the first classical album I've released in over a decade. So it really felt like a kind-of coming back to my roots.
- Occasionally, if I'm in doubt over specific Indian classical or raga-related questions, I'll find myself going back to my lesson tapes or my father's recordings.
- I think the reason being Ravi Shankar's daughter is not such a pressure to me is that I don't look at myself in that way. Of course, he's the best-known Indian musician there is so, people naturally look to me as the next one, but the truth is there are many other musicians out there as well as other students of my father's.
- I have been given something really, really special and really unique, and it is not just in and of itself having learned from my father, who is the greatest exponent of this musical style. But it is an oral tradition that is only generally passed on in that manner, and so without the people who continue to... learn it and perform it, it dies.
- However, I need to make music that represents my inner truth and inner voice. I've found myself more able to do that within an international space that has an Indianness at its root but branches out to encompass sounds and cultures across borders.
- My memories of mealtimes are a real bleed of music and food. Music never really stopped in the music room, because everyone would move out to the table with their sitars.
- I work in the music world in a kind of very multi-faceted way. I work around the world, in different genres.
- The kind of love people in India shower on me is overwhelming.
- I lived with my teacher and he was my father and he practiced every day so I practiced every day and we practiced every day together.
- As a disciple of my father's, I was certain I wanted to include one of his own raga creations on 'Home', as they are so beautiful; whilst many of his creations are part of the general classical repertoire for all musicians, many more are only played by those of us who learned from him, and therefore need to be played.
- Parenting put music in the right place for me. Touring was always the first priority before, but it isn't any more. And, paradoxically, that has made my ability to make music much easier.
- My mother is an amazing vocalist and a lot of my grounding in music has come from her. She was a student of Lakshmi Shankar, my father's sister- in- law.
- I just felt drawn towards the kind of music that really needed a strong female presence female writers, female producers, female figures and that just kind of unfolded on its own.
- I realised how rarely women are involved in all aspects of the music making, how rarely I've worked with female engineers. That became something that I started looking at as well. How many women can I bring into the project across the board.
- Even though my parents raised me in a very individualistic way, they were also strict and traditional, which was good. It was hard to sneak out! I think I was quite wild, but in some ways quite contained.
- I always had musicians in my band having children, and their wives were the ones at home taking care of the kids. So I never thought much of it. And then suddenly I'm the parent, but I'm the woman, and it's like, 'Ah, what happens now?'
- I have been in public for a long time, so the camera was never an issue for me. I am very comfortable in front of a camera.
- With 'Peradam', the nature of the project was such that it was deeply immersed in spiritual concepts in India and is based on the works of French poet Rene Daumal.
- I had multiple circles of friends around the world. Some circles were really wild and I was affectionately known by them as 'the nerdy one.' And, with other friends, I was regarded as the wild one.
- My parents were very unusual. They were pro-women and independence and they wanted me to have my own career. And because of my lineage, every door was opened for me.
- I think all kids are creative, so I wouldn't say my kids are geniuses. But they immediately respond to music. And they've got great rhythm!
- The Grammys are very wide-ranging but it's still within the Western world of music. So it would be lovely if that opened up more.
- On 'Love Letters', I focused exclusively on songs with lyrics, creating a collection of songs that directly address heartbreak and its ensuing emotions in a way that instrumental music can only hint at.
- Someone like my father will improvise as much as 90% of the music in concert, but with me it's maybe 10 to 20%. It's sort of the test of how great someone is, the more they can improvise correctly and still be true to the raga they're playing, and still keep it new and fresh the whole time.
- As far as using electronics in my music, I have to do that as honestly as possible. Also, I have a broad range of listeners from a classical music base, as well as people, like me, who listen to a lot of different music. So I'm mindful of letting my sitar playing remain at the center of what I do.
- Mum's home food was comfy, exquisite and she was also capable of the most wonderful gourmet food. She'd mix the rice and dal with stuff and roll these easy-to-pick-up extra-softened little balls of rice.
- My mother is half Malayali and half Tamilian. I can speak Bengali and Tamil, but can't read or write.
- My father had a sitar made for me that was half the size of a normal one.
- But when culture becomes a baggage, things don't work. What is good about anything that feels like a baggage? I think we should let go when it feels like a burden. Hold on to the things you love. Then it will be a natural process.
- 'Acceptance' is a tricky word. Acceptance about what life is bringing us in a spiritual sense is one thing; but acceptance when there's injustice in the world is completely another.
- There is great strength in vulnerability, as it takes courage to push through the fear and share one's true self with others. In music, that vulnerability really speaks to listeners as it connects with their own hearts.
- I've been to the Grammy's several times for my past nominations and it has always a fun experience.
- I do feel a commitment to this art form and to my father's teachings, and the older I am getting, the more I am feeling it.
- Having my own studio at home is a dream, as I have a totally sound-proof room I can escape to when I need to write, and I have an impeccable room to record in.
- Usually, I really only look at any one particular album at a time when I'm making it. I've never really sat and looked at the journey through all of my albums to see if I could find a thread through them.
- Shiraz' is an important part of our filmmaking and cultural history.
- I feel a lot closer to music and my relationship with my instrument than I did as a teenager. I have an adult perspective now about getting to do something I love for a living.
- When I work on someone else's record, I'm happy to alter the way I approach it, if I happen to like who they are and I'm interested in their music. But I know it's their record.
- I do feel a commitment to this art form and to my father's teaching, and I think the older I get I'm feeling that more and more strongly.
- In the last few years in particular, I've found that it's okay to let go of culture rather than hold on to it. And by letting go, you kind of realise that it's there anyway.
- You know, I think becoming a parent has really changed the way that I feel impacted by what's going on in the world around me.
- As a child I'd sit at dinner parties with artists, authors and musicians, some of the best people in their fields. I couldn't avoid the path I took having grown up in such an artistic environment.
- I really am a fan of combining worlds in my own life.
- In a studio context, the music becomes greater than the sum of its parts. When you have collaboration, you have other people's strengths that I don't share, so my song can get stronger.
- Even though my father had a really successful career before the '60s, that kind of insane pop-culture splash that happened was so massive. People hear the sitar and immediately think, you know, flying carpets and tie-dyed T-shirts and wafting smoke.
- We need more women in positions of power so that women's issues are thought of more, because a room full of men in government and in power don't think the type of things needed to make a change.
- Listen with an open ear is the first, most important thing to do. From there, if people feel like learning more, that's when you can kind of go deeper.
- People are more willing to dislike your music and want to find faults in you when you are given opportunities like in my case. But I think in my case, people love my work and that's why I have to work doubly hard.
- I feel 'Love Letters' has been part of a longer journey towards a very simple, international sound in which the sitar is no longer exotic or classical, but simply a tool of expression when juxtaposed with the voice and cross-genre elements.
- There's a very primal, emotional response I feel when I hear flamenco.
- Not every one knows of the connection between the Indian and the Spanish music, but if they do they seem to have a real reverence for that connection. A love point in music.
- I think sometimes when you speak about something like 'Indian classical music' and 'ragas,' and all of that's new to people, it can be quite intimidating, in the same way that I have sometimes found opera and Wagner intimidating - one doesn't know where to begin sometimes.
- As a musician, it's only natural that my music mirrors my life.
- My father was a pioneer and a leader in the things he did and the way he did them.
- I have that typical girly aspect to me and those domestic ideals. When I cook in my kitchen it's like playing a game because it's not real for me; room service is.
- I love collaborations because they take your music in a different way.
- But there was a lot of pressure to achieve and to get things right, whether in school, on stage or with my peers and family.
- George Harrison became my uncle - not by blood but through love. It's sort of an Indian cultural thing.
