- There's always an extra 10% you give when it's live as suppose to do a pre-recorded show.
- Some presenters can go their whole careers without even having one of the shows that we've got. It's better than working for a living, let's be honest!
- Me and Dec are long in the tooth now - we've seen every Bush Tucker trial there is.
- People are always telling me to cheer up.
- We never wanted to move to a niche slot at 11 at night so that we could be a lot cleverer and bluer. We just want to do those big light-entertainment shows we loved as kids.
- There's no excuse for drink-driving.
- It was never really an ambition of ours to crack the States. Things happen and people ask you to do stuff, but we never sat there and said, 'Oh, my God, we must break America!'
- I do believe that nurture has a great deal to do with how you end up as a human being.
- The difference between doing a live show and a sitcom is that a sitcom can live on. If you do it well, it can leave a legacy, whereas most of our live work never gets repeated because it's final, it's done, you start again.
- We love the 'Britain's Got Talent' process, we love interacting and responding with the public, it's just good fun.
- I think I'm quite up and down, I'm quite hyper. Either hyper up or down.
- When we have time off I think we just want to play a bit of golf.
- I've took stock of things and said, 'Right I've got to think of me.'
- SM:TV' is where we learned our trade. It was young, we could try out new sketches every week. When we got better ratings than our BBC rival, 'Live And Kicking,' it was amazing.
- You're somebody and nobody in a split-second. This is a business.
- Not bipolar, but I lean towards manicness and then lowness.
- If it wasn't for 'Byker Grove' we wouldn't be where we are today.
- We're never really spotted falling out of nightclubs. We don't go to places where there are photographers hanging out.
- We always hark back to what we used to love watching as kids: 'Noel's House Party,' 'Don't Forget Your Toothbrush,' shows that had that live excitement about them. You never knew what was going to happen and I found that really engaging.
- Life just swallowed me up for a few years.
- Life hit me hard.
- I would say I've definitely been humbled for the better.
- Dec's punctuality leaves a lot to be desired.
- Some people are very cynical about it, but we're not trying to replace Bob and Terry.
- You shouldn't worry who gets the funny line, just that you're being funny as a double act. With us, it flips all the time. There's no real straight man or funny man.
- I was one of four blokes that done drama at my school.
- The thing about 'CD:U.K.' was, because the show started quite small with small viewing figures and it built and built, the bigger the figures got, the better and bigger the pop star you got.
- If either of us really desperately wanted to do anything on our own it wouldn't be a problem. But we think of projects that involve the two of us. We actually like working together. It's what we do.
- For years I thought of many other people. As we all do. But we should all step back and say, 'What's making me unhappy? What's not working for me? What can I take out for a bit and take out long-term that will help me a bit?'
- My dad and I didn't speak for a long time, but we're talking again now, which is great.
- I was a massive arachnophobe - I just hated spiders.
- A divorce will always change your life because it's such an upheaval. It's such a change.
- For a double act to work, you shouldn't have egos.
- Sometimes we spend 20 minutes just watching Carol Vorderman brush her hair in the mornings.
- I've got ADHD. I don't mind talking about that.
- I let a lot of people down, and for that I am truly sorry.
- I'm kind of an all-round good guy.
- I'm a bit of a geek when it comes to historical events, so to get the chance to research our family history using our DNA was too good an opportunity to pass up.
- We kind of had a rule where we said we're not just going to do something in the States for the sake of it. We would host a show only if we would host the same show back home.
- We're really excited to be partnering with Santander. They presented us with a really fun creative which we couldn't resist, who would say no to having their own bank brought to life.
- Obviously there's some kind of life elsewhere. I don't know whether it would look like anything we recognise but I do believe in aliens.
- I think Jonathan Ross is brilliant.
- If it happens, it happens, but because everything is going so well over here, we're not dying to break America.
- Among double acts, Morecambe and Wise are number one, definitely.
- Just saying I'd like to do a sitcom is poison words, isn't it?
- When our characters in 'Byker Grove,' PJ and Duncan, shared a storyline, we became really close. We'd go out to the pictures, stay at each other's houses, have parties when family members were away.
- We love 'I'm a Celebrity,' 'Britain's Got Talent,' 'Saturday Night Takeway,' but they're all live shows.
- We've been in people's living rooms for a long time... It's lucky that 'I'm a Celebrity' and 'Takeaway' have been going on for so long that they trust us.
- I'd love to be able to play the piano.
- My dad left the family when I was about 10 and I've seen him sporadically over the years.
- There's this working-class guilt - you don't want to be flashy.
- We've done 'Britain's Got Talent' and we work well with Simon Cowell and have done for years.
- It takes me hours to get to sleep. I just lie there waiting, constantly thinking. I used to make lists, but it became addictive.
- We've seen people who have a 'make-under' just to try and recapture that Susan Boyle moment but it doesn't work like that.
- It's OK to take time off and say to friends that I need to get well.
- If you are enjoying yourself its infectious.
- I purposely, throughout the whole of my divorce, have not said anything publicly. I've not been on social media or put any of my personal views out there. It's not my style.
- You can't go through what I've been through without being humbled.
- I loved my Nintendo 64 growing up.
- It is brilliant to be able to say 'you have never had a holiday with your wife and your kids, here you go.' It is really lovely and heartwarming and we get to do it. It is lovely to get that opportunity. We remember them all.
- I've got an Aston Martin.
- If the whole of the industry is suffering it would be naive to assume we would not suffer too.
- With 'SMTV' it was a very brave decision by ITV to commission it for a year. It was so awful to start with and the ratings were so low to start with we might never have made it past the first six months.
- Entertainment is about having a blast.
- We struggle so much with wanting everybody to like us, we weaken ourselves at times.
- Anyone who suffers from depression knows once you're in it you're in it and you pretend to everybody till the last second of the day you're OK. Or you go the other way and don't leave the house.
- Katie Hopkins was in 'I'm A Celebrity' but you wouldn't really remember her doing it, as she didn't really shine.
- When you're bored, it doesn't necessarily mean the audience is bored.
- Loads of people thought we were gay.
- To be fair, life is too short. There is no point holding grudges or anything like that.
- Bake Off' will be a hit in Channel 4 terms but I don't think it will ever reach the heights it has on the BBC just because it won't. I love the show I am a big fan of the show, I think it is great.
- Obviously, the BBC is funded by licence-payers. If you are paying for a TV licence, when you see what people are paid, then you know you're funding that.
- What's annoying is we've launched a lot of shows like 'Pop Idol,' and then it goes to the States, and everything stays the same, yet they change the hosts. 'I'm A Celebrity' has been done twice in America now - but they changed the hosts. 'America's Got Talent,' we don't host - somebody else hosts.
- If you grow up poor, I'm not sure you ever shake that off.
- We're just grateful, we learn to be in moment and enjoy what we're doing.
- We left 'Byker Grove,' had a short recording career and suddenly it finished. The invites to premieres dried up and overnight things stopped. We realised very quickly how fickle this business is. Thinking you've lost it all makes you appreciate it a lot more and it sticks with you.
- In my job, having what they call 'popcorn thinking' is good because it means you can jump from one thing to another. Professionally it's brilliant. Personally I'm all over the place.
- Eighteen-year-old guys don't hang around youth centers, or if they do, they're kind of weird.
- I think you can show off too much, and that would have been such a no-no from me growing up.
- Our first flat, in South-West London, was a pig-sty. Dec couldn't even cook baked beans. We were like 'Men Behaving Badly.'
- On 'Takeaway' we wear these little earpieces because the show is live, but if you push them into your ear they go further into your eardrum and really hurt. One woman flung her arms around us and crushed my head so the earpiece went in. I nearly fainted. I lost my vision for a bit.
- It's a very hard thing to explain when we sit with writers on our shows. But then if they show us a sketch, instinctively we'd know who we'd play.
- I always read interviews with people and they say I was a right joker at school, I was a right loner at school - but I was just kind of average.
- We learnt a lot from doing Panto, actually back when we were still doing 'SMTV: Live.' We learnt how far we could push things and the show was all the better for that. I think that taught us you really have to know your audience because you could see how they would react to things.
- I remember Phillip Schofield saying to us, just before we started 'SMTV: Live'... 'It will be the best fun you will ever have on telly.'You know what the innocence and freedom we got on that show you don't get anywhere else. We could just mess about.
- In L.A. or New York, we don't fit. I think middle America could relate to us a lot, but we've never been given the opportunity to get out there.
- I would go into the Jungle if I wasn't hosting it or I'd like to do 'MasterChef.' But 'Strictly?' God, no!
- I'm just known as Ant and Dec, even when I'm on my own.
- We've always wanted to do things with kids with the surprise element that we do with celebrities, because their reactions are fantastic and sweet and charming and lovely.
- I need to be cared for and looked after. I need to be aware of things more and I am now.
- To feel love and give love - it's the greatest feeling there is.
- In our day-to-day lives we're not very introspective - especially not British northern blokes.
- Going back to school, having done 'Byker Grove' and being on the telly when you're 13, all the kids are very jealous and it can make it a quite hostile environment.
- I suffer really badly with insomnia.
- When we used to tour before we would stay in a Travelodge and had to share a room. One of us would have the bed and the other the pull-down sofa.
- I think if you are having fun the audience will have fun too.
- We have a show very early on called 'Slap Bang' on a Saturday night and it didn't work. It started off peak time and started getting earlier and earlier in the schedule. I think that that taught us you have to adapt.
- I'm just one of those people who happens to be all or nothing. A lot of people can be middle. I'm not.
- I've re-evaluated everything in my life.
- We did the original 'Pop Idol,' so I don't think we could go back to do a singing show.
