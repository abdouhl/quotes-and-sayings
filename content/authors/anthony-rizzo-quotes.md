- I will respect the limits of my experience but that won't stop me from trying to lead by example of my work. Being a good teammate and picking them up on and off the field is a simple goal of mine.
- I have to go with the approach I had in Triple-A. I need to take a lot of those fastballs I am seeing to left field. Also must gear up for the changeup and take them up the middle.
- One game, one pitch can change everything for a hitter. The way I like to approach it is that every at-bat is its own unique opportunity to go out there and do something really good.
- You obviously want the results but you must do your job in every at-bat and deal with what every situation dictates.
- Every day there is something new you are working on. It is a challenge every day and that is what makes this game so great.
- I don't believe a player is ever a finished product.
- I believe that everything you work at and want in life is a great challenge.
