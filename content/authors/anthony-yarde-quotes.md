- My contact with my dad's side of my family got less after we stopped living together, but they were in my life.

- I just say to myself I'm going to be a better fighter day to day. That's my thing.
- I'm an example of someone that's got a big physique but doesn't touch any weights. I used to, but I realized when I used to touch weights I'd get a lot of soreness and mobility issues, so I'd get up and my shoulder would be hurting, not only the muscle but around the joint.
