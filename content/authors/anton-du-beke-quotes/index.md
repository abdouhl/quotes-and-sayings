- If things don't go fantastically, you just have to deal with it.
- One day, I just wandered into a dance class full of girls, and that was it. I thought, 'Hang on! I'll have a bit of this.' I went back a week later and got dragged up by the teacher. It wasn't a massive calling.
- As soon as I left school at 16, I worked in a factory making aircraft components.

- I'm going for Britain's Best Dressed Man award, but strangely, I'm never on the list.
- 'Strictly' is a bit like scoring the winning goal in the FA Cup Final or sinking the final putt in the Ryder Cup - only a few people get the opportunity to do it, and they have got to be famous.

- As soon as I started dancing at 14, I knew I was always going to be a professional dancer.

- Bruce Forsyth is my hero, and the thought that I'd be in a TV show with him was incredible.

- I went professional with my partner, Erin Boag, 11 years ago, and we had success competing round the world, but appearing on 'Strictly' has changed my life.

- My father is Hungarian and moved to Britain during the uprising, and my Spanish mum comes from Galicia; they moved here at the end of the Fifties.
- Wherever I can get a fast track, I'll try to because I can't stand the airport experience. If you can afford priority boarding, then do it. Nobody wants an unpleasant experience before it starts.
- I get really very upset when I'm voted out, and I feel very disappointed.

- My perfect morning is spent drinking coffee, eating porridge and reading the paper at a local cafe.

- I always enjoy the process, meeting somebody new and spending time with them and becoming friends with them. That has always been the joy of 'Strictly' for me, so I enjoy every year.
- Too many multi-vitamins are packaged as one size fits all, but you should be more specific about what you need. When I was competing as a dancer, I took zinc for healthy skin and immune system.

- I've never worried about being rich or famous - for me, it's all about the dancing.

- So much illness is self-induced - which I can't stand. And I'm not a good nursemaid. Don't call me if you're ill.
- I remember watching the Three Tenors at the World Cup in 1990, and it was amazing. They made opera accessible to the man in the street.
- Since being involved in 'Strictly Come Dancing,' my life has changed completely. I can't walk down the street without women throwing themselves at me, I usually wouldn't mind, but they are of a certain age. Hopefully, after this series, they will bring their daughters!
- I know what I'm good at, and if I'm asked to do something I'm not - like hip-hop dancing - I get self-conscious.
- I do watch what I eat, but I don't make it myself. When I eat out, I just have to make sure the things I buy are good and healthy.

- Having been part of this wonderful show ever since series one, I know all too well what it's like to perform to the nation on the famous 'Strictly Come Dancing' dancefloor.

- I don't mind how good or bad my partner is, as long as we have a lovely time.

- As I grew up, I wasn't a great buyer of albums, but I really liked 'The Jam.' I like good musicians and loved the energy of their songs.
- I got sent some cheese once. I'm not sure if that was saying something about my act, or just because I like cheese.

- Life's supposed to be an adventure, a surprise!

- We didn't know anything about Judy Murray until we met her, but once we got to know her, we found she was an absolute scream.

- I work out in the gym three times a week on top of my dancing, so I have to eat a lot to keep my weight and energy up: a big breakfast, and little and often throughout the day.
- I'm happy to dance with anyone, to be honest. I've had some great partners, who have all been talented. But not all of them at dancing.
- Because we had no money when I was growing up, when I started dancing, I wasn't allowed to be frivolous - my mum made me go to every lesson because she was paying for it.
- At places like Chelsea, often the garden displays are so big and grand that you'd never be able to have them at home.
- With the media how it is these days, people expect to know everything. I don't talk about my girlfriend because essentially she doesn't want to be talked about.

- I was one of those people who just flitted about in life. I had no plans and no sense of direction.

- I've been playing golf as long as I've been dancing, since I was 13 or 14.
- I've become a produce snob. I like to eat food that's in season.
- I'm busier than ever and it's led to new opportunities. But I've never worried about being rich or famous - for me, it's all about the dancing.
- You spend your life having lessons, practising and competing as an amateur, and working during the day. As you get to the top end of the amateur field, you try not to work anymore; you earn your living through dancing, maybe by doing a bit of teaching. It's an ongoing life's work.
- I'm a bit of a traditionalist; the ballroom is all about tails and I never mess about with that. But for the Latin you can have a bit fun: tight trousers, gold shirt open to my waist, be a bit ridiculous.
- Being a competitive dancer is an expensive business - you have to buy the £2,000 or so tail suit and the shoes, and then get yourself around the world to the competitions. And there is not a lot of money to be made in competing.
- I wish I'd become a professional dancer sooner. I did other jobs - like baking - while dancing part-time, and didn't commit until I was 29.
- When I'm dancing with any woman, I immediately get rid of intimacy barriers. I just give her a big hug and crack on.
- You can't talk about yourself in the third party - that makes you a lunatic!
- I just get grumpy with bad behaviour.
- I hated most music in the 1970s, especially disco, but Bowie was edgier.
