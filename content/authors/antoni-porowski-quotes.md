- I'm definitely more of an extreme eater. I'm decadent on weekends and try to go plant-based during the week with a bit of fish - pescatarian thrown in.
- Polish people have a wit and sarcasm. They're gentle but still very strong. Like, they love beer, which is traditionally so manly, but they'll put a spoonful of jam in it to sweeten it up. They're this wonderful mix of hard and soft.
- My background is in psychology - that's what my bachelor's degree is from, and my specialization.

- I have experience more on the front-of-house side of things, but I've always had a strong reverence and a respect for chefs... they've always been sort of like my rock stars.

And I never had shame for it, but I never felt like introducing myself as, 'I'm Antoni. I'm gay. How are you?'

- On 'Queer Eye' I come in with what I know, and I try to parlay that into lessons for our 'heroes.' But that's really listening to what they need. Sometimes it's a little more ambitious. Sometimes it's very simplistic. But it's got to be something that's condensed into a short amount of time.
