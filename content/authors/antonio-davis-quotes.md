- I actually think some of the rappers can help our image, because the thing I'm concerned about is the NBA's image. I always want our image to be on the rise, and if the rappers can help young players get business-minded, then I'm all for it.
- I don't think I'll be playing again. I'm very content and happy, doing the types of things I haven't gotten to do, be a father.
- It's fool's gold if you are winning games and are not playing the right way.
