- Shakespeare is a permanent presence in the English letters.
- When I write short fiction or novellas, I like to leave a hint of the fantastic, of the unreal.

- A writer doesn't write about just anything. He writes about things he has an affinity for.
- Cervantes is the most important Spanish writer. But he is not the most representative of the Spanish. His irony, his sense of humor - they are too subtle to seem Spanish.

- As a writer, you live in permanent self-doubt; you're on permanent trial.
- People think that dreams are better than reality but this is not always the case; sometimes, because you dream too much, you are unable to see what you have in front of your very eyes.
- Nothing good ever happens by itself - it is achieved through striving, though this sometimes bears a high price.
- An idea like equality between men and women, which is now accepted in the West, is quite new.
- Many of the books I read, I had to read them in French, English, or Italian, because they hadn't been translated into Spanish.
