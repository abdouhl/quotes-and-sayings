- You have to strip people of their poses and disguises.
- I'm not a great one for chatting people up because it's phoney.
- The thing is, when you take photographs, you meet a lot of people but you don't actually know anybody. It is very quick, in and out, in a concentrated way.
- If you recognize a photograph by me, I'm a failure.
- My job is very simply that of a photojournalist. I want to stop people's eye on the page, I want to move the viewer to laughter, to sadness, sometimes to wince - not to impress other photographers.
- I always liked taking photographs.
- Photographs are things that should be pinned on a wall, and when you stop liking them - just tear them up!
- Young photographers must experiment all the time and not be frightened of using light - freely-shooting straight into the light if need be - making an effort to get new angles on much photographed subjects, and also discovering chemical properties of film itself.
- I really think the more talent people have, the more polite they are: Laurence Olivier and Alec Guinness always arrived on time and were impeccably behaved. It's only the gutter snipes who leave their lipstick on the studio floor - and that's just the men.
- I don't have a digital camera. I don't understand it - and I don't want to.
- First of all, I am not royal... and lastly, I am not royal. It's not appropriate.
- Photography is not a fine art at all.
- I can tell you what I personally use a camera for. Basically, it is to record a moment. A moment that is vital to give the viewer a sensation of liveliness, sadness, joy and so on.
- I didn't fall in love with boys - but a few men have been in love with me.
- I draw badly. Photography's much easier than drawing.
- I love Russian faces. The only difference between them is beautiful and more beautiful.
- I mean, taking photographs is a very nasty thing to do. It's very cruel.
- A still photographer is a mechanic. He's not an artist, despite all you read.
- I try to photograph with love and sympathy.
- A camera must be part of me - an extra limb capable of freezing a situation without complicated preparation.
