- I love playing outsiders, I always do.
- I'm a complete technophobe. I can't even email.
- When I'm painting and drawing I only do people. Acting is obviously portraiture - and writing is as well.
- What drew me to acting in the first place was disguise.
- I love the mixture that's in me. It makes me me. And that's why it's such a shame that people waste energy in denying who they are.
- When I am on a long run in a play, I'm not sure how I would fill the days if I did not paint or write. On a basic level, it just stops me going crazy.
- The whole of my acting career is a bit of a mystery to me.
- It's good for actors to confront those things we have to act: panic, pain and death.
- I was never built to play the hero. Physically or emotionally... And they're not as rewarding to play. At least for me.
- Life is just more comfortable if you're honest and open about everything. I spent so many years being in the closet about one thing or another.
- Most of my career has been spent with the RSC doing Shakespeare, and the thing you learn from Shakespeare is that his historical plays don't bear anything other than a basic resemblance to history.
- A lot of good actors tend to be quite introverted as people.
- As a gay Jewish white South African, I belong to quite a lot of minority groups. You constantly have to question who you are, what you are and whether you have the courage to be who you are.
- I believe deeply in therapy. There's no one in the world who wouldn't benefit from it.
- I feel so sorry for younger actors who aren't able to have the opportunities that I had, starting out in repertory theatre. It's really tough on young actors now.
- If I could write a letter to my teenage self, I'd probably say something like: 'You ain't gonna believe what will become of you.'
- I'm a huge fan of David Hockney. I love the way he keeps reinventing himself.
- My grandparents all came from Lithuania to South Africa.
- We've all got darkness inside us. And I've got quite a lot of darkness.
- I'm always very proud of belonging to three minorities: gay, Jewish, white South African.
- You don't expect to get the letter saying, Her Majesty would like to appoint you Knight Commander of the British Empire! It was just a completely overwhelming and exciting day.
- I never regret things. It's a really dangerous thing to say, but for anyone involved in the arts, the bad things that happen make for good material. It's not a comfortable truth, but it is true.
- Every play I do, every book I write, every painting I paint, I will struggle with. I don't know what it's like for a project to come easy.
- I was a weak kid, not good at what all the boys at school were good at and I found that by acting, by being other people, I could liberate myself from those inadequacies.
- I have a Woody Allen Jewish attitude to life: that it's all going to be disastrous. That it hasn't all been that way is simply down to some random quirk of fate.
- I have no cynicism at all.
- I don't believe in an afterlife.
