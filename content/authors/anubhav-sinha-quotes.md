- Any piece of art has the potential to emotionally touch you and nudge you.
- It is not a coincidence that we have managed to send rockets into space, but our literacy rate continues to be below the world average. It is because governments don't want an educated electorate.

- Till 'Mulk' and 'Article 15,' I used to deny that there is a change. Now I feel there is certainly a change, what kind of change, I don't know. Now I get attracted to different things - story or a performance. Earlier I used to get attracted to grand visuals, size of the film and how big the starcast was. Now I am not attracted to these things.
- I will continue to make films to express my thoughts that come from my observations, from the society we live in.
- As a filmmaker I have changed, yes. I seem to have crossed a line and that journey, trajectory change is more apparent. I'd say, what changed dramatically in me as a filmmaker is the fact that now, it is about why am I making the film, what is this supposed to mean to people. Earlier, it was more about entertaining or engaging them.

- No movie can change society, but there are things that can be achieved by a film. For example, we are sitting in a room that has a lizard in it but we don't mention it because it is not bothering us. But if I stand up and say there is a lizard in the room, then we will try to deal with it - in whatever way.
- 'Article 15' actually is not about the Dalits. It is about us privileged people. What is it that we have done, what is it that we have been doing and what is it that we should be doing?
- Cinema halls must be preserved by us and by the government. That business is in trouble today with monumental maintenance costs of idle machines and empty seats. When the crisis of the pandemic gets over and it is safe for all of us to go back to that experience we must, in hordes.

- In 1981, when I passed out of Class 12, you could either become a doctor or an engineer. If you did not take up Science in Class 12, you were not considered a good student. The Arts were a no-no.
- I don't think I have tried to give any message through 'Mulk.' But I have put certain things on the table which are usually discussed in the living rooms, not in our cinema.

- The people I met for the first time in the period when I was making films like 'Tum Bin,' 'Ra.One,' 'Dus,' 'Cash' would often remark that I was very unlike the person who had made those films. This is not the best thing for a film-maker to hear because your film should reflect your personality, thinking, philosophy and character.

- I feel 'Tum Bin' is a franchise where fresh actors are appreciated.
- In my profession, people are never scared to be nice. They are in fact apprehensive about being critical.
- Bob Dylan's 'Blowin' In the Wind' was written into the script of 'Article 15.' It was the only song I wanted in my film. It encapsulates the spirit of exploration and salvation that my hero Ayushmann Khurrana goes through. I love the song's lyrics, especially 'How many roads must a man walk down before you call him a man? '
- Social distancing on a film set is an oxymoron. It can't happen, it won't happen. We can keep lying to ourselves though.
- Cinema halls aren't just about movie watching. It's like watching a live match in a stadium with the crowd where you collectively share moments of joy and sorrow.

- I'm a workaholic and there is no other engagement in my life.
- I am now one of those people for whom the trolling never ends.

- 'Dus' was different from 'Tum Bin,' and 'Ra.One' from 'Dus,' but the difference didn't pop out as much as 'Mulk.' That was because it was an issue-based film and crossed the line as being a serious, hard-hitting movie.
- As a filmmaker, if your personality is not reflected in your movies, then what are you doing, why are you making films?
- In Delhi, I got a chance to assist someone on a documentary film. Then I moved to Mumbai. This was before the satellite TV. One had to assist a director for years before being able to direct a movie.
- I grew up in Banaras on Kabir and other Hindi poets and then I got introduced to Faiz, Hasrat Mohani, Allama Iqbal and Majaaz. They took me to another facet of literature and drama.
- 'Article 15' is an investigative drama where the audience too is an accused party.

- I keep finding good stories so I don't see a reason not to work.
- There's a big difference between chauvinism and chivalry.
