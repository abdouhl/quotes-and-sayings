- In Bengali films, since I also write the lyrics, there are certain songs, which I get emotionally and personally attached to.

- I learned tabla for three years when in school, then started picking up the basics of the acoustic guitar when in college.
- An artist is usually responsible only for the creation of a particular art. It's up to the critics to label it.
- On stage the spotlight is on me and I cannot afford to be shy.
- I have come to Kolkata to make music, but I can't expect one director to give me work all the time.

- Rock and roll is not just music, it is a way of life, it has its own spirit.
- I can contribute to the field of music, I would not have been able to contribute to the field of engineering.
- I try to talk as less as possible and maximise the music part. I have tons of songs on my set list and I want to sing all of them, or as much as possible. If I talk more it'll eat into the time allotted for me.
- On stage I try to be as spontaneous as possible, feeding off the energy of the audience. I just let myself be and have fun on stage.
- But what doesn't change is that love is something we all crave. Everyone is looking for that touch, that emotion, that feeling. Love makes the mundane matter.
- I take inspiration from my life but only twenty per cent is real the rest is all made up.
- Love songs too have many moods. It can be sad or be joyous and upbeat when one feels jubilant and in love.
- I think love songs are universal. It doesn't mean a particular kind of music. It can be happy, sad or even celebratory. Having a radio station dedicated to love songs make sense.
- I love playing football, and I'm pretty aggressive on the field. I'm a different person on the football field.
- There's workplace politics in Tollywood, like every other industry in the world. You just learn to deal with it.
- We can see the weather change, that the birds don't come to the city anymore... we seriously have to think about preserving nature.
- I got introduced to Western music and it inspired me. One of my favourite bands is Pink Floyd.
- When I was in college or working, I had the luxury of writing on whatever subject. Now, I'm in the business, I have a deadline and pressures. Sometimes, I have to do things that I am not in the mood for.
- Creativity is not about making 30 songs in 30 days. It's never about demand and supply. No one can possibly do that.
- I love the stage and try to balance it out with movies. If you take the stage away from me, then nothing will be left in my life.
- I have no such ambition of becoming an actor. I want to grow as a musician, singer and songwriter.
- See, I have two selves in me - a musician and a composer.
- I was always a wannabe 'singer-songwriter' but nothing was happening. I was trying for albums. I was too afraid to quit my job for nothing. But my friends kept on encouraging me. I kept on writing songs. My first hit was probably my 150th song.
- I compose melodies in my head and then interpret them musically with my guitar and keep them recorded. The guitar helps me to build unique chord structures on simple melodies.
- I believe in my kind of music and I'm happy to have reached out to people through my songs. My dream was to sing my compositions and get accepted by listeners.
- Everyone wants to be happy at the end of the day. If we can pursue what we really want to do, we don't get bored of life.
- I am not an established name in Bollywood and hence I can't call the shots. In Kolkata, I have proved myself and am in a position in the industry where directors and producers easily listen to me.
- But somehow I feel the world is taking me away from my original rock roots of inspiration. Rock and roll is losing its past glory.
