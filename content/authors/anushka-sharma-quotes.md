- Acting has always been my passion and will remain so.
- I always knew I wanted to be in films but didn't want anyone to taunt my parents. So I excelled in studies. I was a topper in school and college, so when I decided to become a model, people said, 'Oh your daughter is modeling,' so at least my parents could say, 'Yeah but she also came first in class.'
- Whenever I work on any Yash Raj film, I feel that they believed in me, and that's why I have been able to be in films today. I had no connection with movies apart from watching them.

- 'Jab We Met' is the reason why I have become an actress.
- I don't think I'm the best-looking actress around. I'm not Katrina Kaif; she is stunningly beautiful.

I'd like to believe actresses look better with experience.
- I tell myself that if I start to listen to these people and start to let them decide how I should behave and what I should do, then this is not my life - it's theirs.

- The stereotypes attached to Bollywood were that it's a big, bad world or that it's a dirty world.
- I don't like to talk about my personal life, so I will not talk about others. I don't give advice. I give advice to only my mother, father, and brother on health.

- It is very important for me that my clothes are comfortable and allow me to feel like myself and at ease.
- I didn't like when people said that actresses have shelf life.
- I don't want my guy to buy me cars, villas or diamonds. I can do all that. I don't want any PDA, either. But my guy should be very sensitive to my pains and sorrows and should try to make me happy because I'd do all that for him. Sadly, most of the men that I have met in the past couple of years are too self-obsessed.
- I feel things are changing now. Actresses are working at same pace even after getting married or having kids.
- When someone goes to watch my film in the theatre, they won't remember the last four articles they read about me. Instead, they will think about the last film I did.

- Nothing gives me more pleasure than acting. But I don't enjoy going for award functions or giving interviews.

- I find Tom Hardy very hot. About Bollywood actors, I dont think like that, as I know them.
- After I turned producer, people asked me, 'Why are you taking up production? You are still so young and doing well.' Just because an actress decides to make movies, do people assume that her career is not going well?
- It's difficult to judge yourself.
- I just got exposed to electronica, and I really liked it. I am also good with alternative rock. I like Lana Del Rey, Adele, Dido, Jack Johnson, and I love the Beatles and the Beach Boys.
- I can never be in the same place for too long. It feels like the world is caving in.
