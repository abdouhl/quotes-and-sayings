- They're my best friends. We think of Gigi as the brains in the family - something most of the world doesn't know - and my favorite thing about Bella is that she's a free spirit who never lets anyone set limits for her. They can be really protective, but they've taught me not to let other people define what I'm capable of.
- I think our family motto is to always work hard, be humble, kind, and thoughtful about others around us.
- Too many girls try to imitate others and don't think about what makes them unique. The best part of a girl is what makes her who she is as an individual.
- I try not to think about anyone's expectations but rather focus on always doing my personal best. Modeling was never a thought in my mind growing up, but my mom felt it was important for me to be open to business opportunities and expand my horizons.
- My family is my foundation. My sisters are awesome; they probably taught me everything I ever need to know about girls.
- I'm pretty shy, but if I like a girl, she'll know.
- My generation was born to work with social media - it's a natural part of our communication with the world.
- I'm comfortable around girls because I grew up with two sisters and a single mom. I feel very lucky for all they have taught me. They tell me to be myself, have fun, and focus on eye expressions.
