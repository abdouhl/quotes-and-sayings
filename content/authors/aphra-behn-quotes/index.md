- There is no sinner like a young saint.
- Money speaks sense in a language all nations understand.
- He that knew all that learning ever writ, Knew only this - that he knew nothing yet.
- Love ceases to be a pleasure when it ceases to be a secret.
- Each moment of a happy lover's hour is worth an age of dull and common life.
- Faith, sir, we are here today, and gone tomorrow.
- One hour of right-down love is worth an age of dully living on.
- That perfect tranquillity of life, which is nowhere to be found but in retreat, a faithful friend and a good library.
- Variety is the soul of pleasure.
- Nothing is more capable of troubling our reason, and consuming our health, than secret notions of jealousy in solitude.
