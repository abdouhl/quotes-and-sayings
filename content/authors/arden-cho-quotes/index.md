- I love 'BigBang'; I'm a huge 'BigBang' fan. I like G-Dragon, TOP, Taeyang, all the guys.
- If you are friends with someone, and you're like 'Hey, what ethnicity are you,' that's cool. But you wouldn't walk up to a white person and say, 'What kind of white are you?'
- 'Teen Wolf' has such a die-hard fan base, which we're all so grateful for. It's amazing to have that kind of support because, without the fans, we wouldn't have this show.
- Something I love about 'Teen Wolf' is that my character is written in as just a normal girl. She could have been any ethnicity; she doesn't have to be Asian.
- I always feel like people misunderstand the difference between an Asian story and an Asian-American story. That's completely different, too. I have friends who grew up in Asia, and our experiences are so different. Even though we might look the same, I feel like being Asian and then being Asian-American is completely different.
- I grew up watching 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' and used to dream that I would grow up to be just like her. In a way, 'Teen Wolf' has a lot of those kinds of characters. We're just kids by day, and yet we're trying to fight demons and werewolves and bad people and save people that we love.
- I've grown up with racism my entire life. I've been bullied, sent to the hospital, beat up, I've been called a Chink and a Gook. Every single racial slur an Asian person can be called, I've been called it.
- We grew up in Texas. We ate fried chicken and steak all the time. I didn't eat sushi until I was 24.
- I love Tamlyn Tomita, and I love Tom Choi. They're wonderful. They're fantastic people.
- I didn't know what it was going to look like or how anything was going to turn out, but the production on 'Teen Wolf' is so amazing. The way that they shoot it, edit it, and put it out there, it's really so exciting. I trust the team so much. They do such a good job.
- I think that's what we need more of: Asian-Americans on movie screens and TV screens where they're normalized. Where it's not about them being Asian or a person of color. It's just about them being a human. I think that's why sometimes when I see movies with an Asian family, but it's very stereotyped, I don't find that relatable.
- Ailee, to me, is just such a talented, powerful voice. She's sexy; she's beautiful. I'm a huge fan. I like her a lot. I really hope she keeps going at it. I really like her song 'I Will Show You.' To me, she has that Beyonce vibe.
- I'm so tired of people saying you have to look a certain way to be American.
- I really like IU... I just think she has the most adorable everything. Her voice is beautiful; she's talented at writing music, guitar, everything. I fell in love with her when I watched her on that drama 'Dream High.' That's probably when I first really fell in love with her.
- I just want to say I love Kira Yukimura so much. I loved my experience on 'Teen Wolf.'
- I'm a 2NE1 fan as well. I just love the YG Family!
- You can be more creative in acting by bringing your character to life and bringing a piece of you that wasn't there before. You could have five different actors play one role, and all five of them would be so different because each person brings a different piece of them into it.
- Initially, when I'd heard of 'Teen Wolf,' I had never actually sat down to watch the series. But during my audition process, before I had a clue that I would even be considered, I started watching the show to get a feel for it and to see what type of show it was.
- I love acting. Modeling is fun, too, but I feel like there is more room to stretch yourself and open yourself up to new experiences with acting. That's why I got into acting in the first place.
- I grew up in America - I was born and raised in Texas. I might look different, but at the same time, I'm pretty American.
