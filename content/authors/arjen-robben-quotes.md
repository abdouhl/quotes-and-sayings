- Statistically, I've done my best work at FC Bayern. I just feel really good here.
- Playing United is the sort of thing that really gets the best out of me.
- Van Gaal is the best coach I've had. We've got a very special relationship.
- If Mourinho loses 4-1, he doesn't sleep well.
- I've achieved everything in my career that I set out to - with the Champions League as the crowning glory.
- The best thing about football, and sport in general, is that if you suffer a big disappointment, then there is no better feeling than coming back the following year and doing well.

- I went abroad when I was 20, three years at Chelsea, a big club. Then two years at Madrid.
- Van Gaal is the kind of guy who can really make individual players better.
- You have to surprise opponents, keep them guessing. Doing the same thing over and over again without variation will not work.
- The football in Spain is more about skill and technique. Every team tries to play good football. The physical side, with plenty of running and hard tackling, plays more of a role in the Bundesliga.
- Bayern had no international success in the years before I joined, and my goal was actually to play at the best possible level, which would have meant winning the Champions League.
- You want to win all games, which means you want to win all cups and all prizes.

- I had injuries, but I didn't get them on purpose.
- Every game is a new battle.
- I guess my earliest football memories are of playing in the street and also the little pitches at school. I joined the local football team in my village when I was small, but we would play only once or twice a week. I honed my skills just by playing for fun with friends after school.
- As a team, you always need to show something extra in the Champions League.
- If I ever spat at an opponent, I'd never be able to show my face to my family ever again.
- I do not understand players going to China at the age of 27 or 28. Those guys are at the peak of their career. That is a waste, really. You only get one career. I sort of understand players who are already in their 30s.
- If you play at a world-class team like Chelsea, you have to perform every day.
- If you're at school, children who play football, you give everything to win... If you don't succeed, that's a huge disappointment. Then it's okay to be sad, but better times are coming.
- The appreciation between Bayern and I has always been there, from both sides. I know what I have at this club, and I always say that.

- Always, if you win prizes and are successful, of course expectations are higher, at Bayern especially.
- The most important thing is to stay down to earth and keep concentrating on the next game.
- In my youth-team days, I was always a left-winger who would stay close to the byline and put crosses in the box, so I could never cut inside and shoot. It was only when I joined Real Madrid and started playing in a more central position, and then on the right wing, that I suddenly realised I had a really dangerous weapon.
- The kind of money English clubs have available to spend is unbelievable. They buy everything they can.

- The best and most important step of my career was when I moved here - and Louis van Gaal brought me from Madrid to Bayern. It was the best move of my career, and it's thanks to him.
- Even during a sprint, I can occasionally still accelerate. I am so fit that I can accelerate during a acceleration, like making a new start.
- I'm not a diver. I know that.
- The most important thing for me is to feel that young players want to learn on the training pitch. If they spend 10 hours sitting around playing PlayStation, that's their business.
- Munich is a great city. I have lived in many cities in Europe, but I have never felt this comfortable, and my wife and children love it as well.
- I never had problems with injuries as a kid or in the youth team. My injuries started at Chelsea, when I broke my foot during a pre-season game. That was just pure bad luck, but after that, I had some muscular injuries, too, so I had to get to know my body better.
- When I came to PSV, I signed when Eric Gerets was coach there.
- When I'm fully fit, I have power and pace; then I feel good on the pitch.
- David Alaba has a very good left foot. He's scored some good goals and free kicks.

- I have lots of energy, but that doesn't happen like magic. I put in many extra hours in the gym and with the physios.
- I don't know if referees look at me differently; you'd have to ask them. I hope everybody gets treated the same, but I know that it doesn't always happen.
- When I met Mourinho, I was still very young, but mentally and tactically, he worked on me. He was really demanding: you could not take a step below your level.
- I think I had a positive development at Chelsea. I was very young when I arrived, only 20, and the problem I had was injuries.
- I enjoy working with the younger players and helping them to develop.
- Maybe sometimes you are punished for honesty, but I always prefer to be honest.

- A break in the middle of the season is good for everybody.
- I have always said that I do not want to play in the Europa League.
- I will always be the first to admit when I have done something wrong.
- I've been playing football for a while, but Guardiola really made me a better player. I was 29 when I started working with him, so I wasn't very young, but if you see the steps I made thanks to him, it shows you what he is capable of doing. Guardiola didn't just put me on the flanks but in other positions as well.
- Selfishness is a quality and not necessarily a bad thing.
- Every league has its own culture, its own identity, and its own type of football. It's very physical in England, but technical skill comes to the fore in Spain, where everybody wants to play beautiful football. The standards are very high in Germany, too; the teams are physically strong, very disciplined, and very well organised.
- The older you get, the better you get to know you body.
- In my period at Chelsea, I was sometimes the one who switched sides because we were playing with two left-footed guys on the wings with myself and Damian Duff.
- Some referees have to think about treating every player the same, even if it's Ronaldinho or another player from a Premiership club. It doesn't matter how good you are: you have to be treated the same.
- Losing drives me mad. It hurts.
- Attackers have to be selfish on the pitch occasionally, but it's important not to exaggerate.
- You need to be very critical of yourself. There are a few very good managers who can make players better individually. Most managers think about the team process - and so you have to improve things on your own.
- Players come and go, and that goes for coaches as well.
- I just know that I love football,and when I'm on the pitch, I want to win.

- What I will miss the most about Guardiola? His obsession with the game and his knowledge, which makes you a better football player.
- I'm a very explosive player and need everything to be right. I started working with an osteopath the last year I was in Madrid and have stayed with him.
- In a top team, you always have very big competition between players, and for me, that's not a problem at all.
- A backheel is good if it works, not if it disrespects the opponents.
- It is important that it - sometimes there are clashes between team-mates. We need each other to tell the truth, and this is not always a positive.
- I'm always a realist, and I know the world of football is fast-moving.
- There's always so much to improve, no matter your age.
- We have to respect the opponents.
- When we are in possession, tactically, he is the best coach in the world for me. He works hard, watches a lot of games, and prepares us really well. Guardiola has the feeling for gaping spaces, and he already had that as a player.

- Since I've been at Bayern, I have seen the Bundesliga grow.
- Every new coach is interesting.
