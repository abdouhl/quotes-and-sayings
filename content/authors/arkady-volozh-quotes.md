- Yandex originated from a company called Arkadia, which created two search programs under the DOS operating system in 1990.
- We never set up Yandex to imitate what others were doing. We've been in the business longer than other search engines and have created many original products.
- When you travel around Moscow, you can see almost every car is using a smartphone where they can see what's ahead of them.
- I think Yandex is something in between two different cultures. One originated from the old Soviet culture of the scientific institute. It was a free atmosphere of scientists, maybe too free because nobody cared about making money. Another origin is something close to what you usually see in California startups.
- Russia has to have a technology company of global meaning sooner or later. We should take the depth of technical culture we have here and make it available worldwide.
- Any good business is a hobby. We have an integrated company culture, and I can honestly say that many people who come here to work make Yandex a central part of their lives.
