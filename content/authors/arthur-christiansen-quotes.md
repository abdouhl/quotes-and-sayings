- News, news, news - that is what we want. You cannot beat news in a newspaper.
- Good stories flow like honey. Bad stories stick in the craw. A bad story? One that cannot be absorbed on the first time of reading.
- We never waste space saying, 'On the one hand.' We just state an opinion in a Godlike voice.
