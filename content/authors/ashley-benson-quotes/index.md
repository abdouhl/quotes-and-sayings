- I was on the soap opera 'Days of our Lives.'
- I love Rihanna's new album, Skrillex, and Norah Jones. They're are all very different, but I love any rock, pop, and jazz.
- I don't want to be with someone boring because I'm always laughing. I like to play jokes on people and be sarcastic.
- I love jeans, T-shirts, boots, and tennis shoes.
- I know what it's like to be left out... I certainly went through a period of time where I got made fun of and people were so mean to me, so I can really relate to that.
- When I was younger, I went through a lot of different phases. One day I'd be punk rock, and the next I would be tomboyish, and then I would be really girly. I was so weird. My two best friends and I were just crazy and goofy!
- Faviana is a line that girls can feel super-glamorous in. A lot of their designs are kind of based off of what celebrities wear on the red carpet!
- I always get offered the pretty, popular girl roles, but I want to do something dark, really challenge myself and get out of my comfort level.
- I love doing comedy.
- Everything I do is unfabulous. I'm the most normal person. I love walking everywhere and going to hole-in-the-wall places, like nail shops, because they do the best job. And I go to vintage stores rather than high-end boutiques, because I like to dress different from other people.
- My first celeb crush was Hanson. I loved all three of them. My sister and I would always fight, and whenever they would come on the TV, we would always give them a kiss on the TV. And I also had a crush on Jonathan Taylor Thomas. Every time he would come on the screen, he was like my boyfriend. I was such a nerd like that.
- I love good old-fashioned black or white Converse. I have a few pairs. And they are all really dirty. I can't have clean Converse - I go in the dirt and run around!
- I don't think I could live with anybody. I had roommates, and it's not for me. I like my space!
- I had a gothic phase, and now I'm more edgy chic.
- I was a good student, but I didn't like school.
- I love guys who know how to dress. I love the motorcycle boots, and I love the skinnier jeans with jackets and scarves. Anybody who gets his clothes at All Saints, that's my guy.
- My beauty icon is Angelina Jolie.
- I have one good girlfriend and then most of my friends are guys. Which I love, because they're just like so easygoing and I love to play like Xbox and just chill out when I'm not working, so boys are probably the way to go for me.
- My skin is really sensitive, so I don't use too much on it. I'm actually really bad at washing my face. I get so lazy at night so I usually buy the Neutrogena wipes and it gets all the makeup off and its easy and that's the way to go. I hate washing my face, so I always use the wipes.
- A lot of sequins for New Year's! Red, green, white - I fail at all of that because I'm always in black. But for Christmas, I do love wearing cute dresses with tights and a pair of boots.
- People will make mean comments. People are going to say that you're fat, that you're this, that you're that. You just have to be comfortable in your own skin.
- I love Michelle Williams and Natalie Portman - those are the careers I want. My goal is to win an Oscar, and I'm going to take the steps to get there.
- Boys like it when you're mean. That's what I'm best at. I make them feel so bad about themselves, all out of fun.
- I get really cool gifts, and I know this sounds really lame, but I think one of the best gifts I've ever received was the Easy Bake Oven when I was younger. When I was little, I loved to bake! I want to get one now so I can make weird mini desserts for people.
- This sounds crazy, but my goal is to be nominated for an Oscar. I was the kid who was practicing my acceptance speech when I was ten.
- I've seen a lot of people - for example, Lindsay Lohan - who got into the wrong crowd. I always have my eye on what I want. And I don't want anything to distract me from that.
- I pretty much like all music except for country. I'm not a big fan of country.
- I didn't go to high school, but when I did go to school, I was actually in the group made up of cheerleaders; I just wasn't one of them. But I hung out with a bunch of different kids.
- When I was little I used to dance and model and that was fun. But I was always the person that was goofing off and I would memorize every line in every movie that I saw. And at recess that's what I would do, I would talk to my friends and recite movies.
- I like edgy but classic looks - like Chanel mixed with Alexander McQueen. My personal style is edgier. My closet is just black, gray, and white. I'm more comfortable in darker colors and leather jackets.
