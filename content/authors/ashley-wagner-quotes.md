- In 2010, I was 17 or 18 and thought, 'Yeah, the Olympics, that might happen.'
- I by no means quit social media.
- I went through my awkward teenage years. I don't want to go back.
- Yu Na Kim, Mao Asada, Carolina Kostner - all these girls can do triple-triples in their sleep, and they have the skating skills and the spins and the rest of the technical jumps. So I have to have that as well if I want to be able to call myself 'competitive' against them. And when I say 'competitive,' I mean I want to win.

- I love Pinterest! Pinterest is absolutely phenomenal when you're trying to come up with a costume design.
- I always loved Michelle Kwan's outfits. Most of them were designed by Vera Wang, and they're just so simple, but the fabric that they used and the way that it was sewn together look so elegant and rich.

- I want to stay involved in sports in one way or another.

- I try to stay low-carb and high on lean protein. I'm lucky in that I love chicken and rice; it's one of my favorite meals. I steam some vegetables and top them with olive oil for some flavor.
- I hate doing Tabatas - you do whatever you want at high intensity for 20 seconds, and then get a 10 second break and you repeat that for 8 minutes. So you can do jumping jacks for 20 seconds, you can do sprints for 20 seconds, etc. It's supposed to help you get your endurance up really fast.
- When I do my makeup, it kind of helps me get into the character that I'm trying to portray.
