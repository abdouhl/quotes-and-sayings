- As a team, we have a lot of work ahead of us in FY16 and beyond, but I am confident that, working together, we will make Microsoft a leader in the mobile-first, cloud-first world.
- For commercial customers, we have invested in specialist mobile-first sales capabilities, and we are building out our device-selling channel.
- We actually believe Windows 8 is the new era for the PC plus. We believe with a single push of a button you can move seamlessly in and out of both worlds. We believe you can have touch, a pen, a mouse, and a keyboard.
- We have been investing in building a mobile-first selling capability by establishing the Consumer Channels Group to strengthen and align the device-selling motion and to expand our impact with OEM, retail channel partners and our operator channel, and by extending it with our opening of Microsoft Stores.
- When I talk about that Apple ecosystem, the ability to get one application to run across those five platforms is very difficult. In the future of Microsoft, using HTML5, IE9 and 10, the scalable OS, the ability to do that gets much, much easier.
- We believe that Apple has it wrong: they've talked about it being the post-PC era, they talk about the tablet and PC being different; the reality in our world is that we think that's completely incorrect.
- The reality is the world's shifted; the world's evolved. We now measure ourself by total device space. We have a much bigger opportunity than we've ever had in the past to grow our business, but we have to rethink how we look at our business.
- I'm a competitive person by nature, and I have been in competitive companies, and I love to compete - joining a company where, certainly, there is a real fire in the belly to compete and bring that energy is something I look forward to.
- Citadel is a global technology leader, recognized for its work to level the playing field for investors and make markets more fair, transparent and efficient. I look forward to leading this exemplary team as we grow this global business.
- If you bet on Microsoft, you are not going to ask anymore, 'Hey, where is the innovation?' The challenge going forward is how do we keep up with it.
- It's so exciting to be able to talk about Office 365. I can only describe what Office 365 is in sort of two words. You could say technically it's three words. But Office 365, ladies and gentlemen, is nothing but a Google butt-kicker, that's all it is.
- To align with our new strategy to enhance the Windows device ecosystem, we are integrating Microsoft Mobile Device Sales (MMDS) underneath the Consumer Channels Group (CCG).
- Going forward, we will focus on building the very best Windows phones on a quicker timeline. We will also focus on the channels and markets that offer the best returns. This is a similar approach to the one we have taken with Surface, which has been very successful.
- Phones remain a critical component of the Microsoft device portfolio and an important piece of our mobility strategy, but a restructuring is in order.
- Apple makes great hardware. The reality is, in the OS, we see things differently.
- We've got a great value proposition against Chromebooks, we are not ceding the market to anyone.
