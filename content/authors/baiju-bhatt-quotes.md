- Brighter Than a Thousand Suns' by Robert Jungk and 'Surely You're Joking, Mr Feynman!' by Richard Feynman were both books my father purchased for me when I was in high school. Both left a lasting impression on me, because they chronicle the lives of some of the most creative scientists of the 21st century.

- It's really, really, important that this country as a whole trusts its financial system.

- I think the customers that Robinhood will get at the beginning are younger, smaller accounts that are too hard for Schwab and E-trade to make money off anyway. They've neglected that market.

- We fundamentally want to make people's lives simpler. So we will look for technology that works toward that end.
- I don't think there's a particular technology that will set the trajectory for us moving forward. We don't want to be one of the companies that say AI is the next big thing, let's go build an AI application for Robinhood. That might not work. It might be awkward.
- The financial services industry is failing the millennial generation.
- Our move to offer free options trading is rooted in the belief that sophisticated investment tools don't need to be complex or reserved for the wealthy.
- If I walk down the street wearing a Robinhood T-shirt, I get ambushed. It's kind of weird.
