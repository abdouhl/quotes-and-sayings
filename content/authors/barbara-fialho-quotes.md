- I've learned about ice water in the morning - when you wake up tired, or you're jet lagged and you've been flying and your skin is dry, or you have puffy eyes - the ice water really helps cool the face down and helps circulation.
- I lived in Paris for four years, so I am obsessed with pastries. Croissants, pain au chocolat, cakes, macarons, all of that!
- I'm not very into pastas or heavy foods like meat, but pastries, especially if they come from a really nice French bakery, I go crazy over! I try to allow myself those little treats in the morning for breakfast, then I have a lighter lunch.
- I don't usually have facials.
- I am very, very strict with my workout regimen; not so much with my food, because I'm always working out, so I can allow myself to be a bit more naughty!
