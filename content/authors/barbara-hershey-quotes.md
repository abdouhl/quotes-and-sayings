- I just think Australia tends to make very good movies, so if someone hands me an Australian or an American film script I would guess the Australian film would be more intriguing.
- I loved that it was about human relationships and then it was a mystery without falling into the trap of a thriller per se, because it pulled you in through people rather than through events or effects.
- I know actors come around and they always talk like that, but I don't do publicity if I don't like the film.
- I am not afraid of aging, but more afraid of people's reactions to my aging.
- Yes, it was love at first sight. I feel that after all these years, I have finally found my soul mate.
- It's also very painful, because I feel, and I know, probably all women my age and older feel like we're better and have more to give and are more fun now.
- That's what everyone said attracted them to Lantana - I call it an adult mystery, because it's not a thriller in the sense of that other way, but it is a mystery.
- Sydney's a beautiful city. It was a great experience.
- I look back on my life like everybody does but not just career. I mean I look back on my life as a whole, so I don't think that I dwell there or anything and in terms of work I hope that there is a lot in front of me.
- So I was always passionate about it and felt that it was sort of the golden thread inside me in terms of what I was supposed to do in terms of work but I think I have relaxed a lot in terms of the actual experience and actually enjoy it more and enjoy the people more.
- I like the sensibility of Australian film a lot and the crews are fantastic. Great characters, wonderful people and no line between - I think in Hollywood they have this line between actors and crew a lot, and that just didn't exist, which I really appreciated.
