- There are those who believe that the value of a children's book can be measured only in terms of the moral lessons it tries to impose or the perfect role models it offers. Personally, I happen to think that a book is of extraordinary value if it gives the reader nothing more than a smile or two. In fact, I happen to think that's huge.
- All of my characters are less than perfect.
- Society just has a way of inhibiting you, which is good and bad.
- Ever since I began writing my Junie B. Jones series, people have been assuming that the character is based on me when I was a little girl. The fact is, though, that Junie B. and I have very little in common.
- For 20 years I've gotten to laugh my way through my work. For me, that's a dream job.
- My own pregnancies were all about me, me, me. My aches, my pains, my swollen feet, and my body that looked like the Michelin Man.
- My criteria for what makes a book an official 'favorite,' is based almost entirely on how desperately I don't want the story to end.
- I'm so lazy as far as liking to get up, go to the office in my pajamas, get dressed about noon. And I hate flying. So I have this really laid-back, good lifestyle, and it's hard to nudge me out of it.
- I find that when I'm struggling to think of how a six-year-old would feel about something, I just have to go right down to the common denominator, find the simplest way that you can look at an object or a problem, and not muck it up with all of the stuff that adults do and over-analyze.
- I like to think that Junie B. looks at the world - and this isn't a negative comment on her - from the lowest common denominator. It's not all gray to her; it's all black and white.
- I've stopped reading about my books on the Internet because it's too hurtful.
- Of all the novels I've written, my favorite is 'Mick Harte Was Here'.
- My senior year of high school, I was voted 'Wittiest.' So, several years later, I decided to try my hand at writing humor to see if I could be witty enough to make some money.
- I find the term 'perfect child' to be an oxymoron.
- There are many reluctant young readers who haven't yet found books that make them laugh.
- I was a good kid, but I was just very chatty. Teachers were rarely entertained, but occasionally a child was, which was enough for me. Everything was so urgent. I needed to say it immediately.
- I wasn't that over-the-top, but I got sent to the principal in first grade for talking. And my father was for a long time the president of the Board of Education. That was always a hard note to bring home.
- I'm not actually sure I'm grown-up enough for grown-up books.
