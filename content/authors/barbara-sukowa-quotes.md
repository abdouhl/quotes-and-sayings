- I would like people to get a differentiated historical view of Germany.
- I am what I am. I'm not going to get plastic surgery. I had this discussion with my younger son. We were at a dermatologist, and this dermatologist suggested to me that I wanted to avoid wrinkles.

- I started to read labels around age 18 or 19. I don't buy things that don't sound like food, and I've been that way all my life. I do go through phases, during which I eat meat for maybe three months then don't. I do eat lots of vegetables. It's the same with dairy - I'll eat it then stop.
- They wanted me to do movies and television when I was very young, and it was a big temptation, but I really thought the only way I could learn the profession was on the stage.

- You can only be a monster if people let you be a monster.
- I think it's important for politicians to have moral qualities.
- I always had acting work when I needed it. I think that is why, when I watch films or TV series in America, I find in small roles or in supporting roles really amazing faces, where I have the feeling these people have actually had a life outside of acting. I find it almost a pity that I've never done anything else.
- I could imagine actually being a scientist or a detective, but not a detective who puts his hands into gory, bloody things. But more like someone who figures things out. I like to figure things out.

And he said, 'Well, I'll read it with you.' Which was very nice; he was the director. And I ended up getting the part.
