- The truth is that every news channel is a variant of the other and the difference is one of degree.
- The working conditions of Indian labourers in the Gulf countries are notoriously abusive.
- Much like the death sentence, I believe, hidden cameras should be used in the 'rarest of rare' cases.
- We can barely deal with men who set their own rules; to ask us to accept a woman who is individualistic, passionate, beautiful and yes, possibly annoyingly arrogant, makes us just a little nervous.
- Modi's masterstroke has always been to blur the battlelines and construct an artificial enemy one that plays into primal instincts of pride and insecurity.
- Nostalgia can be an awful bore, especially for those whose memories are painted in hues different from ours.
- The BJP promised that the end of Article 370 was going to be the close of business-as-usual in Kashmir. But if anything defines business-as-usual, it has been New Delhi's attempts at political engineering in the Valley.
- Even those of us who do not understand the nuances of economics have come to accept that reform cannot be bloodless. We are often impatient with the predictable, do-gooder campaigns against development. We argue passionately against the humbug protests of those who never want the poor to get rich.
- This Right vs Left fault line has been drawn through all of our nations. In India too, your political choice has come to define all of you. And if you fail the ideological purity test of one or the other side, you are immediately branded a traitor.
- Every time that zealots clash with the zany and Religion and Freedom take opposite positions across the trenches, the issue becomes larger than the individual.
- It's never said out aloud, or in so many words, but for many urban, upper caste Indians, 'the backwards' are precisely that - citizens of the hinterland, ungainly and otherworldly - an inconvenient blemish on their shining, gleaming future.
- If the travels of a country were to be chronicled by its cars, in the journey from the Ambassador to the Nano is, perhaps, the story of India's evolution as a nation.
- I feel unabashedly Indian, and this means that not just do I jump to my feet and sing along with the national anthem, it also makes me inexplicably sentimental, proud and teary-eyed.
- When Hindustan Motors rolled out the first Ambassador Car in 1957 its sturdy body, rounded contours and Mother Earth simplicity immediately bagged it a place in our collective consciousness.
- No matter what you think of him otherwise, there are no two ways about it - Narayana Murthy is inextricably linked to the modern Indian's sense of self. So also is Sachin Tendulkar. Every time he goes out to bat, he carries with him the dreams of a billion people. Like many sporting legends, he is an iconic symbol of our subliminal nationalism.
- For decades, the Left has occupied a special place in the minds of educated Indians - outside of the two states (Bengal and Kerala) where it has a political presence and is therefore treated like any other political party.
- For the Modi government, the calls for a 'Naya Kashmir' has paradoxically led them right back to old established political parties after a failed experiment at propping up an 'alternative' regime in the form of the Apni Party and other such flirtations.
- Most of us will agree that my former medium, television news, has been reduced to tawdry entertainment.
- Grief, like Covid-19, mutates and escapes the inoculation of both time and the reassurance of loving friends. It is less sledgehammer and more screwdriver, drilling little holes in your head and heart, leaving you haunted by the ifs and buts of your decisions.
- If we began deconstructing the myths at the heart of every religion, we would be citizens of a Marxian Utopia.
- The rise of Right-wing populism globally has divided not just countries, but families. It has broken relationships and torn apart friendships. It has created social media discord and abuse, and led to unprecedented name-calling.
- Hinduism especially - in the absence of codified rituals or a book of rules to circumscribe it - has always functioned as part philosophy, part mythology, leaving it open to competing and contradictory interpretations.
- The Christianity of the St Stephen's College I remember was atmospheric (how we loved the chapel, the choir and the Cross), cultural and entirely subtle.
- What we take away from our school and college years is especially personal and rarely transferable to someone standing outside that circle of experience.
- Flight attendants need to think on their feet and walk on their toes. An emergency landing can't be steered by a pot-bellied cabin crew that crawls or belly-walks.
- Politicians know that as public opinion learns to assert itself more aggressively, a government that goes against a presidential opinion can find itself on the defensive.
- The fact is that a ghastly class prejudice defines our response to the Indian Diaspora.
- The freedom of expression cannot be defined selectively.
- A message you abhor has to be trumped with a more powerful one.
- You cannot hurl textbook principles of right and wrong in the age of fake news, WhatsApp campaigns and personality-centric cult politics. Elections are not a moral science class.
- No one wants to trivialise the gigantic challenge of battling terrorism or undermine the sacrifice of our soldiers and policemen.
- The crests and troughs in Covid-19 cases and the spikes and falls of daily infographics by which we now measure the wellness of our lives have been based mostly on city-driven data.
- What people, both while voting or while watching television, seek is the same - to know what you stand for and whether you can tell a story that captures their imagination and holds their attention.
- We like to say we would never want anyone we care about to suffer. But is it because it's we who cannot see them in pain?
- I don't care if a flight attendant is fat as long as she doesn't sneak back to the galley for a gossip when she should be pushing down the food trolley. I get annoyed when the food trays are slapped down on my seat by bored and disinterested men and women. I look for warmth and comfort, not cold efficiency.
- There is an undeniable need to stop candy-flossing the impact of fundamentalism.
- Hindi news is much more determinedly populist and lowbrow than the English channels.

- The sanctimony that a section of the media wears like a second skin comes undone so fast when the scrutiny is on them.
- There are only a handful of educational institutions that can be called emblems of a Thinking India.
- Even atheists and agnostics - and I'm an agnostic - can respond with respect to the cultural infiltration of religion into our everyday lives.
- Covid-19-affected patients cannot be orphaned.
- When Sania Mirza says she feels hurt or fed up at constantly grabbing the headlines for the wrong reasons, it's an understandable reaction. But when she goes ahead to say she doesn't want to play in India anymore, we can't help thinking it's the sort of thing you'd expect a defeatist to say.
- In 2020 we saw the poorest Indian citizen suffer as migrant workers, in the hundreds of thousands, fled the cities on foot, sometimes barefoot, to return to the villages.
- I don't watch television news and, so, whatever I know is from online snippets released by various channels.
- Politics is Darwinian. Individuals will prioritise their future first.
- When passion turns to paralysis, when our bodies stop listening to our brains, when a fatal disease sucks our insides out, will we then decide that death may well be an act of kindness?
- There comes a time in the life of every government when the media decide that it has blundered so fatally that a complete recovery is now impossible. In such phases - and every single political party has encountered them - editorials become political obituaries that declare the end.
- Much has already been said about the indisputable integrity of men such as AB Bardhan and Prakash Karat. So, why is it that while the sleaze and slime of the political underbelly puts us off, we aren't warmed by the relative virtue and scrubbed-clean morality of the Marxists?
- We must first be able to look honestly at fundamentalism in our own backyard, if we are to have any hope of weeding it out.
- What other, newer democracies find relatively easy - conducting an election, the counting of votes, the peaceful transition of power - seems to have befuddled the United States (U.S.).
- For a man once called the Indian Obama by the historian and public intellectual Ramachandra Guha, the diminishing of Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar could not be more dramatic.
- People care when service is sluggish and comes from an arrogance and complacency that often besets those who know they can never lose their jobs.
- If there is a bulwark against the BJP juggernaut, it can only be India's regional parties. But they too falter in the face of the Modi factor and their own lack of commitment to a full time, 365 days a year, 24-hour-a-day political life.
- I am not a pundit or a psephologist and thus not in the business of calling elections.
- India cannot pretend anymore that none of its citizens fancy membership to the Global Jehad club. We need to examine where our secularism has failed.
- Every institution of India - politicians, journalists and corporate chieftains - comes within the purview of the judiciary but when it comes to auditing their own conscience, judges want everyone else to stay out.
- The real challenge to upholding India's freedoms is how patchy and individual-driven it is when it comes to the judiciary. The system is so arranged that instead of legal precedent and case law setting the template for the court's interventions, the idea of justice is guided by what Judge A or Judge B may think.
- As women, many of us have internalised our lives as a prolonged version of boot camp, a sort of Darwinian call to toughen up or perish. As young women, we are terrified that men we consider our mentors can turn out to be monsters.
- Patriotism need not be puritanical.
- The hysterical competitiveness in the media bazaar has subverted the traditional hierarchy of news.
- Neither scientific laboratories nor excavation expeditions can unravel the human need to believe in a greater truth, a truth strangely made all the more grand and mysterious by the absence of empirical evidence.
- I am not a big fan of politicians turning tragedy into opportunity, but I believe that which politician a victim's family wants to meet is entirely their decision.
- Whether it's Delhi, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana or Odisha, we have seen similar patterns - hostile local politics transform into conciliation of some kind after the state elections.
- The BJP brand of Hindutva was originally rooted in middle-class disenchantment with secular hypocrisies; Modi's version is defined simply by hard-edged hatred.
- Much of India's Hindu-Muslim divisions can also be located in the context of history, fomented further by the politics of divide and rule.
- The army's original job description was to protect borders, but a demanding country depends on it for everything else too, from rebuilding bridges after a tsunami to keeping the peace when religious riots erupt.
- In a country like ours where the poor barely have the right to live, a legally recognised right to die would push them to the very margins of healthcare services.
- Most of us in the media are, by and large, sentimental about our national identity, but comfortable enough in our skins as Indians, to be deeply self-critical. The problem arises when loyalty to India gets mixed up with loyalty to the government of the day.
- In countries like the U.S., the courts have upheld the right to burn the national flag as a mark of protest or expression. In India, by contrast, we routinely get hysterical if the flag is ever taken out of the boundaries of officialdom.
- An idea you disagree with has to be fought with a better idea.
- Wherever I go, people complain about what they see on television. Yet, if you are lapping this up because it's random entertainment or from morbid fascination, you are enablers.
- Women - whether in politics, media or business - can't have it both ways. We can't demand to be judged irrespective of our gender if we also plan to manipulate our sexual identity to our advantage. We can't both play the game and pretend to be sitting it out. We can't deliberately act 'female' and complain about male bias.
- Most of us marvel at the ingenuity and imaginativeness of sting operations, defend their right to exist and will argue that if well-used, they are an invaluable tool for justice.
- I'm not a big fan of government interference in most matters.
- In many professional spaces, women are fighting twice as hard as men to get to the same place and get the same opportunities. If you then speak out about your experience of sexual harassment, there is every chance you will not be sent on certain assignments.
- We do not have to be trapped in the simple-minded binaries of the western world.
- A hidden camera can only be a good journalist's last resort. But sometimes, it's the only option.
- If anything, I believe, television anchors have become parodies of themselves, self-caricatures if such a thing is possible. And I'd dismiss it all with a scornful laugh if broadcast news were not so dangerous in fanning misogyny, communalism, fake news and divisiveness.
- Yes, fear and repression may be permanent citizens in Narendra Modi's Gujarat.
- For the BJP, the conversion of Bengal's cultural Hindu into a political Hindu is a long-standing project.
- Apart from democracy, globalisation and economic liberalism is our 20th century area of commonality with the U.S., the burgeoning numbers of skilled Indian workers in the U.S. and the outsourcing of American jobs to Indians who never even had to leave their desks, makes us feel that the relationship can eventually be a two-way street of equals.
- A hidden camera must never become a lazy substitute for the rigours of old-style reporting.
- It has become impossible for India to talk about caste with any candour.
- If the airline industry were to evolve a common fitness standard for both male and female employees, that would not just be acceptable, it would be entirely desirable.
- You can't define yourself either in shades of what you are contesting or entirely in antithesis to it. By doing so, what you reveal is that you have nothing to say for yourself. Or that you are unsure of your messaging.
- India's middle-class knows better than most how hard and lonely the struggle of an ordinary man can be.
- Politics, by definition, is risk averse. Perhaps that's why America was so awestruck when Barack Obama ended the Black vs White debate by painting his political canvas in shades of grey.
- National security is that old rabbit that's pulled out of the hat every time politicians run out of other tricks to keep you in check.
- If you leave out the magnetic stardom of sportsmen and actors, middle-class India today really has just two heroes - the army and the judiciary.
- In many ways, Ahmed Patel was the mind of Sonia Gandhi. Nearly everything we know about her publicly was constructed or revealed with his enabling.
- Textbook journalism everywhere in the world has always frowned upon the sting as a tool of reporting.
- We will unconditionally worship Rahul Dravid and Sachin Tendulkar, partly because we approve of their well-mannered modesty. They are non-threatening, good hearted blokes - the boys we take home to Momma.
- Parts of India treat Rushdie like he's a rock star; we especially like boasting about him to our Western friends and acquaintances. It's nice to act like one of the world's most successful authors is as homespun as our handloom saris.
- Our ideas of consent have evolved and changed because feminism has pushed the boundaries.
- For too long now we have watched the Left perch prettily on the periphery of the government, enjoying influence without accountability. In the two states where it has actually had to deal with the everyday reality of governance, look at how the Chief Ministers have struggled to marry textbook diktats with the actualities of a Changing India.
- My father, a former Air India official, but essentially an inventor at heart - a man who loved to sometimes break machines just so that he could have the joy of re-engineering them - was a twinkly-eyed, ever-optimistic man of science.
- To call the coronavirus a great equaliser turned out to be the greatest falsification of our time.
- Politics was Ahmed Patel's whole life.
- For many Indians, their future as global players is linked to the American dream.
