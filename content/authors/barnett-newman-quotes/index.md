- I hope that my painting has the impact of giving someone, as it did me, the feeling of his own totality, of his own separateness, of his own individuality.
- Any art worthy of its name should address 'life', 'man', 'nature', 'death' and 'tragedy'.
- I prefer to leave the paintings to speak for themselves.
