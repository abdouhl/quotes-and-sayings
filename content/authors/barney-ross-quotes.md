- I was standing on the deck of the USS Blue, a destroyer. We were all alone out there at this buoy, tied up.
- I was 20 years old at Pearl Harbor. I was in the Navy about a year and four months before the war.

- I had been out there long enough. I had not seen my family for four years.
- They got word that the Japanese planes were coming back, so we sunk her ourselves so the Japanese wouldn't get it. We didn't want the Japanese to get it intact.
