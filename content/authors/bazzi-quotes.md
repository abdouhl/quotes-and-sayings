- I've been playing guitar since I was 6 and then drums, bass, and piano since I was 10 years old.
- 'Mine' was interesting because it was about the way that someone made me feel so loved - so beautiful, so special, so accepted. I knew that it was deeper than just writing a song about that.

- I tried out for 'The Voice,' and I also tried out for 'America's Got Talent,' and both them, like, reached out to me. I had, like, little singing video on YouTube, and they were like, 'Come out for an audition.' I did, and I got a callback for both of them, actually, and, uh, didn't get anything after that. I was so heartbroken. But look at me now!
- Yeah, 'Mine' was inspired by a person, but it became much deeper than that. I obviously pulled lyrics... from stuff I was actually saying to this person and feeling about this person, but it was for people. I didn't want to make that song to impress that girl; I wanted to make that song to make people feel better.

- I think space and music go hand in hand in the sense that they give a little more mystery and magic to life.
