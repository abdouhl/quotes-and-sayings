- I keep my perfume in the fridge. If someone sees me in the morning pushing aside the eggs to grab my perfume, it might look a little odd, but it's so refreshing to spray cold fragrance on your skin.
- I'm blessed that I can leave it to the pros at work and red-carpet events, because I can't say I'm adept. Still, I'm definitely not afraid to take chances when it comes to beauty.
- I read fashion magazines all the time. It's fun, but I don't take it very seriously.
- I would say to an actor new to the business that it's best to go where you are most comfortable as a person, both in and outside of the business.
- Glamour is fun! Spending time to get ready isn't about being fussy; it's about taking care of myself.
- I've learned there's nothing wrong with being a little fussy. I used to pride myself on being low-maintenance - I wore it like a badge of honor.
- I started out a die-hard New Yorker but really grew to love working in Los Angeles. Even though I originally wanted to do theater, TV presented more opportunities for me, which led me out west.
- I've managed to get some beautiful bags. I have a great collection, and so does my mother. My favourite is a purple one by Gucci, which I take everywhere!
- I do tell people when I'm walking down the street that they should really rethink their whole outfit.
- I have a degree in European history, which didn't necessarily have any direct impact on my career, but I'm grateful I studied something other than acting in college.
- I'd have loved to have appeared in 'Absolutely Fabulous' - that's one of my favourite shows.
- After leaving school, I travelled around Europe for about six months. In Denmark, I thought that was my chance to get an amazing haircut, so I went to what I thought was a great hairdresser. It turned out to be the car wash of hairdressers, and I walked out sporting yet another pudding bowl, but this time with a stripe bleached down the centre.
- I really enjoy playing a sex symbol, but it's not something I feel in real life. I'm much more of a natural girl at home.
- I'm not cut out to be a detective on 'Law & Order' - I laugh too easily.
- My husband is in charge of all phone, email and texting duties at home. He even has to turn on the TV and air conditioning because I'm so hopeless with technology.
- When I read the 'Ugly Betty' pilot, I thought, 'Oh, this part's funny.' I said to my husband, 'I'm going to get it!' But based on what? All my exquisite comedic work in a Nike commercial?
- As an actress, one of the perks is having access to ridiculously expensive clothing and prancing around on the red carpet. Who wouldn't want to have fun with that?
- Growing up, I had a terrible pudding-bowl haircut. I used to cut it myself, and I'd sew my own clothing, too. I looked a little strange compared to the other kids. But the thing was, I felt I looked amazing, so what other people thought never bothered me.
- Normally, it's one or the other - a pretty, straight woman or a more charactery woman who isn't supposed to be attractive. But women like Tina Fey are leading the charge on being both. You can be funny and attractive.
- In N.Y.C., I auditioned for mostly 'quirky friend' roles. Since casting directors in L.A. lacked a preconceived notion of me, I was able to reinvent my type a bit, which was essential in booking the role of Amanda on 'Ugly Betty.' I don't believe I would have auditioned for that role in N.Y.
- I've learned through experience that you can't ever predict what's going to happen with any show. When I signed on to 'Ugly Betty,' I just prayed that I wouldn't get fired after the pilot, and four years later, I was still doing it.
- I'm not afraid to go completely over the top. A lot of people are scared to seem silly or to embarrass themselves, and I really don't have that at all - I don't mind making a fool of myself. I like to just have fun and really go for it.
- I'm always looking for that sense of fun and adventure and even unlikeability. I don't want to be the obvious leading lady. I have the most fun playing these girls who are a little damaged and maybe a little insecure and trying to overcompensate for it.
- When I think of the most beautiful women, they're not supermodels.
