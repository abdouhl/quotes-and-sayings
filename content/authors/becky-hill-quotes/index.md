- My debut album is like a collection of work over the past nine or ten years that I've been writing since I was 18-years-old, and when you've had that long writing music you get to select the music that has worked really well.
- I mean, whenever I go back to Bewdley it's like I'm the local celebrity and that's very, very strange.
- Always feeling secondary and just being a voice rather than known as the song writer and artist... it's been a challenge to even get music videos of most of the features I'm on, so I'm pleased people are starting to recognise me as an artist in my own right.
- I'd always wanted a challenge and I suppose that's why I've always wanted to go into pop music, because I want to be seen as someone that broke the record.
- So 'Heaven On My Mind' is a song I would never have thought about writing. But I really loved the concept knowing there is a light at the end of the tunnel.
- It's been frustrating that people only saw me as a 'featured artist' for a while, but in terms of making an album, it's been quite a nice, unpressurised environment to write songs and pick the best ones.
- The thing is, I love writing music. It is my absolute passion.
- I will always write for other people. I will always write for myself. I will always want to make money. I will always want to be prominent and prevalent in the charts... so yeah, world domination.
- I have a song on my album called 'Distance' which I wrote in the pandemic all about not being to see my partner and having a sense of physical - and social - distance.
- So I thought I'd find out for myself and educate my generation on how rave has changed over the last 30 years, and how the creation of music and discovery of music had changed too.
- From when I was 18 I had an eight-album plan and I think I would love to make eight albums.
- My love for dance music started when I was a child. Some of my earliest memories are hearing Trance music in the charts and later being heavily influenced by the eclectic tastes of my big brother, he quickly turned me into an avid Drum 'n' Bass head even though I was too young to rave.
- I fought doing dance music as a solo artist for a long time. I always thought there was a ceiling with it.
- Live music is so powerful. You can really feel things that you will remember forever. I remember going to my first gig and I want to create that atmosphere for people.
- Growing up with music as a kid - I used to feel like artists were writing songs about me falling in love.
- I was born with a cyst on my vocal cords.
- When I finally turned 18, I started to wonder if rave was now different to what it was and whether I'd missed out on the golden days of rave. So, I thought I'd talk to some of the legends in the game and get an education on how music was made, listened to and the rave scene from before I was even born.
- I think it's important to find out who all the writers were and make sure everyone gets a fair cut - but the music industry hasn't really got payment of people right at all, to be honest.
