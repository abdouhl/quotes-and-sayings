- I was always a tomboy growing up in Africa.
- I'm an advocate for if you take something, you have to give something back, and I think Raw Spirit shares that philosophy. I love that it gives back to the communities they partner with. It's just truly a pure of hearted company.
- I honestly can't pick a favorite person I like to work with - that would be like choosing a favorite child!
- My ultimate style pin up is a tough question because my own style is influenced by so many sources. From Bianca Jagger to Kate Moss to Julie Christie. I love how they are always themselves and it never looks too 'done.'
- For summer, I definitely love doing stuff outside. I love beach volleyball if you're close to something like that. It's really fun; you can do it with a lot of friends.
- I have so many bras. I have so many, and then they get lost, and I look for a simple nude one to wear, and I can't find one because there's, like, lace and crazy colors that I never wear.
- I love dark chocolate - I could eat it 'til I puke.
- For me, it's hard to wear a bra the whole entire day if it's got underwire.
- My closet is pretty organized, I'm proud to say. It's set up by type of clothes and then by color. And then, of course, there's the rotating from spring/summer to fall/winter.
- I think the T-Shirt bra is really special for Victoria's Secret because it's that kind of simple bra that you wear under the t-shirt, so it doesn't have any lace or anything like that. So it's very smooth; it's very comfortable; it doesn't have a lot of padding in it.
- I tend to only color my hair once a year because I just like lighter streaks, and then, when I go in the sun, my hair naturally just goes lighter anyway.
- I love Marilyn Monroe, Jimi Hendrix, and Kurt Cobain. I really do. It doesn't matter what style they had - whether it was pin-up or whatever - it just worked for them, and it looked effortless even though it was fabulous. I like anything that just looks effortless.
- I love the color black. I wear a lot of black.
- I love Instagram - I don't actually go on Twitter and tweet; I just connect it through my Instagram account. I think it's a good way of getting stuff out there and connecting with people.
- I have no expectations. Not in a bad way, but I've learned that you can't plan ahead. I live day by day and see what happens.
- Pilates makes you feel good because you're doing something that's good for your body, and you start seeing it. It elongates the muscles.
- It's overkill when you put too much fragrance on. It's the worst. Not sexy, and it makes me want to puke. I'm nauseous. Know what I mean? Your game's off.
- I typically don't wear nail polish, as I like a natural look.
- I travel so much for work that when I fly, I prefer to travel light and bring a carry-on bag that I don't need to check.
- I really like the Chloe Sevigny for Opening Ceremony collection - all of those kind of laser-cut leather dresses.
- I am a woman after all, so some days I feel good and sexy in a bikini, and other days, I'm like, 'Where are my caftans?!'
- My favourite way of getting ready for a red carpet event is to turn the hair and makeup time into a bit of a pre-party. I use the same artists all of the time, so we know each other so well - so it's a 'hanging with friends' session. Music, lots of laughing, and food - because you must eat before the event.
- I've been blessed to work with amazing designers who have generously given me beautiful bags. Lancaster was very sweet and let me pick out my favorite one when I shot the campaign.
- I tried a juice cleanse once, and by the third day, I wanted to kill everyone. I honestly don't even think it's healthy. It's not good for you to just drink juice. Like, if you detox for one or two days, fine, but a 10- or 14-day juice cleanse? You have headaches, and I was in the worst moods. I couldn't do it. Starving.
- Kickboxing tightens you up.
- I've always wanted a family since I was a little girl - a big family. I'm an only child, so I wanted, like, 10 kids... for sure.
- I'll paddle board, swim in the ocean, roll in the sand, soak up the sun, eat good food, be with friends and family and go fishing with my dad.
- I always have eaten really healthy, but I'm not a diet freak.
- I listen to a lot of Sublime. Dude, I'm obsessed with Sublime. You have no idea.
- I like to start the day with yoga. It's the best way of moving into the day.
- The beach is definitely where I feel most at home. It's my oxygen. I forget how much I need it sometimes when I'm away working.
- I think I've learned a lot just from being in the industry in general, and I never really thought about what to put in my hair to get a perfect beach wave until I started modeling. People will use certain products on me, and I learn that way.
- Like my makeup, I keep my hair simple. It's either down or in a ponytail.
- Guys are so not into high-waisted things. I love high-waisted jeans. We all think that high-waisted things are flattering and awesome and beautiful and we're rocking it, and guys are always like, 'Ugh, she's wearing those high-waisted pants.'
- I think every girl has a little bit of rebellion inside. It's always fun to not follow every trend and not be the perfect good girl. It's edgy to be a little rebellious.
- My guilty pleasure is sugar.
- First date, it's always fun to go somewhere or do something, like go see a band... not make it too formal.
- I can't deal with the gym too much if I don't have somebody telling me what to do.
- When you pump up your exercise, it makes you feel better and makes you look better, so you do a better job. It's mental, too.
- I eat healthy and stay active and drink plenty of water.
- If I'm in N.Y.C., I love walking around during the summer. It's hot, but I love it. I enjoy seeing everyone out. New York is such a fun place. The energy is so amazing here during the summer.
- The cut of the bikini is definitely important. You want to wear one that compliments your body type.
- When I have a shoot or a big job coming up, I try my best to work out four or five times a week.
- I grew up in a really small town, so it wasn't really a fashion-forward place, and it was very casual.
- Trying to always stay healthy and exercise is the best thing.
- I love Versace; I love Donatella's vision! It still has that '90s supermodel vibe.
- I usually treat myself to a monthly facial, but I also love masks.
- Honestly, I don't shop in L.A. very much - it's mostly in New York or when I'm away on trips.
- My mom used to call me a 'jean hoarder' growing up because I had so many pairs of jeans - and I still do.
- I try to do Pilates when I can all year around and I also like to swim a lot. I also have a trainer that kicks my butt when it's needed.
- I also love a good cheesy movie, and I'm kind of addicted to my computer.
- Chanel makes an incredible red lip, and Tarte makes the best nude colors! I also love Giorgio Armani lipsticks - the Rouge d'Armani.
