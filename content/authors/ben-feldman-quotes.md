- My father's Jewish, so my world is Jewish whenever I go home.
- Every Thanksgiving, for the most part in my life, I've come to Deerfield in Chicago.
- I've been pretty lucky; I like my jobs.
- I was a weird kid.
- I am a huge pessimist, and I think that's just the east-coast Jew in me.
- If you look at the history of advertising, most of them were Jews, so it was only a matter of time before 'Mad Men' explored that area of advertising.
- We are all the same. Some people wear vests and live in Missouri, and some people wear tuxes and live in Hollywood. But we all talk about what's going on in the news. We have relationships. We make mistakes.
- I live in Los Angeles, which is the youngest place - there's no history to Los Angeles. Everything's fake.
- I think anybody's who's ever traveled to Paris or any sort of older European city will get caught up in the romance of the history and the ghosts you're surrounded by every day.
- My first job ever was at Baskin-Robbins when I was 14, which is probably the closest I'll ever come to having a corporate job like the one I play on TV - although I do work for Universal, so I suppose that's corporate.
- Tinder's fascinating to me. I wish it was around when I was single and not on television because I can't imagine doing it when you're on TV.
- It's funny: I don't get to play characters where I wear what I want to wear. With 'Mad Men,' if Janie Bryant doesn't laugh at me, then that outfit doesn't make it to air.
- My aunt is a famous L.A. chef, Susan Feniger, and she's got Street and Border Grill. So a fun night out for me is to go to my aunt's restaurants.
- Here's the thing about Jews in Hollywood. Not to stereotype, but the Jews I know here are the funniest, most self-deprecating people I know. And it's rare to find a Jew that is actually offended by comedy about them.
- With 'Mad Men,' you feel like you're a member of Seal Team Six when you're shooting.
- I was obsessed with Jack Nicholson. Like, I watched 'Prizzi's Honor' when I was, like, 11.
- I despise - I hate - I'm terrified of karaoke, and I wish I wasn't because everybody I know who's awesome loves it.
- Usually, if I'm yelling at the TV, I'm in a bar. If I'm by myself, and it's not a game, I often find myself scolding reality stars that can't hear me through the television set.
- I do tons of feminine things.
- Often, American audiences are underestimated by producers and movie studios. They often think we're dumber than we are.
- I certainly don't know a lot of anti-Semitic people, but I've got plenty of friends that have a whole bunch of Jew jokes up their sleeve, and every time it's relevant, it will come up.
- I would say what Mad Men has taught me has been a super elevated evaluation of text in general, and understanding subtext, and understanding where a character comes from - what he means by this or by that.
- Anything that Aaron Sorkin writes, I could watch a million times. One of the few shows that I've watched in repeats was 'The West Wing.'
- I never went online when I was single, aside from flirting with people on MySpace when that was relevant.
- For the beginning of my career, I was always playing people younger than me.
- I assume that the worst will happen. So I'm never optimistic.
- I'm unconventionally romantic.
- Every single cast has a couple bad eggs, or that person that everyone is making fun of or doesn't like.
- When you audition for shows in Hollywood, you go in, you do your scene, maybe you get an adjustment. It's sort of easy, and a lot of times it just feels sort of rote and simple. Whereas when you go to New York and you audition for plays, you walk out sweaty and intimidated and nervous and doubting yourself as an actor.
- The institution of marriage has been something that - we have a very temperamental relationship, marriage and I. I've seen a lot of not great examples of it.
- Dynamic change is always my favorite thing. As soon as I feel like I'm doing all of the same stuff over and over again, I'm bored and sad.
- There was a time where I chose my jobs based on what jobs were available to me, so I would choose 100 percent of them.
- I like ensemble shows.
- I never got on the 'Stranger Things' train. Everybody else did, but for me, I'm the wrong audience because I don't like sci-fi/fantasy.
- 'Mindy' was fun. Other than 'Superstore,' it was the other time I played an elitist, obnoxious idiot.
