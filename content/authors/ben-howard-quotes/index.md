- In England, it's usually cold. So surfing is more of an adventure where you're floating around in a big, dark, stormy sea rather than the California notion of girls in bikinis on beaches. It's really going into the fray. I like it because it gives you the extra time and space you need to think.

- As a musician you're always your own worst critic and you're always digging into your songs and evaluating your own self-worth of things.
- Loud sounds are everywhere.
- I just write about myself all the time, which is a funny one, because I don't really like sharing much stuff with other people, apart from music.

- I don't think I've ever been particularly careerist about music.
- I'm not prolific, I go over stuff and it goes for me and sometimes against me. I'm annoyed that I don't do enough stuff off-the-cuff. It's a difficult thing to do something quickly and stand behind it.
- Coming from the U.K., you realize how quiet England is, and as soon as you get to America, it's really big and brash and loud out here, and South by Southwest was the epitome of that.

- I think the most frustrating thing is when people... sometimes people are a bit lazy and they don't listen to something, and they'll just say you sound like something else and it's quite clear that you don't, I think that's frustrating.
- John Martyn is my biggest hero. My mom got me into his music when I was a kid. I've looked up to him more than anyone as a songwriter. And Bert Jansch is one of the pillars of acoustic music, the holy grail.
- The music you play, it's never intended for other people, so it's quite amazing dealing with stuff now, because obviously any tracks I write, a lot of folks are going to hear. It definitely plays on my mind quite a lot.

- I need some time and space to make sure I'm on the right track with myself and playing music I want to play.
- There's force-feeding people synthesised music, then there's a skill in technically being able to play an instrument, even if that is some electronic pad.

- I don't know if I'm particularly shy.

- I think New York City is a lot more European than the rest of America; it's much easier for an English person to wrap their head around it.
- I meet a lot of people who are awkward around me now. I was always embarrassed about that; the more attention I got, the less I wanted it and the more it would manifest in a physical way and I would be hunched over about it. I'm just starting to realise now that it's not my problem, it's somebody else's problem.

- I never understood how one could write a whole book: It is so technically challenging, and it's incredible the way writers put entire worlds inside of them on such a large scale. I tend to have that same feeling when I listen to music - it daunts me and makes me feel quite unsettled listening to so much talent and ambition.

- I was never in music to make it to award shows.
- So many people have told me that it's quite different playing out in the States, and obviously, as a musician, touring in the States is kind of the Holy Grail.

- That's the biggest thing we're excited about: to be in America and have shows sell out is an incredible thing.
- We spent so much time on 'Every Kingdom,' it was a real heart record.
