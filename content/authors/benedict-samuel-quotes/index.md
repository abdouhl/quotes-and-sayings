- I know the Mad Hatter has a long history in the 'Batman' canon. He's quite a historically rich character, and he's come in a lot of shapes and forms and interpretations.
- I want to write more and direct more, but only so I can keep practising my craft and be involved in the projects that really interest me.
- The Mad Hatter has probably the most beautiful hat I've ever seen. It's gorgeous. The costumes that this guy wears are fabulous.
- On the street, people think I'm a guitar-carrying band member with a rock-n'-roll lifestyle, but the closest I have ever got to being one is probably lip-synching.
- I really admire Mark Ruffalo and Philip Seymour Hoffman, and Vincent Gallo, for example, who writes and directs and acts in his own films.
- I've picked up so much about the technical aspects of filmmaking and television.
- When you have quick scenes, it becomes difficult to ascertain where your character fits and where they're going. I always enjoy scenes that have a movement to them.
- Xavier has been the ultimate role model. No matter how far away we are geographically, working together is something we feed off of.
- What motivates me is not staying still. I want to be busy, and I think too many good actors are left by the wayside through no fault of their own, but because there aren't necessarily enough opportunities out there.
- Good films that get made are so few and far between. I want to write and direct more, but only so I can keep a fresh perspective.
- You don't know when things are going to happen, so I don't think you should be waiting around for them, so I'm interested in making stuff and being in that stuff - that's what my focus is.
- 'The Walking Dead' producers are really in touch, and appreciative, of their viewers.
- I don't really create things externally; I'm not that kind of actor.
- I actually built my own dining table back home in Australia. It's a secret hobby of mine that I weirdly find transfixing.
- There's a really great feeling among the Australians in Hollywood. There's so many of us, and we all support each other, and it's a really nice feeling, being able to sit back and see so many people doing so well.
- I'm not on any social media. I'm a bit analog when it comes to the Internet and technology.
- A helpful thing for me has always been - this is from a great acting teacher Declan Donnellan - is this beautiful way of expressing how and why people do things that other people may not do. It's a simple sentence that says, 'I understand you; you don't understand me.'
