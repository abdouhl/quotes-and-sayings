- Occasionally, when you do a take, and - what I kind of sort of like is asking for a PPB - Personal Play Back.
- In America, you're just an American. You're accepted. It doesn't matter that you're of whatever race. If anything, I'm British, and that's it. So let's just get on with it, really.

- I've been really pleasantly surprised by 'Guardians of the Galaxy.' I'd never really heard of that gang before, that comic series before. And I think when you go into those, watching those sort of films, you watch them with no expectation as well, so you're always kind of pleasantly surprised, I think.
- Khan let Polo be his eyes and ears. He was the first one to build a bridge between East and West.
