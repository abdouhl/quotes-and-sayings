- The two principles referred to are Authority and Liberty, and the names of the two schools of Socialistic thought which fully and unreservedly represent one or the other of them are, respectively, State Socialism and Anarchism.
- The right of such control is already admitted by the State Socialists, though they maintain that, as a matter of fact, the individual would be allowed a much larger liberty than he now enjoys.
- This brings us to Anarchism, which may be described as the doctrine that all the affairs of men should be managed by individuals or voluntary associations, and that the State should be abolished.

- The exercise of authority over the same area by two States is a contradiction.
- Capitalism is at least tolerable, which cannot be said of Socialism or Communism.
- I have also seen it stated that Capital punishment is murder in its worst form. I should like to know upon what principle of human society these assertions are based and justified.
- But which is the State's essential function, aggression or defence, few seem to know or care.

- Anarchists are simply unterrified Jeffersonian Democrats.
- And capital punishment, however ineffective it may be and through whatever ignorance it may be resorted to, is a strictly defensive act, - at least in theory.
- The claim of the State Socialists, however, that this right would not be exercised in matters pertaining to the individual in the more intimate and private relations of his life is not borne out by the history of governments.

- The moment that justice must be paid for by the victim of injustice it becomes itself injustice.
- Socialism, on the contrary, extends its function to the description of society as it should be, and the discovery of the means of making it what it should be.
