- I don't love tennis but I like it a lot and it's something that I need to do and I need to do as best as I can.
- I am always available for selection for Davis Cup. If TA select me, then great. If TA does not select me, then there's not too much I can do.
- It's a Grand Slam. Everyone is playing to win, playing for themselves at the best level. They've prepared their best.

- Golf, tennis, I think we respect one another and the crowd. If you see golf tournaments, as well, on the side, no one's yelling, no one's talking. There's a lot of quiet there before someone is hitting the swing or stroke. So is tennis. It's a very respectful sport.
