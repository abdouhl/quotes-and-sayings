- I'd like to do Glinda in a movie of 'Wicked.' That'd be my dream.
- Always make sure you have your rent. At the end of the month, if you have to eat Ramen for a week because you won't have your rent money, just do it but make sure your rent is all there so you're not stressing about that. As long as you have your rent at least you have somewhere to live.
- Self-care equals success. You're going to be more successful if you take care of yourself and you're healthy.
- Anything that's outdoorsy and fun, like hiking, biking, running, paddleboarding, swimming in the ocean... and then I'll mix in Pilates, yoga, spin, ballet.
- Animals are everything to me. I always say, 'Who rescued who?' with my horse Belle. She is my greatest teacher. She teaches me to be grounded, present, and in the moment, which I feel is key to happiness. My panic attacks become nonexistent when spending time with my animals, especially out in nature.

- I use those Bitmojis, the ones you can make look like yourself.

- Know who you are, because that's how you will be cast at first. Then you can be Meryl Streep further down the road.
- Some people love to run, and it's therapy for them, and some people can't stand it. And I just feel like there's so much in our society where you're judging yourself based on what you think you need to do.
- New York, to me, is the arts capital of the world. I just feel so inspired when I'm there. I would love to live there at some point in my life and do a play.
- I'd love to tackle a classic Shakespeare play or take on Nora Helmer in 'A Doll's House.' Musical theater, it's the classics like Rodgers and Hammerstein and Cole Porter's 'Kiss Me Kate.' I'm much more a Julie Andrews-type soprano than an Idina Menzel.

- I love 'Yoga With Adriene' videos on YouTube, cardio hip-hop, and kickboxing.

It's like going to the gym as an actor: every single night, you have to recreate the illusion of the first time, so you really have to listen and connect and stay in the moment for an hour and a half - with no breaks.
- I like diner coffee.
- Working with horses has taught me how to ground myself in my body when I feel panicky.
