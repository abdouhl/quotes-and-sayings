- I played tennis and softball, and we had horses, growing up.
- I was really active as a kid. I was outdoors constantly.
- I enjoy doing fun things outdoors with my son to stay in shape. We like camping together. After a weekend in the woods, I'm sorer than after a week at the gym!
- My background is in dance. No, I'm kidding. I was actually really uncoordinated as a child, when it came to dance, but I did play a lot of sports, and I do some break-dancing from time-to-time. No, I really don't.
- I moved from Minnesota to Las Vegas when I was 13, so I spent my high school years there and did some things I'm not proud of.
- I have this vintage Valentino clutch. Ughhh, it's so pretty! Also, I'm not a big fur person, but I'll do a vintage fur every now and then.
- Growing up in Minnesota, I had a lot of freedom to run around, and we had go-carts and four-wheelers and all that stuff. I like that adrenalin-rush stuff. I did a little bit of dance, but mostly sports.
- I love to try new restaurants and breakfast places I can take my son to.
- When I went to L.A., I started modeling, hoping to travel and learn from photographers. It led to auditions to do commercials.
- I love dressing up around the holidays! My friends also really like to get dressed up. It's an excuse to get fancy.
- It's so weird, not knowing what your life is going to be. I'm being optimistic. And when 'Leverage' comes to an end, I have lots of ideas for other things. You can't really sit and wait for things to come to you.
