- I love the romance of the '40s. It was the perfect time to live. Technology wasn't so advanced that it made life more difficult, but it was just enough that you can send a phone call or a telegram. And people still took pride in how they looked. The men got dressed up and the women got dressed up and they took care of themselves.
- I am not a people person. It's not that I am shy, but I am more comfortable in an atmosphere of one-on-one. I hate crowds and parties.
- I guess I've sort of always wanted to be an actress, except when I was five, which, I did want to be the Queen of England.
- I was probably singing before I could talk. Musical theater is my passion. If I could afford it, I would just do dinner theater and live a simple life.
- A close girlfriend of mine and I have been writing and playing together for years and decided to make it official, so we formed a band called 'Everly.'
- I still don't know what I'm going to be. I love acting. I would love to be an English teacher. I would love to be a housewife and have a chateau in the South of France, I would love to be a singer that travels to cafes around different towns.
- I don't party. I'm a total homebody. I like hanging out with my cat, and I've actually been known to stay home and knit.
- There's so many things I'm dying to do. I wanna do a movie with horses.
- I want to move people; it's not about me. I have been given the gift of being an entertainer. I love getting to touch people's lives.
