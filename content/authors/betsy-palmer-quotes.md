- I love people. I was born loving people.
- When people visit me at autograph conventions and signings, they always say, 'You just don't know how you scared me!' These people are grown up. They say, 'When I was a kid, I just couldn't sleep at night.' Sometimes they will have babies with them. And they give me their babies, and they take pictures of me holding their baby.
- But I don't only get recognized for 'Friday the 13th.' I was on a TV show called' I've Got a Secret.' I was on that show for ten or eleven years. The older people always remember me from that.
- It's bad enough that I'm an actress that wants to be recognized as an actress. Instead, I am known for doing game shows.
