- Aging is not lost youth but a new stage of opportunity and strength.
- It is better for a woman to compete impersonally in society, as men do, than to compete for dominance in her own home with her husband, compete with her neighbors for empty status, and so smother her son that he cannot compete at all.
- Men are not the enemy, but the fellow victims. The real enemy is women's denigration of themselves.
- Man is not the enemy here, but the fellow victim.
- A woman is handicapped by her sex, and handicaps society, either by slavishly copying the pattern of man's advance in the professions, or by refusing to compete with man at all.
- We need to see men and women as equal partners, but it's hard to think of movies that do that. When I talk to people, they think of movies of forty-five years ago! Hepburn and Tracy!
