- If and when I do get recognized, it's because of 'Get Out.'
- I think that as kids we all picture ourselves as the princess, the prince, and not really ever as the housekeeper or the comical alpaca or llama or what have you - the sidekick. But as an adult, I'm such a huge fan of people who are funny and people who are, in very brief moments, able to do something that you would never think is possible.
- Genre is great and I love sci-fi.
- My dad was an army cook, so I sort of come from that. But, working on 'Westworld,' a lot of the guys who I'm rolling up in there with, they're actually ex-military people.
- It's always good to be able to identify with the characters that you're watching and not just easily put them in the bad box or the good box. They're real people that you care about, and you invest in their journey.
- I'd love to see a woman host the Oscars.
- I think there is a lot of technology that is finding its way into our storytelling - it's pretty unavoidable.
- I truly hope that we can evolve with technology, and use it for the benefit of all mankind, but history might suggest otherwise.
- Predominantly I've worked with Blumhouse, and they've been really great to me. We are extremely grateful for employment. But maybe my dark soul attracts these darker, horrifying stories. But I don't particularly close myself off to any employment - any stories, I should say.
- I met Angela Bassett during the awards circuit. I was actually surprised at how moved I was to meet her in person. I was moved to tears. I find that feeling, it's happened occasionally, and I never know who it'll be with.
- Your home is your sanctuary. You need to make it a place you love to be in.
- We are a very polarised country.
- As an actor, it was great to work with Harry Lloyd because he's wicked smart, and he is very kind.
- I guess I have an affinity towards darkness, the dark side.
- I find the horror genre quite challenging. That's not to say everything I've done has been straight horror - a lot of them have been more on the thriller side. But regardless, I find it the most challenging as an actor to create sheer anxiety and terror out of nowhere because there's nothing scary going on and you have to act like it is.
- There's just always going to be both positives and negatives to any evolution that we're a part of. And there's really no stopping the evolution of technology. There has been more and more integration in our daily lives, so we become more and more dependent on it.
- I think people let their guards down when they think that they're not being intimidated or they're not being threatened.
- Theater actually took time to pique my interest. It just wasn't a part of my upbringing. I don't have anyone in the arts in my family. I wasn't brought up particularly cultured. It was always TV and film for me.
- I would love to play, perhaps not exactly Mimi in 'Rent,' but someone like her. Perhaps not on Broadway, but I think I feel like a musical is in my future. I sing, although I'm not Whitney Houston up in here. I'm a little bit shy about my singing, but I did it in school at Juilliard.
- I feel like Blumhouse has really taking a liking to me and it's awesome.
- I want to work with the greats.
- I'm humble, because I live quite humbly.
- I believe in the power that a casting director has.
- My personal closet has mostly vintage and thrift store finds because I like to recycle in many ways.
- I like to be very physical: Any sort of fight sequence is a dream to me.
- I want to have fun and be a diva - a kind-hearted diva!
- I don't love horror, I respect it as a genre.
- Television, nowadays, is like doing really long films.
- I would love to do a musical. Put that in the universe! A rom-com musical!
- I do like musicals, but I'm not so well-versed in them. I would rather tell stories that just so happen to have a song in them, like someone has a cabaret number.
- Honestly, I had a very realistic, probably pessimistic outlook at the beginning of my career post-graduation of drama school. In general, I would see black women, usually older, playing a certain archetype on procedural shows. I thought, 'Okay, that's what I have to look forward to.'
- Yes, people can crack under pressure, but I think people can also let things slip out when they're comfortable.
- I'm not making millions here, and because I'm a Capricorn I save up. You have to save for winter.
- I definitely get my sleep.
- Westworld' was its own treat and its own enigma. It was a great experience, but I definitely was not privy to a lot of things on that show.
- I remember seeing 'The Babadook' and I thought that was such a wonderfully dramatic story but told with these horrifying elements, and that's incredible. It did give me nightmares but I was glad that I watched it.
- Often times I don't watch the Oscars because I say this isn't for me.
