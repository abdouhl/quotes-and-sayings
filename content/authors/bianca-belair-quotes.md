- If you know me from my NXT days, you know that I always walk around saying that I'm the strongest and I'm the toughest; that's in me.
- Sometimes I'm out in public and people are like 'you're a wrestler?' and they kind of ask me with a little question in their voice, like 'oh I didn't know that WWE had wrestlers like you. I'm going to start watching.'
- Well, when it comes to life, I'm all about the journey.
- Sasha Banks is amazing.
- I'm always talking about how representation is such an important thing - it's not just a request, it's a requirement - it needs to happen.
