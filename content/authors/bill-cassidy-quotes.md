- I think different presidents have different ways of governing. We just have to respect that.
- My wife has a public charter school for children with dyslexia. Almost every one of them has failed in a public school.
- When I turn 55, I'm going to be on Medicare. I can call up and tell them I don't want to be on Medicare, but otherwise, I'll be on Medicare. So they use this kind of automatic enrollment. We give states the option of automatically enrolling those who are eligible.
- Every insurer must offer every individual a plan and ensure each patient with pre-existing conditions has access to 'adequate and affordable health insurance coverage.'
- One of the clear problems of Obamacare is that it was perceived, I think rightly, as one party forcing its vision of how healthcare should be upon the rest of the country.
- Under Graham-Cassidy-Heller-Johnson, more people will have coverage, and we protect those with pre-existing conditions.
- Politics is about the art of the possible.
- We can bring health care back to the states and bring power back to patients. I think of that commercial from 1984 when Apple took a hammer and broke the screen.
- Children typically are not screened for dyslexia, which means it's not until fourth grade that it's detected, at which point they have to take a standardized test, and they can't read. I mean, they literally cannot read.
- You can lower premiums in a variety of ways, but one way to lower premiums is to just give people lousy coverage.
- If someone has money, they can put their child in a private school, paying tens of thousands of dollars for tuition. But their child's needs are met. What is lacking is options for that single mom with three kids, or just that intact family but lower income.
- President Trump has said he will not sign a bill which does not protect those with pre-existing conditions. I'm a physician who worked in a public hospital for 25 years caring for those with pre-existing conditions.
- You become a senator not by being passive but by being active, and all of a sudden, we've got a whole group just deciding to sit on their palms.
- The CHIP program, even if the parliamentarian says nothing else is allowed - and that is a possibility - CHIP, which no state ever complains about, gives a lot more flexibility than Obamacare and allows the secretary of HHS to give waivers.
- FDR, as best as I can tell, had no kind of involvement at all in our conversion to the paper currency.
- As far as I'm concerned, the more power we push back to the patient, the individual, the American citizen, the more responsive the system is to her needs. 'Obamacare,is responsive' is like a hammer is responsive to a piece of glass.
