- Considering their impact, you might expect mosquitoes to get more attention than they do. Sharks kill fewer than a dozen people every year, and in the U.S. they get a week dedicated to them on TV every year.

- According to Ethiopian custom, parents wait to name a baby because children often die in the first weeks of life.
- Should there be cameras everywhere in outdoor streets? My personal view is having cameras in inner cities is a very good thing. In the case of London, petty crime has gone down. They catch terrorists because of it. And if something really bad happens, most of the time you can figure out who did it.
- Music, even with these dial-up connections you have to the Internet, is very practical to download.
- Software substitution, whether it's for drivers or waiters or nurses - it's progressing. Technology over time will reduce demand for jobs, particularly at the lower end of skill set.
- In ninth grade, I came up with a new form of rebellion. I hadn't been getting good grades, but I decided to get all A's without taking a book home. I didn't go to math class, because I knew enough and had read ahead, and I placed within the top 10 people in the nation on an aptitude exam.
- When the PC was launched, people knew it was important.
- The spread of online information isn't just good for charities. It's also good for donors. You can go to a site like Charity Navigator, which evaluates nonprofits on their financial health as well as the amount of information they share about their work.
- You have to have a certain realism that government is a pretty blunt instrument, and without the constant attention of highly qualified people with the right metrics, it will fall into not doing things very well.

- In inner-city, low-income communities of color, there's such a high correlation in terms of educational quality and success.
- I don't have a magic formula for prioritizing the world's problems.

- We've got to put a lot of money into changing behavior.
- Internet TV and the move to the digital approach is quite revolutionary. TV has historically has been a broadcast medium with everybody picking from a very finite number of channels.
- We are in the throes of a transition where every publication has to think of their digital strategy.
- The future of Windows is to let the computer see, listen and even learn.
- Information technology and business are becoming inextricably interwoven. I don't think anybody can talk meaningfully about one without the talking about the other.
- It's fine to celebrate success but it is more important to heed the lessons of failure.
- If you're using first-class land for biofuels, then you're competing with the growing of food. And so you're actually spiking food prices by moving energy production into agriculture.
- The misconception that aid falls straight into the hands of dictators largely stems from the Cold War era.
- Intellectual property has the shelf life of a banana.

- We make the future sustainable when we invest in the poor, not when we insist on their suffering.
- Philanthropy should be voluntary.
- The fight against AIDS in China is already well underway. The Chinese government and other funders are providing major support, and they'll continue to bear primary responsibility for delivering prevention and treatment.
- Haiti should remind us all that there is an immediate need to invest in and promote long-term development projects that are sustainable, scalable, and proven to work.
- The Center for Disease Control started out as the malaria war control board based in Atlanta. Partly because the head of Coke had some people out to his plantation, and they got infected with malaria, and partly 'cause all the military recruits were coming down and having a higher fatality rate from malaria while training than in the field.
- I've been very lucky, and therefore I owe it to try and reduce the inequity in the world. And that's kind of a religious belief. I mean, it's at least a moral belief.

- Helping convene global stakeholders to establish a set of measurable, actionable and consensus-built goals focused on extreme poverty is invaluable.
- We have to find a way to make the aspects of capitalism that serve wealthier people serve poorer people as well.
- You're never going to get the amount of CO2 emitted to go down unless you deal with the one magic metric, which is CO2 per kilowatt-hour.
- In K-12, almost everybody goes to local schools. Universities are a bit different because kids actually do pick the university. The bizarre thing, though, is that the merit of university is actually how good the students going in are: the SAT scores of the kids going in.
- I'm a great believer that any tool that enhances communication has profound effects in terms of how people can learn from each other, and how they can achieve the kind of freedoms that they're interested in.
- Americans move more than 10 times over the course of a lifetime.
- China has many successful entrepreneurs and business people. I hope that more people of insight will put their talents to work to improve the lives of poor people in China and around the world, and seek solutions for them.

- The microprocessor is a miracle.
- Corruption is one of the most common reasons I hear in views that criticize aid.
- Windows is probably the most important product in the entire PC industry. Everything we do in terms of supporting touch, new hardware, accessibility has incredible impact.
- To create a new standard, it takes something that's not just a little bit different; it takes something that's really new and really captures people's imagination, and the Macintosh, of all the machines I've ever seen, is the only one that meets that standard.
- We all know that there are these exemplars who can take the toughest students, and they'll teach them two-and-a-half years of math in a single year.
- In terms of mathematics textbooks, why can't you have the scale of a national market? Right now, we have a Texas textbook that's different from a California textbook that's different from a Massachusetts textbook. That's very expensive.
- For a highly motivated learner, it's not like knowledge is secret and somehow the Internet made it not secret. It just made knowledge easy to find. If you're a motivated enough learner, books are pretty good.
- No one person controls Microsoft. The board and the shareholders decide whether they want to have me as CEO.
- It's the poorer people in tropical zones who will get really hit by climate change - as well as some ecosystems, which nobody wants to see disappear.
- We always overestimate the change that will occur in the next two years and underestimate the change that will occur in the next ten. Don't let yourself be lulled into inaction.

- Exposure from a young age to the realities of the world is a super-big thing.

- Maintaining a consistent platform also helps improve product support - a significant problem in the software industry.
- I think the thing we see is that as people are using video games more, they tend to watch passive TV a bit less. And so using the PC for the Internet, playing video games, is starting to cut into the rather unbelievable amount of time people spend watching TV.
- Antitrust is the way that the government promotes markets when there are market failures. It has nothing to do with the idea of free information.
- Of my mental cycles, I devote maybe ten percent to business thinking. Business isn't that complicated. I wouldn't want to put it on my business card.
- Certainly, the Windows share of servers is strong.

- Common Core is a big win for education.
- DOS is ugly and interferes with users' experience.
- The Internet is the easiest thing to get into. To be an Internet retailer, you just get that URL.

- Contrary to popular belief, I don't spend a whole lot of time following soccer. But as I have traveled around the world to better understand global development and health, I've learned that soccer is truly universal. No matter where I go, that's what kids are playing. That's what people are talking about.

- Whether I'm at the office, at home, or on the road, I always have a stack of books I'm looking forward to reading.
- Should surveillance be usable for petty crimes like jaywalking or minor drug possession? Or is there a higher threshold for certain information? Those aren't easy questions.
- The only thing I understand deeply, because in my teens I was thinking about it, and every year of my life, is software. So I'll never be hands-on on anything except software.
- Two out of every five people on Earth today owe their lives to the higher crop outputs that fertilizer has made possible.
- I don't generally read a lot of fiction.
- I've always been amazed by Da Vinci, because he worked out science on his own. He would work by drawing things and writing down his ideas. Of course, he designed all sorts of flying machines way before you could actually build something like that.
- The moral systems of religion, I think, are super important.
- The common thread for everything I do is this idea of a Web-services architecture. What does that mean?

- Teaching's hard! You need different skills: positive reinforcement, keeping students from getting bored, commanding their attention in a certain way.

- It's possible - you can never know - that the universe exists only for me. If so, it's sure going well for me, I must admit.

- Who decides what's in Windows? The customers who buy it.
- Treatment without prevention is simply unsustainable.

- By improving health, empowering women, population growth comes down.
- I've always been interested in science - one of my favourite books is James Watson's 'Molecular Biology of the Gene.'
