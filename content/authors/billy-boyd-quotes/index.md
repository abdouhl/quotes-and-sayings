- Hobbits are a lot like Scots. It's all about nature and enjoying their land, which is a very Scottish thing.
- The club thing is a world people can associate with, letting your hair down at the weekend.
- I think Scotland has some great stories.
- I think I have a gift, but I haven't really opened that gift yet and given it to myself.
- After I've been in America for a while, I get homesick for Scotland.
- I really like acting but, just now, the more I read a script I find myself thinking I'd like to direct rather than act.
- My worst habit is whistling while I sleep.
- In fact, Russell Crowe once phoned me up to see if I wanted to go to a party but I had to bring my guitar and perform 'Oh Jean.'
- Then there are actors my age like Ethan Hawke, he's in 'Moby Dick,' I love his work. I've been lucky. Alfred Molina, he has real class.
- I loved going surfing down on Venice Beach. I'd go out with a board under my arm and think, 'I can't do that in Cranhill.'
- But you talk to most filmmakers and it is six, seven, eight years trying to get things off the ground. It is incredible really.
- I'd be lying if I said it wasn't fun to go to these nights out, like the opening of a film or something, but I dip in and out of it.
- Life in LA is not lying in the sun for months. It is having a 4pm meeting and leaving at noon to sit in traffic for four hours. It's not glam.
- People are scared to make something that doesn't look like another film that made a lot of money. It means we get 'Four Weddings And A Funeral' made again and again.
- Rather than thinking, 'If I do this, and in five years I'll be where I want to be,' you're better just doing something that makes you happy now.
- I think once you get it in your head, that you're not going to do anything bigger, you just do things that you enjoy, which has always been my ethos anyway.
