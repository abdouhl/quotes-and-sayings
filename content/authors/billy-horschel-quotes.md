- I'm never going to be a flat-line guy. My heart is going to be on my sleeve with every shot.
- I'm a big kid. I love drinking chocolate milk. I'm not afraid to watch some cartoons once in a while when I'm with my nieces and actually be attentive.
- When somebody doesn't use common sense, I get frustrated. When I'm driving down the highway and someone is in the left-hand lane, and they're going very slow, sometimes I just go around them, and other times I'll be in the mood where I flash my lights and yell at them, like, 'What the heck are you doing? Get the heck out of my way!'
- I'm not a guy who needs to drink coffee or anything to get myself going in the morning. I wake up, and I'm full of energy.
- I just feel like a kid that has some money now, that can take care of my family... I think I'll always be a kid. I'm always messing around, always running around, always trying to have a good time.
- I always wanted to be a professional athlete. I love my life.
- I don't discriminate against sushi. It's all good in my book.
