- I think that the climate within the band has changed, it's now in a more functional situation.
- When you're a songwriter and you click with someone, you tend to want to keep writing with that person.
- I know that if I went to other studios, like in Vancouver, that those are set up to be as professional and as true, so it's just a different flavour, it's a different sound, but I think both have their place.
- We came off the road of the last tour very inspired to just keep playing, so we went to Canada.
- So in one sense you don't have the classic keyboard player in Yes.
- It's an album that is a little bit different and probably isn't easy to get out. It's not likely that a major label would have picked it up and said that they had a smash hit record.
- I have always enjoyed different kinds of music.
- So one can say that I write all the time, that goes for the lyrics as well.
- Sometimes I hear a drum groove in my head and I rush down to my studio.
- I love all Yes music and love to play it live, but I'm most interested in making new music with Yes.
- Everyone is really getting along with each other and we enjoy each others company and love playing live.
- And I found that when I built my own place and just shut the door, the creativity was endless.
- So whenever I had some in-between producing time down in my studio I popped a tape in and started working on it. Working a little bit at a time, it actually took almost four years.
- So when bands work with me and it's 10 o'clock, usually you'd have to be getting out of the studio, we could go on until 2 in the morning cause it's my place!
- I write on all instruments.
- I'd written songs with lots of people, from one spectrum to the other.
- I don't have any assistants, I do it all myself, I don't have any secretaries.
- I grew up in a very musical family, my father was a musician and a big band leader and made records.
- So that studio served its purpose, and still is working very well for other people right now.
- I mean, Beatles songs were two and a half minutes long, and they're fantastic.
- I also write poems, so that is something that I really enjoy.
- And as you said, everyone contributed; certain areas of material came from certain individuals.
- So I was always around music and my dad was in his own way a progressive jazzer, a big band jazzer guy.
- I've had the luxury of owning my own studio, 24 analogue, 48 digital, endless effects, endless hardcore gear, that I don't have to rent, I don't get stuck with the bills, it's all mine.
- I'm very proud of it as a Yes record amongst many of the other Yes records.
- I wrote songs with the guys from Air Supply for their record... So I was just writing songs.
- You know, I am just a musician and I have no idea these days what good and bad is in terms of labels.
- I wasn't really writing with anything commercial in mind I just wanted to create some new music.
- So for my studio purposes, I know that I'm in my studio with technicians who've done amazing things to my board and to my power amps and I know what I can deliver out of my studio.
- I love the feeling of creating pictures in someone's mind just by spelling out the right lyrical combination.
