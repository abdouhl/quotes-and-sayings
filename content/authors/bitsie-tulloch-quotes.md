- I definitely have some stereotypical qualities of being a Latina. I talk with my hands, which means I knock stuff over all the time.
- When I was little, I wanted to be a civil engineer. Not a ballerina, not a doctor, a civil engineer. I was such a nerd.
- My family came over from Spain about nine generations ago. I was born in San Diego, but by the time I was four days old, I was on a flight back to Spain because that's where my family was living at the time.
- I think Latin American cultures are really rich and fascinating. I like the pomp and circumstance of some of their rituals and ceremonies.
- I love Spain. It's my favorite country that I've been to and I've traveled quite a bit. I've been really fortunate as an adult to have been to a lot of interesting places like Egypt and China.
- I speak Spanish because I grew up overseas in Spain, Uruguay and Argentina.
- I am never happier than when I am on set and getting to act. And I can't wait for what is yet to come.
- Portland is a really great city, especially because I'm a shopper and there's no sales tax! That really adds up so fast, because in California, a $1000 pair of shoes ends up costing another $100.
- I don't watch scary movies. Sometimes, even having to read the script and do an episode of 'Grimm,' I get a little tense because I know someone's going to jump out of somewhere.
- I got kicked out in grade school because I staged a riot because I wanted more library time.
- I never wanted to be an actress, really. I sort of caught the bug fairly late. So many people are so intrigued with the glamour and celebrity of acting, and a lot of actors start acting when they are 9 or 10 years old - so young. I started when I was about 24.
- When I was a little girl, I wanted to be a civil engineer. No joke. I would come home from school and build bridges out of toothpicks and see how much weight they would hold before falling.
- My not-so-fun traits are that I get very impatient and I can be really stubborn.
