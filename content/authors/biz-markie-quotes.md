- I love kids. Every time I go around people neighborhood, they're like, 'Biz! Yo Gabba Gabba!' They want me to beatbox all the time for them.
- I'm into the old school. I listen to rock, soft rock, jazz, old school R&B.
- I don't care about anything but what I want to do. You can't worry about what else is happening out there. You have to be true to yourself.
- I can be serious, but there's got to be a lighter side.
- I really want to be the black Mr. Rogers - that's my goal. I would do everything the same but with a hip-hop feel to it.
- I'd eat, eat, eat, not exercise, go to sleep, eat and eat. I looked up in the mirror and said I had to make a change if I was going to continue to live.
- I used to eat, like, a whole Entenmann's cake at one time with a half-gallon of milk.
- There's not enough people being daring and different. There are a lot of followers in hip-hop.
- There's certain cakes you've got to have, maybe a pie here and there. But I know to not do it as much.
- I would never be a sellout, but you can never be a sellout to kids. Kids is kids!
- It only takes me about four days to write an album. It don't take that long. I just gotta have the feeling. If I don't have the feeling, it's a different story. I gotta be in the mood.
- We always honor our people when they die; we've got to honor them while we're still alive.
- I love 'Yo Gabba Gabba!' because it's a real kids' show. There hasn't been a real kids' show since 'Dora the Explorer.' It mixes hip-hop with being a kid. Hip-hop came from youths anyway. It's just a great, funky show.
- I just wanted to be different; I didn't wanna sound like anybody else.
- My thing is whatever comes at me, I'm there. But DJ-ing and music is my passion... I'm going to be unpredictable.
- Usually on 'Yo Gabba Gabba,' we eat healthy and organic. We don't play.
- When I used to be on stage, I used to be out of breath; I couldn't walk that far. Now, I got so much energy. I can do a whole show.
- Usually when I make a record, I know what the potential is going to be, but I didn't know that 'Just A Friend' was going to be that big. 'Just A Friend' opened a world up where I never knew the difference between being a pop star and a regular rap star. It was crazy.
- I walk. I do the treadmill; I walk around the mall. I do a little crunches with my stomach, not that much. Just enough to get the engine going cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha! Vroooommmmm.
- I'm an avid collector of toys. I got everything. Name it. From the Easy Bake Oven to Barbies to every TV show doll, racing cars... I've been collecting since I was a little kid.
- I could see myself doing a cooking show.
- There are still recording artists out there doing things for the right reason, but a lot of people seem to be just driven by fame.
- I can sell anything. I'm very convincing.
