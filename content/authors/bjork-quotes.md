- I've always appreciated working with people I have chemistry with, who are friends, and where you feel that the work is growing while you are getting to know each other better.
- I would like to teach music. It's weird the way they teach music in schools like Julliard these days.
- Feminists bore me to death. I follow my instinct and if that supports young girls in any way, great. But I'd rather they saw it more as a lesson about following their own instincts rather than imitating somebody.
- In 2008, I was more just thinking about using the touchscreen for writing the songs. From there I started thinking about how I visualised music.
- I don't expect people to get me. That would be quite arrogant. I think there are a lot of people out there in the world that nobody gets.
- What probably confuses people is they know a lot about me, but it quite pleases me that there's more they don't know.
- The English can be a very critical, unforgiving people, but criticism can be good. And this is a country that loves comedy.
- The English eat all sorts of birds - pigeons, ducks, sparrows - but if you tell them you eat puffin, you might as well come from Mars.
- Usually when you see females in movies, they feel like they have these metallic structures around them, they are caged in by male energy.
- In order to actually have a touchscreen in front of me and somehow still be connected to nature, I needed to be able to incorporate natural elements into the song structures. Because that's always been my song-writing accompaniment: nature.

- With a small town mentality, you make a decision very early on as to whether you are going to do everything by the book or just go your own way and not care.
- Sometimes when I write lyrics there are images in them, usually on a quite simplistic level, like colors. But most often music comes first and then later I sit down with visual people and we chat about what we want to do. I don't look at myself as a visual artist. I make music.
- I get obsessed by little nerdy things in my corner that no one else is interested in.
- Singing is like a celebration of oxygen.
- It's incredible how nature sets females up to take care of people, and yet it is tricky for them to take care of themselves.

- I've been traveling in Guatemala in the rainforest, and here all these houses are made of sticks. It seems so easy to make one.

- I'm just like anybody. I have my ups and downs.

- When I was a punk teenager, I rebelled because lots of people in Iceland think that foreigners are evil and that if you don't wear woolen hats and eat sheep, you're betraying your heritage.
- I'm a bit of a nerd, I wouldn't mind working in a shop selling records, or having a radio show where I could play obscure singles.
- Compared to America or Europe, God isn't a big part of our lives here. I don't know anyone here who goes to church when he's had a rough divorce or is going through depression. We go out into nature instead.
- We didn't really have television when I was a kid. Around 30, I discovered films and started systematically catching up. I collect interesting documentaries and films, and watch a few nights a week.
- My first album didn't come out until I was 27, which in pop years is late, you know. But when it came time to arrange it, I became a kid in a toy shop. I had a harp and a saxophone quartet and a symphony orchestra. I went berserk for a time.
- I find most children quite inspiring.
- As a singer-songwriter, what I do is write about how the human feels.
- I have written most of my melodies walking and I feel it is definitely one of the most helpful ways of sewing all of the different things in your life together and seeing the whole picture.
- Maybe it's just a personal thing, but I get so much grounding from Iceland because I know it's always going to be there. I have a very happy, healthy relationship with the country, so it's really easy to go everywhere because I always have Iceland to go back to.
- It's funny how the hippies and the punks tried to get rid of the conservatives, but they always seem to get the upper hand in the end.
- Most Icelandic people are really proud to be from there, and we don't have embarrassments like World War II where we were cruel to other people. We don't even have an army. So it's sort of like an all-around good, innocent place.
- I think religion is a mistake - I'm exhausted by its self-righteousness. I think atheists should start screaming for attention like religious folks do.
- Since I was a kid, I always wanted to figure out how to make a bass line that was a pendulum - like, gravity would control it, and then you could make it play different notes.
- I do love one-upmanship sometimes, like when you see kids breakdancing and who can do the best tricks. It's common, it's in our nature as animals, like the birds of paradise who've got the best feathers and that sort of stuff. But it's fun when it's impulsive and it's about fun.
- I sometimes fall into the trap of doing what I think I should be doing rather than what I want to be doing.
- The reason I do interviews is because I'm protecting my songs.
- I love England. It's no coincidence it's the first place I moved to for a more cosmopolitan life, which is the only thing Iceland lacks.

- I think every year brings unknowns that you have to deal with and handle, confront and embrace.
- I'm not going to talk like I know about politics, because I'm a total amateur, but maybe I can be a spokesperson for people who aren't normally interested in politics.

- When I met Apple, I made it very clear that I am an old punk and I have never done commercials or been sponsored. And I wasn't after their money.

- If nothing else, I have money.
- It would be flattering to be thought of as someone who celebrated life.
- The reason I do photographs is to help people understand my music, so it's very important that I am the same, emotionally, in the photographs as in the music. Most people's eyes are much better developed than their ears. If they see a certain emotion in the photograph, then they'll understand the music.
- Nature has always been important to me. It has always been in my music.
- I feel like the people from Iceland have a different relationship with their country than other places. Most Icelandic people are really proud to be from there, and we don't have embarrassments like World War II where we were cruel to other people.
- In '96, I was in a very specific place with my own music - I was only listening to beats. You would come to my house, and I would just play beats all day.
- I'd done three solo albums in a row, and that's quite narcissistic.
- People are always asking me about eskimos, but there are no eskimos in Iceland.

- Sometimes, when I have a lot of ideas and I want to do a lot of things, or when I'm traveling, I lose energy and I can't do as many things as I want. So I have to plan days when I'm not doing anything. I find that a bit boring, but it's necessary.
- Maybe I'll be a feminist in my old age.
- Living in a capital in Europe but still surrounded by mountains and ocean, my relationship to music was strongest walking to school and back. I would sing to myself and very quickly started mapping out my melodies to landscapes - at the time I just thought it was very matter of fact, a common thing to do.
- For a person as obsessed with music as I am, I always hear a song in the back of my head, all the time, and that usually is my own tune. I've done that all my life.
- I get embarrassed listening to my last CDs. I've got a lot of work to do, let's put it that way.
- Nature hasn't gone anywhere. It is all around us, all the planets, galaxies and so on. We are nothing in comparison.
- There's something about the rhythm of walking, how, after about an hour and a half, the mind and body can't help getting in sync.
- There's no map to human behaviour.
- I bought a laptop in 1999, and it was quite liberating, because I could make a lot of my own decisions.
- But I'm not interested in politics. I lose interest the microsecond it ceases to be emotional, when something becomes a political movement. What I'm interested in is emotions.
- The good thing about Pro Tools is you can actually hear what you're working on, so it doesn't just become this intellectual idea. But Pro Tools can be dangerous, too. It can make things sterile.

- Most people in Iceland are blonde and blue-eyed. I was nicknamed 'China girl' in school 'cos they thought I looked Asian.
- I am one of the most idiosyncratic people around.
