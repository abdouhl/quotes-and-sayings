- God's supreme word to us is life; our highest worship of Him is love for the living.
- I have friends among the Christians, whom I love, and never for a moment have I thought of attacking their Christianity.
- Nothing has ever moulded our conscience so strongly as our knowledge of what is good and what is evil.
