- See, I'm a Pisces, so I get down with love songs. I'm totally into slow jams and old-school R&B, all that.
- A lot of my music that I like puts energy in your body or makes you want to dance or break something or just go mosh or jump around.
- I think sketch writing is a good spot for everyone to start because it requires you to develop characters, have a beginning, middle and end and have a bunch of jokes in a short amount of time.
- The lead singer for Deerhunter, Bradford Cox... I don't like saying people are geniuses or whatever, but I just think that dude is so good at every single thing he does. He stays within his genre, but I think he does so well experimenting with stuff.
- I think that it should just be a rule of thumb that if your job asks you to cut your hair... that means that it's time to quit that job.
- I love mayonnaise. Every birthday when I was a kid I'd go to Black Angus and just dip my burger in mayo.
- I pretty much figure a collar will do, but as time goes on, I'm hoping I learn how to throw a suit on or something. I've still got some time. I'm not the president of the United States yet.
- Me and turtlenecks are not friends.
- 'South Park' is so hilarious... I remember when it first came out: that show changed television forever.
- I just bought a Jeep painted like an American flag. No one better question how patriotic I am.
- So many parents these days are totally cool with their kids living on the couch the whole time. It's like a new thing with families. But you've got to leave the nest and get out there.
- I think what's cool about Slayer is no matter how old their albums are, it's the one band to me that their sound is immortal. It never sounds corny to me. You can go back and listen to some Pantera and Metallica albums, and you're like, 'OK, great music.' But Slayer, you go back, and they always sound fresh and hard as hell.
- My favorite album of all time is 'In A Major Way.' Look it up, it is a classic!
