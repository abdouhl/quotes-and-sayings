- My whole family's been in the business. My whole family is crazy.
- I think I'm very much an entrepreneur, but I know I have the ability to start a company in a lot of ways than other people who are more qualified because I have this existing brand as an actress.
- Emma Stone, I think, always looks beautiful.
- When I'm in a relationship, I give my heart and soul to it and do it 100 percent.

- Family is at the heart of everything I do.

- There are lots of actresses I consider to be my icons, from Katharine Hepburn and Grace Kelly to Diane Keaton and Meryl Streep.
- I have to learn to knit.
- I had a premonition when I was nine that I'd marry Leonardo DiCaprio.
- There are looks that I see on other people that I think would look horrible on me, but I think if somebody has the courage to be really daring and try something outlandish, then more power to them. That's just encouraging and inspiring.
- What do you do with your best friend? You do nothing.
- People just wanna talk. They wanna create negative things about you and your life and make up things. You can't let them affect you!
- I have smuggled so many ingredients across so many borders, like shallot confit from Thailand, or a new sauce from New Orleans not approved by the FDA.
