- I get up at 4:30 in the morning, seven days a week, no matter where I am in the world.

- When you think about it, media's the intersection of content and technology - it's all about storytelling, like photography and the camera.
- It's not about how much you make: it's about how good the quality is. You'll be better off as a company making fewer things and concentrating on those and how you bring those to market... in a very less cluttered way, even though the marketplace is more cluttered.
