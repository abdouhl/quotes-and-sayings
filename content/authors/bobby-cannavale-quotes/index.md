- My dad worked at a mechanical factory for 35 years. I grew up in Union City, NJ. My mother is a social worker. My sister runs a 7-Eleven, and my brother is a detox counselor. They had no predilection for the arts. But from a very young age, I really, really loved theater.

- I like that message for my own children that you don't have to go with the flow, go with the crowd. That you can be your own person. You can be an individual, and that's valid, and that's important.
