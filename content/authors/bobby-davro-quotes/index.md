- I think I have minor obsessive compulsive disorder. Everything has to be tidy and just right.
- People are always wanting to pull me up on my shortfalls. I try to battle against those and concentrate on how good things are.
- Even when I had a run of successful prime-time shows, I couldn't sit down and enjoy my success. I would beat myself up and scrutinise everything. I'm a natural-born worrier.
- If I don't get eight hours, I can't function, so I'm a great believer in power naps.
- Of course it was difficult accepting the change in TV trends. It all ended quite early for me. I was in my mid-30s, and I hadn't achieved everything I wanted. There's nothing on TV for people like me anymore. All they want are new young faces.
- When I was at my height on TV, I was always busy - rehearsing, practising my impressions, learning new material. When that faded, I had to find another way to be creative. Houses were something to do instead. They saved me.
- Despite my confidence and self-belief, I've always wrestled with feelings of insecurity. To be honest, I think most people in show business are insecure.
- I want to go on TV to perform. I'm not conceited, but I am good at what I do. It's just the vehicles are not there anymore.
- When work is going well, your home life struggles and vice versa. If my kids are OK - that is the most important thing. I strive for balance in my life, though.
- The measure of success is happiness and peace of mind.
- I'm too old to be humiliated on reality shows, and I don't want to look desperate. You won't see me on 'Big Brother' or in the jungle.
- As a family comedian, it is so wonderful seeing everyone from kids through to grandparents being entertained by you.
- Too much comedy is filthy these days. There's nothing they won't say. I like Jimmy Carr, but I don't like the language he uses. I don't understand why he feels it necessary; I find it extremely offensive.
