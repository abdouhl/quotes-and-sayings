- I remember sneaking a look at films like 'D.C. Cab' and 'Doctor Detroit' when my parents weren't watching. 'One Crazy Summer' with John Cusack was one of my favorites.
- It's not like you do 'SNL' and then get handed movie roles. You work, you audition for stuff and try to get it. I think, a lot of people, it's the goal to be in movies or just to be working in general. But yeah, some of us get lucky and get some movie roles, and it's nice.
- I think I made more money when I was lifeguarding at 15 years old than I did on my first year at 'SNL.'
- I think I'm a big kid at heart, so I get very excited around the holidays.
- I'm very bad with music. I don't know any new music. I've listened to the same 10 or 12 albums my whole life.
- I've worked with Method Man and Shaquille O'Neil on multiple occasions. I'd never have thought. It's like, 'Oh, those guys. They're my movie buddies.'
- There's a guy on YouTube named Mac Lethal - he spits hot fire.
- If you watched 'Lost,' sometimes the episodes were crazy good, and sometimes you're like, 'That one was just sorta there.'
- Me, Billy Crystal and John Goodman hang out non-stop, and all we do is silly voices. We hang out in a little closet and do voices together.
- These days with the web, you can burn out a character really quick.
- I come from an improv background, so the one thing I know when I'm doing 'Chozen' is that whatever he's doing at that exact moment is the only thing he's thinking about, and he will do it until he's conquered it.
- My mom makes something called green pie, which I thought was a delicacy that many people only had at Thanksgiving, but it turns out it was just Jell-O with whipped cream on it. And it's delicious.
- I'm very wary with impressions - I don't think I'm very good at impressions, I hate doing them.
- When I was at Upright Citizens Brigade, I would pretend to be a sad, drunk rapper.
- I'm not very big on politics. I'm a comedian and not that smart. I don't have the mind capacity for it.
- I grew up listening to a lot of Snoop Dogg and the Wu-Tang Clan. Actually, I was a huge Wu-Tang fan.
- I did a lot of theater as a kid because I had a bunch of friends who did it.
- I don't have a dark side as far as there is, like, murder in my past, but yeah, I think I'm a pretty nice, easygoing guy.
- I have this old-man character named Glary Oldman. His apartment was on fire, but he was stubborn about leaving because he didn't want to leave all his stuff. I have a character called Berle, who lost 19 pounds, and now he's 600 pounds and very happy about it.
- I never really read comics. I bought them, and I would draw them.
- 'SNL' is one of those jobs where you are constantly reminded of how lucky you are and that you get to meet some of these people whose work you enjoy. Then you get to meet them, and they are just wonderful people. It turns out wonderfully, and you have a great conversation.
- In my mind, not in real life. My rap name will be Optimus Rhymes. Or the Notorious B.o.B.
- I steal props from 'SNL' a great deal. Almost every sketch I'm in, I try to grab something from it, so I have a storage space full of props.
- My dad is quite possibly the biggest Giants fan in the world. I believe he wore a Phil Simms jersey to my high school and college graduations.
- My first 'SNL' episode was with Michael Phelps and Lil Wayne. And if you go back and watch the monologue - it was supposed to feature Barack Obama, but we couldn't get him - it was with William Shatner. But if you watch it, Guy Fieri is sitting in the front row.
- I was a bartender at a Pizzeria Uno's for nine years. The people I worked with were amazing, but it was quite possibly the most miserable time of my life.
