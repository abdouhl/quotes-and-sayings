- No Entry' is close to my heart.
- Sridevi was a part of the planning of 'Nerkonda Paarvai.' She was a part of the negotiations too.
- I grew up hearing about Raj Kapoor and K. Asif and the way they used to make films lavishly. We are dream merchants and we have got to sell dreams, which are lapped up by all.
- Look at her in 'Tevar.' Sonakshi has never looked more stunning. She lost oodles of weight especially to shoot the song 'Radha Nachegi.' Look at how gracefully she has performed the song. Very few contemporary leading ladies can carry off a semi-classical number so fluently.
- I am extremely happy and thrilled about 'Mom' releasing in China.
- There are no fixed notions on what I should pick up or follow, it has to first appeal to me.
- I am a friendly father.
- Professionally, South has contributed in whatever standing I have. And yes, personally, too, it has given the joy of my life, Sridevi.
- It's nice to introduce Vidya Balan to the Tamil audience.
- I am trying to be both mother and father to my children.
- It's too much of a responsibility, too much stress, and to do justice to Sri in my first film as a director would be really tough. We can't separate our personal equation and become professionals on the sets. So no, I'm not directing Sri in my first film.
- The taste of a multiplex audience in Amrawati is very different from the taste a multiplex audience in Nariman Point, Mumbai.
- I'm not a puppet in anyone's hands.
- There's huge potential in China. They have about 50,000 screens and they need content, which we produce a lot.
- I really feel elated and proud for the achievements of my children and my family.
- I can look after myself and my own.
- I am sure 'Shakti' will set the screens on fire.
- What can I say about Anil Kapoor? He is my brother and when I talk of him as an actor, I might sound biased. But I am not biased, I am very objective. I appreciate the fact that there are not many like him. There are not many who has his kind of totality.
- Delhi is fresh, brazen and more glamorous as compared to subtle Mumbai.
- You don't have to be a show-off to be patriotic.
- Shakti' moves on various levels - love in Canada, feudalism in India and, above all, a mother's fierce fight against her father-in-law to wrest back custody of her child.
- Hum Paanch' made Amrish Puri a star and he went on to play Mogambo in my 'Mr. India.'
- The acknowledgement of my family members be it my daughter or my son means a lot to me.
- We shot 'Tevar' in Mathura and Agra, 'Mom' was shot in Noida and Greater Noida.
- Mom' is my third film with my wife and there's a definite comfort level.
- Anything which is sweet, I couldn't resist but would pick it up and eat.
- I have my moments when I am down and low. But I gather myself when decisions are to be taken.
- When a filmmaker tries to make a good film and if he gets success in that then definitely it's a nice feeling.
- Unlike so many producers who sit in their offices and operate from there, I take pride in calling myself a creative producer.
- The kind of fan following that Salman has at the mass level is unparalleled. No one even comes close. So when he plays the Robin Hood or Chulbul Pandey sort of roles, people go crazy.
- I feel 'Mom' is not just a successful film but a satisfying one.
- A hero today must be Raj Kapoor, Sunil Dutt, Shammi Kapoor, Dev Anand, Dilip Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan rolled into one. These are the six hero slots in Hindi cinema and an actor must be able to play all if he wants a long innings.
- There are heroes and then there are legends, heroes get remembered but legends never die.
- Just like multiplex theatres, the industry had become divided, making films that alienated one kind of audience or another. It was really time to come out of the niche and make something that, at a certain level, clicked with everyone. 'Wanted' did just that. It opened the gates once more.
- It is a pleasure to cooperate with Egyptian cinema.
- One has to be honest to the story and choose actors accordingly.
- For 'Tevar' we chose Amit Sharma to do the Hindi version of the Telugu hit 'Okkadi' because we wanted to change the flavour and mood of the original.
- I don't think I can make a film without Salman. He is in 'Mr. India 2' and also in the sequels to 'No Entry' and 'Wanted.' I'm his new Sooraj Barjatya.
- India and Egypt have been strongly influencing each other's culture, arts and architecture since ancient times.
- U.P. is where I belong to, I was born in Meerut, so whenever I come here, I'm reminded of my childhood.
- I don't fear anything.
- She was my wife and I love her & loved her beyond imagination but I also respected her art, the passion and dedication with which she committed herself to her work.
- If I had my way, I would plan every film with Salman Khan.
- When doing a remake, you're on safer territory. You know you cannot go absolutely wrong. But how right it goes depends on various factors like casting and the way you adapt the film.
- Shakti' is a very loose adaptation of 'Not Without My Daughter.'
- Janhvi has her own individuality.
- Sahara Shree has put a lot of faith in me and I'm hoping to live up to his confidence.
- Sri is an introvert. She doesn't talk to strangers.
- As for me, my foundations were laid in the south. We did the post-production of 'Hum Paanch' in Chennai, with many technicians from here working for us.
- We are pleased to have acquired remake rights of 'Comali' for all languages in the world.
- We had to recreate the banks of the river Yamuna on a studio floor. It wasn't easy... or cheap.
- Nobody is as complete as her, my wife Sri.
- While producing a remake, one is sure of the success that it will have as the project has been tried and tested earlier.
- I fell in love with Sri when I watched her Tamil film during the late 1970s. After watching her film, I wanted to know more about her.
- I am like a common man who is dictated by what I like and I sometimes feel that if something good, I should produce it.
- Patriotism cannot be instilled inside anybody, it just happens to be there. And it can rise above any notion, any emotion.
- My passion for film-making was bordering indulgence. But gone are those days when I was adventurous.
- I am really happy that my daughter Janhvi has been honoured with the 'Arets Stjerneskudd' award as the rising talent of the year by Royal Norwegian Consulate General.
- I wanted to be different.
- I may have been in financial difficulties, but I'm not a pauper.
- I never had a preconceived notion about what I should do or what I should take up... I am not that intelligent.
