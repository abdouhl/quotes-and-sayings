- My main aim is getting set up so that when I do quit, I can step away and re-evaluate what I want to do in life. Do I want to get to 50 years old and come back? Or will I just want to go home and be fishing, hunting and working around the house?
- As a kid, I really wasn't thinkin' about no golf.
- There are some good teachers out there, but the only one who is a genius at diagnosing my swing is my mom. She took up golf late, when she was 39, but in her younger days, she was an amazing athlete. She never read an instruction book or took lessons, but she has a remarkable eye for motion.
- The Lord has blessed me to play this game. I'm going to try to play it as long as I can. But at the same time, I want to be able to watch my kids grow up, so I've gotten to where I'm a little more mild, and I don't take golf as seriously as I did in the earlier years of my career.
- I just never did like school.
- I enjoy the crowds. It's not that hard to talk to them, to have fun with them.
- The tour life is real tough on a marriage. To the young guy who is just getting his PGA Tour card and is in a serious relationship, my advice is to wait three years before getting married.
- It's just golf. As long as I get done without breakin' somethin' or hurtin' somebody, that's my goal.
- I don't care much for the cities.
- I want to play the Tour until I'm 46, 47, and then take about three years off, and then go play the Champions Tour when I'm 50. That's the plan, but you never know - it all depends on how good the fishing and hunting is.
- I like rice, as long as they let me put my own stuff on it. You can bring me white rice or brown rice; just let me doctor it up.
- I love the outdoors and looking at snakes, squirrels, bugs - just going through the woods and being part of it. You can smell the different trees. And I listen. There's so much you can learn by listening, by sitting and watching things happen.
- I bow hunt and rifle hunt. It just all depends on where I'm at.
- I've had a bunch of accidents. If you hunt, you're gonna have some accidents.
- I enjoy coming to Scotland, and my favourite memory has to be my first Open at Carnoustie. Coming over from a small town and playing in something so big to golf and y'all.
- The gossip mill on tour is always turning. I have to be a little careful about what I tell guys who I don't consider close friends, because even though they might not spread it to other players, they'll usually tell their wives. And once the wives get it, it's gone.
- I grew up with both my parents around me at all times, but my kids are not knowing who I am half the time.
- I'm not really a betting person. I work too hard for my money to give it away.
- Why would you want to go all the way to Africa and shoot a giraffe? I don't think you can eat him. I only shoot stuff I can eat.
- I ain't going to say everything I touch turns to gold or camouflage. I've got to work hard to keep what I've got. Nothing comes easy to me. It never has.
- I shoot the same rifle I've shot since I killed my first deer with it when I was nine.
- I don't follow golf! I don't keep up with golf or know who is coming or going. I am just here to play the game and be done with it.
- We hunt in Florida, where I live in Jay. I hunt in Alabama a little bit, on my uncle's land. I go to Illinois and hunt with some friends up there. I hunt in Mississippi and Missouri.
- Scotland's a pretty place. I mean, as long as it ain't raining.
- I played the mini-tours for a lot of years, and man, you see some weird things out there. There are a lot of desperate people, strange personalities and marginal players, and with that you're going to see some cheating.
- I thought I would just become a pro at a golf course.
