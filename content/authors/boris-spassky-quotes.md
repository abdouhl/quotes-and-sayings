- When I played Bobby Fischer, my opponent fought against organizations - the television producers and the match organizers. But he never fought against me personally. I lost to Bobby before the match because he was already stronger than I. He won normally.

- Bobby Fischer has an enormous knowledge of chess and his familiarity with the chess literature of the USSR is immense.
- Recently I saw Kasparov and he looked to me as still young and potent champion.
