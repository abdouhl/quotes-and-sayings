- Cubism is still the most important art movement for the same reason that John D. is still the most important Rockefeller.

- I don't get ideas, I have them. The trick is to remember where I've put them.
- Postmodernists believe that truth is myth, and myth, truth. This equation has its roots in pop psychology. The same people also believe that emotions are a form of reality. There used to be another name for this state of mind. It used to be called psychosis.
- Futurism: This was a movement of intellectuals who wanted to replace tradition with the modern world of machinery, speed, violence, and public relations. It proves that we should be careful what intellectuals wish for, because we might get it.
- Style is the most valuable asset of the modern artist. That's probably why so many styles are reported lost or stolen each year.

- If they were starting their careers today, Rockwell and Picasso would probably both be painting on black velvet.
- I didn't want to go to college - I was bored by junior high. So I was in church one day, staring at the stained glass windows and thinking about things, when suddenly I decided that if I could start selling cartoons to magazines, they'd let me quit high school.
- The truth is, we haven't really figured out yet how artists are going to thrive in modern mass societies. We're all experiments.
- In Modernism, reality used to validate media. In Postmodernism, the media validate reality. If you don't believe this, just think how many times you've described some real event as being 'just like a movie.'
- In America, the only truly popular art form is the movies. Most people consider painting a hobby and literature, schoolwork.
- Your biggest influences are the earliest ones. When I was young, I was very influenced by the short stories of Nathaniel Hawthorne.
