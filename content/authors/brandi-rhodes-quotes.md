- What I did sign was a tentative contract with Impact Wrestling when they were still Impact.

- I'm not one to say I'm gonna do something and not do it.
- Many times, I would be on live television and have no idea what the next match is, and I'd have no clue who was coming out next.

- Women are stepping up, they are performing, they are showing that we are athletes as well and we deserve the attention we are getting.
- Impact has always had a focus on their Knockouts. Back when WWE was not so focused on their Divas, Impact was still focused on their Knockouts. They were actually the stronger women's division for a long time, and that was the place to watch a match more than a couple of minutes.
- With Riho, she doesn't speak English. Is that something that's going to keep us from having her on our roster? No! She's incredible. She's got incredible heart, and very, very talented in that ring in many different ways.

- My first match was on television with no buffer, but I wouldn't have it any other way. I feel like I've learned faster than a lot of other people for that reason.
- Personally, I'm a fan of valets and managers.
- I know when someone is genuine, and I'm also a big believer in, if you aren't happy with something or you're not feeling passionate, God, you're not a tree, move. Go do something about it.
- I don't think I've said more than hi to Kenny King ever. And I think that's in part because 'The Bachelor' is a much different type of show than something like 'WAGS.'

- So making the choice to be involved in the pro wrestling industry is always looked at as a short-lived choice, and there are very few and far in between opportunities to continue a career in wrestling if your time is up as a wrestler, as a female.
