- We can bring positive energy into our daily lives by smiling more, talking to strangers in line, replacing handshakes with hugs, and calling our friends just to tell them we love them.
- I believe the only thing that we really have control over is our attitude. If we focus on the positive things in our lives and learn how to cope with all the surprises, we will be happier people.
- Every once in a while, there's somebody who will recognize me and want a picture, which is cool; it's flattering.
- Sometimes we let life guide us, and other times we take life by the horns. But one thing is for sure: no matter how organized we are, or how well we plan, we can always expect the unexpected.
- Life passes us by if all we do is focus on the future. Being present, for the present, is really what is important.
