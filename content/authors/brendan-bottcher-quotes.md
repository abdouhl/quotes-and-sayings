- I don't think it's bold to say we wanna win and I don't have a hard time saying that.
- I try to live my life that way - there's not a whole lot of point getting worked up about things you can't control, and especially a week like this. You play 150 ends of curling, there's going to be a lot of bad that happens in there.
- If you can act calm, that's step one in trying to convince yourself to be calm.
- If I can add a bit of a calming influence on the guys, then I'll certainly try to.

- I'm just fortunate I can compete with a lot of these guys that have been doing this on an elite level for 15, 20 years. I think it's just amazing we're even in the mix.
- The Canadian teams just have great training and great coaches and that's sort of why there's the expectation that they're going to win. But there's a lot of really good teams coming out of the European countries.
