- I took a gamble in becoming an actor and my dream job has been realised.
- When I was in my 30s, I was at the end of a long-term relationship and going through a very hard time. I'd had about 15 different addresses and a series of relationships. I thought, 'It's time to have a look at yourself.'
- If this TV success had come in my twenties and I'd become a heart-throb, I would have been very stupid. I would have got into a lot of situations that I really wished I hadn't.
- I'm single, I'm looking for something meaningful.
- By the time you've been single for quite a long time, you can get quite specific about what you can and can't put up with.
- It's not something that's at the forefront of my mind, but I think I'd regret it if I didn't have children.
- Acting meant so much to me.
- My dad was a master butcher and I trained to be a butcher when I left school. I didn't enjoy it at the time but I love cooking now, so perhaps I would have been a chef.
- I had to escape the destruction of my father's bankruptcy and all that difficulty.
- I left school at 16 but I wish I'd gone to university - I think I would have studied English literature. I had a knack for that. But I don't think you have the kind of wisdom at 16 to make that decision.
- You can't be a casual observer of something humorous - you have to engage, you have to find it funny for the relationship between actor and audience to work.
- Am I a household name? I still can't get my head around that.
- I think great humor lies in playing the truth of a situation.
- Britain's a funny place and there's a lot of funny people coming out of there and a lot of people are finding mediums to express themselves.
- Sometimes I think I missed out on things like travelling. I'd have been terrified of missing an audition. I didn't start a family because that's not something I take lightly. Acting meant so much to me.
- I'd seen a play of 'Richard III' in Coventry when I was 15, which sowed the seeds that you could act for a living.
- I can pretty much say all of us know when 'Downton' is going to end. This is a show with a finite life.
- I'm going to be 50 soon. I'm single, I'm looking for something meaningful. By the time you've been single for quite a long time, you can get quite specific about what you can and can't put up with.
- I think great humor lies in playing the truth of a situation. I see myself as a performer and that applies to a Greek drama or a modern comedy.
- I would have loved to have been a footballer like my great uncle Matt Busby, but I knew quite early on that I wasn't going to make the grade. Luckily I was told by the age of 13 that I wasn't good enough. That's not a bad thing. You see this 'X Factor' generation of kids now who don't accept that they're not good enough.
- The qualities I am looking for in Miss Right are intelligence and humour.
- You get a lot of people requesting photographs but I tend to keep myself to myself, pull my cap down.
- I'm more rooted in new plays and new writing.
- I see myself as a performer and that applies to a Greek drama or a modern comedy.
- I think with Sky and BBC Three and Channel 4, there are some great television platforms, and the stand-up movement in this country is phenomenal. It's like rock n' roll here. Britain's a funny place and there's a lot of funny people coming out of there and a lot of people are finding mediums to express themselves.
