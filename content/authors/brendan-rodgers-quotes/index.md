- You make mistakes in your life, especially when you're young.

- I went in to Reading with the full backing of the chairman, who was great to me, and I got 20 games. Even though it was a three-year project, and I was the guy who knew the club more than anyone, I got the sack after 20 games. Funnily enough, it had just started to pick up, but they lost their patience.

- How you succeed is how you deal with failure. Whatever way you dress it up, something hasn't worked.

- I love my work.

- Celtic are one of the great clubs of the world. There's a pressure here that's different. You have to win every game. There's not a club in England that has that.
