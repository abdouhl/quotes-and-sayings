- God loves you unconditionally, as you are and not as you should be, because nobody is as they should be.
- Put bluntly, the American church today accepts grace in theory but denies it in practice. We say we believe that the fundamental structure of reality is grace, not works - but our lives refute our faith.
- Too many Christians are living in a house of fear and not in the house of love.
- The dominant characteristic of an authentic spiritual life is the gratitude that flows from trust - not only for all the gifts that I receive from God, but gratitude for all the suffering. Because in that purifying experience, suffering has often been the shortest path to intimacy with God.
- Grace is sufficient even though we huff and puff with all our might to try and find something or someone that it cannot cover. Grace is enough.
- Define yourself radically as one beloved by God.
- I believe that the real difference in the American church is not between conservatives and liberals, fundamentalists and charismatics, nor between Republicans and Democrats. The real difference is between the aware and the unaware.
- The greatest single cause of atheism in the world today is Christians who acknowledge Jesus with their lips and walk out the door and deny Him by their lifestyle. That is what an unbelieving world simply finds unbelievable.
- My trust in God flows out of the experience of his loving me, day in and day out, whether the day is stormy or fair, whether I'm sick or in good health, whether I'm in a state of grace or disgrace. He comes to me where I live and loves me as I am.
- Ruthless trust ultimately comes down to this: faith in the person of Jesus and hope in his promise.
- The Word we study has to be the Word we pray.
- We have been given God in our souls and Christ in our flesh. We have the power to believe where others deny, to hope where others despair, to love where others hurt.
- Without exposure to potential failure, there is no risk.
- Sin and forgiveness and falling and getting back up and losing the pearl of great price in the couch cushions but then finding it again, and again, and again? Those are the stumbling steps to becoming Real, the only script that's really worth following in this world or the one that's coming.
- Suffering, failure, loneliness, sorrow, discouragement, and death will be part of your journey, but the Kingdom of God will conquer all these horrors. No evil can resist grace forever.
- Childlike surrender and trust, I believe, is the defining spirit of authentic discipleship.
- Our huffing and puffing to impress God, our scrambling for brownie points, our thrashing about trying to fix ourselves while hiding our pettiness and wallowing in guilt are nauseating to God and are a flat out denial of the gospel of grace.
- By and large, the gospel of grace is neither proclaimed, understood, nor lived.
- Trust is that rare and priceless treasure that wins us the affection of our heavenly Father.
