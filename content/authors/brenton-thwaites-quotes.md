- I studied drama at the Queensland University of Technology, which was amazing. I can't speak highly enough of that school.
- I went to college at QUT: Queensland University of Technology. I studied for a Bachelors in finance and acting.
- I was on 'Home and Away' for about three or four months. I loved it.
- I almost failed drama at school. I hated it. It was all about the history of theatre.
- My first job on the screen was 'Sea Patrol,' and that was quite intense, but I guess my first big break was 'SLiDE.'
- I haven't had the whole 'famous' thing happen to me yet, and I hope I never will. I like to sneak away in the corners and hide a lot.
- I was on a show called 'SliDE' when I graduated from college, and then that set the premise of my love for acting. It was so much fun. I was on set with my best friends every day. From that, I got 'Home and Away' and it was such a relaxed, friendly environment. Everyone's so kind and supportive.
- When I'm not acting, I'm at the beach. I like to spend a lot of time in the water, surfing.
- When I was 16 years old, I joined a drama group called North Queensland Academy of Dramatic Art under a woman called Maggie Shephard-King. She inspired me to audition for the role of Romeo in 'Romeo and Juliet.'
- I was fortunate because my mum shared my love of film with me, so we would go to the movies twice, three times a week, and we would watch movies at home. As a teenager, instead of going out, we would have these huge movie nights in. But I almost failed drama at school. I hated it. It was all about the history of theatre.
- It's weird when auditioning for roles, because a lot of my mates go out for the same roles. You don't want to know that you're beating someone to the role.
- I guess my break in America came a little too early. It would've been nice to have a few more years to find out what I'm like as an actor without a camera on my face.
- Every movie has its uniqueness. You just do your best and go with it.
- If I read a script and I like it, there's nothing that will stop me from trying to be in that movie.
- Hugh Jackman really inspired me as a kid. He's a cool Aussie guy who works very hard, and he's a fantastic actor. Obviously, he keeps really fit. He seems like he's happy acting. Who knows if he really is, but he gives you that impression.
- I want to go back home and make movies in Australia. There's so many stories that we haven't captured yet. In Australia, we cling on to whatever culture we have. We're such a multicultural country.
- I thought Leonardo DiCaprio was amazing in Baz Luhrmann's 'Romeo and Juliet.'
- My long-term plans are just to get as much experience as I can in Australia and try to make my own films.
- In 'The Giver,' I play a character called Jonas who is a member of this community called Changeless. In this community, everyone is kept at bay emotionally and physically. They receive an injection every morning to control them from feeling things like love and pain and all natural emotions.
- In Australia, we cling on to whatever culture we have. We're such a multicultural country.
- Growing up, I was always adamant that I would never do 'Home and Away' or 'Neighbours,' because as an actor you want to set your path as that serious kind of actor.
