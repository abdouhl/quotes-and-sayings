- I was very vocal about what I wanted to do at a very young age. I wanted to be inside of the television set. I didn't know being on TV was being an actor.
- It's just been a lot of hard work and lot of auditions. A lot of ups and downs, but a lot of ups, and I'm really happy for my downs, too. I'm really thankful.

- My whole thing as a performer is to affect people, whether I make you cry or I make you laugh. I would love to make you think.
- If you really want to be an actress, go to school. I think it's great what people are doing on YouTube, but don't forget to go to class. Have a vision for yourself, but don't forget to do the work.
- I love '80s rock music. I was fascinated with Stevie Nicks when I was growing up.
- I started off in drama, and there are so many women that I admire. Women in this industry are gladiators. Cicely Tyson, Viola Davis, Taraji Henson, Regina Hall, Regina King.
