- When it comes time to where the new album gets closer, I start singing the song a cappella; I'll preview it on my Snapchat and get creative with it - just kind of bringing everybody into more than just listening to the record on album.
- I had something to prove and went in the studio and started writing. I got into fitness and style and learned the whole craft. That was when I wrote everything on the album. I put out 'Don't Ya,' and it took off.
- 'Wanna Be That Song' has everything I want to say about love and about what I'm trying to be. I wanna be that part of your life, that song that means so much to you, the one that takes you back to that special place... the song that makes you laugh, the song that makes you cry when you need to cry, that makes you dance when you need to dance.
- A legacy for me is being a piece of the soundtrack of someone's life.
- I grew up listening to Frank Sinatra, riding in the car with my grandpa, and I was just intrigued by it.
- I was about to walk on stage at the Kansas Speedway - I was playing a NASCAR race - and I said to Scooter Carusoe, who was standing side stage, 'I want to write a song called 'Wanna Be That Song.' Then I put my earphones back in and walked right out on stage.
- I was onstage singing with Luke Bryan, and he started singing a song that we hadn't rehearsed. Both Luke and myself just winged it.
- I think everybody has somebody for them, and they're out there waiting for you somewhere.
- If I helped you through something or if I helped you find love or if I helped you find a way through heartbreak or whatever it is, then my job is done, and that's what I want to leave behind in this world.
- Connecting with your fans in that way is just the coolest thing, because I am very fortunate that my fans let me be very open on my social media - never really judge me for that or anything.
- I always give a lot of credit to Ronnie Dunn for making me fall in love with country music.
- I once took a date whitewater rafting and brought my entire band/crew along.
- I've always wanted to title an album 'Illinois.' I wrote the song, which was a very special song to me. The song isn't exactly about being from there, even though I am.
- I can't keep secrets for crap.
- I broke my uncle's toy as a kid and never told him about it.
- I'm so uncoordinated.
- Making an album is a long process, but it's a fun process.
- I don't really get starstruck much.
- From day one when you're singing, you're dreaming about making that first album and making your break into whatever music you want to break into.
- I think that it's awkward watching a video with your mom, particularly when you're making out with a girl or a sexy scene. I would rather be away from that!
- Chicago is definitely more of a country place now. The friends who I thought never in a million years would like country now are huge fans. I love that.
- I think when you sign a recording deal, you think, 'I'm going to put out a song and have a hit right away. I'll be a giant superstar. I can take over the world now.' But I put out a song, and it did OK. It wasn't like leaps and bounds.
- I'm writing all the time. I want to do this forever. I want to have a box set someday. I can't stop. The day I stop being inspired to write songs, I'll go sit on the beach - until I become inspired again.
- The biggest challenge, I think for any new artist, is patience.
- I grew up three and a half hours outside of Chicago, but people would call me a 'hick' or 'country boy.' Maybe it's because I talked with more of a country accent.
