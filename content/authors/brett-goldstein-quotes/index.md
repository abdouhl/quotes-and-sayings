- The film that I go on about and drive people mad is 'Don't Look Now' with Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland. It's the best married couple acting you have ever seen in any film, the way they are together.
- Quite early on when it came out, I was outside my front door and the man who lives opposite me ran across the street and he went, 'Ted Blasso! Ted Blasso!'
- Me and my dad, all we talk about is football. I do realize, for whatever our issues are and whatever repressions there may be, talking about football is how we communicate. He'll call me up and say 'This is what happened at the football.' But what he's also saying is 'I love you.'
- Here's what I think is good about 'Ted Lasso' and what I'm proud of in it, as a writer: It's about kindness and teamwork and empathy, and being curious and not judgmental, but it does all of that through storytelling and plot.
- I would rate my TV football skills as an amazing achievement by the editors.
- I'm a workaholic, is basically what we've discovered.
- I won't name them, but we have family friends who are professional footballers, so I grew up around these types. I was around when they retired, and I know how difficult that transition is.
- No one wants to stop paying football - it's just that your body can't. That's tragic.
- 'Ted Lasso' has affected all of us - affected the cast, affected the crew, affected the writers. You can't really make a show like this without being accountable, and looking at your own behavior.
- It's so funny, this thing of 'overnight success.' I've been doing this for 20 years, but yes, sure, it happened overnight!
- I end up talking with people about relationships very quickly, because I find them interesting, and everyone's got a take on it.
- I was a writer. I wrote on the show. We were in the writer's room and by about episode five, I started to think: 'I really understand Roy Kent. I really understand Roy Kent. I think Roy Kent is within me.'
- I think there's something weird about how we always say, 'It takes a village to raise a child,' but when it comes to our relationships, we believe in only one person to do everything. When you put it like that, that's mad.
- One day, I would love to make a horror film.
- I usually play a softer character.
- I just like making stuff.
- Film is a real good way to get deep with someone.
- Most love stories that we see on screen end at them getting together. It's the will they or won't they, and then they do and then we end.
- I've seen stuff that says be nice and I think: you're not showing me anything. You're telling me, like a Hallmark card: be nice, nice to be nice, innit?
- Your soul mate is the person you're going to love the most, but it doesn't mean you're suddenly going to be a different person.
- In America, I think most actors wish they were rock stars, but I think in England most people wish they were footballers.
- Everyone wants to be better because of making 'Ted Lasso' and the way we make it.
- If you write a script that people like, then people will do it.
- I grew up with a lot of footballers.
- I've always wanted to work with Ricky Gervais.
- If I'm not acting, I'm writing.
- I wouldn't recommend wearing tight Spandex for hours. It don't half chafe.
- It can be actually quite cynical to go, 'Isn't it nice to be nice to people?'
- I knew a married couple that had an open relationship last 15 years, and I was fascinated by it.
- I basically work all day on 'Soulmates' and then all night on Zoom on 'Ted Lasso,' and I can't complain because I appreciate how absolutely insanely lucky I am.
- I think everyone is interesting if you ask the right question.
- My Dad is finally proud of me. He always wanted me to be a footballer. He is a football hooligan, a true obsessive, if I had been born on match day he would not have been at the hospital, so for me to be able to at least pretend to be a footballer, means I'm finally allowed home at Christmas.
- Something I think is amazing about 'Ted Lasso,' and we didn't know if it would work, but it's funny when you think about it, in that it's quite unique, but from the responses that we're getting, it seems to be a show that people watch with their families.
- But I think the upside is hopefully people are slightly scared of Roy Kent.
- I'll always do stand-up.
- I think in every stage in your life, your view on what love means and what it is changes.
- Will Bridges, who is the co-creator with me, when we were working on 'SuperBob,' we were just talking about how we like to write about relationships. And we were talking about what love is. We were in very different stages; he was married and was about to have his first child, and I was kind of dating the wrong people.
- I like that 'Scrubs' is very funny and silly and broad, but also emotional and real - sometimes within the same scene.
- That's my ultimate goal, is work with the Muppets.
- 'Ted Lasso' is a show about a guy who is ignorant - he doesn't know anything about football. But he's not arrogant and he's not shouting people down.
- There are ways of swearing that express all of your love and emotions.
- The greatest thing for me is that my dad is a football hooligan. He's an obsessive football fan. And I think he wanted me to be a footballer and I wasn't. Instead, I probably disappointed him by going into the arts.
- As for Roy, I love playing Roy. I'm working at it, but I wish I had less of a care of what people thought of me, so that I could be more like Roy.
- I wanted to be a stuntman first, and I used to pretend to be Indiana Jones and jump off roofs and slide under garage doors. I was 29 at the time.
- I was making short films and putting on plays at school. I was also in love with my teacher, so yeah - I was the kid in 'Rushmore.'
- I've seen too many things where the end is, 'Well, you should've stuck to traditional values.' I think it was interesting to try to do something different with it.
- People have been really forced to face their relationships while on lockdown and then stuck in a house together.
- So in 'Ted Lasso,' which is an American show but set in the UK and most of the cast are British, I think that's what's interesting and what was a risk and what worked: there are two sensibilities.
- You've heard this phrase and I don't think I understood it until I was making 'Ted Lasso,' this thing of 'the sandbox.' It's like we build the sandbox, we have the characters, we've got the action figures, and Season 2, we get to play with them and move them around.
- Fame and success and awards should never be the aim. The aim should be: Are you enjoying the making of the thing?
- When they asked me, 'Do you want to work on Ricky Gervais' new series?' did I say, 'Hang on, I'll have a think about that. I'm very busy at the moment. I've got to do a gig above a pub for 10 quid tonight?' Of course I didn't! I said, 'Yes, please! It's the new Ricky Gervais show, for God's sake!'
- Without sounding pretentious, if you get the emotional truth right, then you're set. Then the funny stuff you can pile on as much or as little as you want.
- If I'm watching a heavy drama and there's no moment of people laughing, I always think that's not realistic.
- I love the love that you see for 'Ted Lasso,' but there's also, I think, a kind of simplification of the show. Particularly from people who haven't seen it and are only aware of the hype and probably get annoyed with it.
- I haven't had people chanting at me in the street.
- The secret is I get very little sleep, and one day, I'll probably explode.
- I think it's quite easy to get caught up in the discussions about a show that people are having. But you have to tell the story you were going to tell.
- I have genuine empathy for the fact that if you're a professional footballer, you've often started at three years old, you've been found, you've been scouted, you play, you play, you play, you make millions, you live this incredible life. And then you reach 35, and suddenly you have to stop doing it, and you haven't been taught anything else.
- I've been in and around football all my life, but I've never been good at it, which I think my dad was very disappointed by.
- I was in New York when they had the massive blackout - all of Manhattan blacked out. It was a year or two after 9/11, it was pre-smartphones, and everyone thought it was a terror attack. It was like the end of the world.
- With stand-up I could think of something now and say it onstage tonight. It's totally pure, I love it.
- I realized that I love the quiet bits in most superhero films.
- One of the reasons I'm proud of the show and think it works is that as much as Ted is nice and he's kind and he's passionate, his troubles are real. He doesn't exist in a vacuum. The world of 'Ted Lasso' isn't a fairy tale.
- When I ask 'What's the film that scared you the most?' I'm really asking 'What scares you the most?'
- Most people like making stuff. It gives you hope.
- The greatest thing about stand-up is that it is the opposite of making a film.
