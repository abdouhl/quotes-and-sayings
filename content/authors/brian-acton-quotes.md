- My mom started an air-freight company; my grandmother built a golf course. I have a certain degree of entrepreneurial risk-taking in my family history. Maybe that eventually rubbed off on me a little bit.
- When I joined 'WhatsApp,' I was 38 years old. Opportunity is available to us in all walks of life and at all ages.
- The best part of working with Facebook has been the cross-fertilization of ideas, people, and technology.
- In early 2010, we launched our first localized version of 'WhatsApp' for iPhone. It included Spanish and German language translations, to name a couple.
- 'WhatsApp' provides phone number-based messaging, and people asked, 'Isn't that what SMS is?' Yes, but SMS is expensive, antiquated, and what WhatsApp did was modernize and level that playing field.
- Building secure products actually makes for a safer world; many people in law enforcement may not agree with that.
- WhatsApp provides phone-number-based messaging, and people asked, 'Isn't that what SMS is?' Yes, but SMS is expensive, antiquated, and what WhatsApp did was modernize and level that playing field. For example, in Europe, if France wants to talk to Belgium, it's extraordinary costly because of border and telecom charges.
- FreeBSD has a nicely tuned network stack and extremely good reliability.
- Your insurance broker has your telephone number, but your insurance broker doesn't have your Facebook ID. I think they are very different modes of communication. Commingling them can come with risk and peril.
- I myself saw Yahoo become a $100 billion company and then become a $10 billion company, so you always have to look at valuations with a grain of salt and understand it is a point-in-time measure.
- Dealing with ads is depressing. You don't make anyone's life better by making advertisements work better.
- You have a certain identity that you present to the world on Facebook, and you have a certain identity that you present with the telephone, and they are different.
- Going public is 18-month process, while an acquisition is a 6-month process. Going public means going under so much scrutiny, regulatory approval, auditing, magnified 10 times. Having the stomach to do that isn't necessarily in my DNA. My DNA is building a product and a service.
- Companies that have been built and operated for a long time are the most successful companies.
- For me specifically, it was important to graduate. In my family, I was one of the first graduates. My mom did not have a college degree. My dad did not have a college degree.
- My DNA is building a product and a service.
- People want chat histories. They're a permanent testimony of a relationship.
- I think every acquisition is unique and different. The best strategy is to listen to the founders and follow their lead.
- Yes, I was a big math and computer geek, that's true. I was driven by the scholastic side of things. For me, it was all about what I could do with math and computers.
- There's a certain degree of speculation that goes into valuations. In so far as the market supports a valuation, everyone who gets a great one deserves it, but they should also be cautious because that speculation is temporary. I saw Yahoo go from $100 billion to $10 billion. It's not a long-term measure.
- WhatsApp will bring Facebook another billion users. We will be a billion-user product. Whether there is a direct valuation or an indirect valuation, there is value, and Facebook understands that well.
- When I worked at Yahoo, I saw a lot of acquisitions. Some succeeded, and some failed. I think I have learned from that.
- The phone is one hundred, one hundred and ten years old. There was a middle period where the government had a broad ability to surveil, but if you look at human history in total, people evolved and civilizations evolved with private conversations and private speech.
- I don't really want to be in the business of observing conversations.
- You never want to be in a position where you can't make payroll.
- It's not 100 per cent clear to me what's working about Snapchat.
