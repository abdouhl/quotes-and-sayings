- For me, it is about creating a career - I'm very interested in the sports side and want to continue to do more stuff in that. But ultimately, what I consider myself to be is an actor, and the more variety I can play will continue to round me out.
- I had a shih tzu dog for 12 years - we were different in size but he was certainly man's best friend, he was my little guy.
- For me, it was a lot of hard work doing theater eight nights a week around the country, going from job to job.
- Television is certainly a writers-led medium. They're the ones who are there, they're the ones that are conferencing or whatever, with directors coming and going.
- The show is called 'The Office,' and while it focuses on the people, the architecture of the space is very important.
- It was really tough as a kid going to a Braves game. It was a guaranteed loss. You're looking at 100 losses a year. I was a huge baseball fan, played it for quite a while. But when '91 happened, with Smoltz and Glavine, it turned around, and I will say it made it pretty sweet.
- I come from straight theater.
- I do have a childlike enthusiasm at times. I certainly enjoy life and get pleasure sometimes in childish things.
- I moved to Los Angeles, and 'The Office' became successful, and the charity/cocktail party circuit is really not my scene. But I played golf, and I started getting invited to charity golf events, and I just fell in love with the game ten-fold, and at a lot of these events, there were athletes.
