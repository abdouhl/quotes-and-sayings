- Good doctors exercise judgment. They make the call and - right or wrong - live with the consequences and learn from them. The redefined M.D. is flawed, but comfortable inside their own skin.
- The redefined M.D. is able to access the still, small voice that says I'm about to make a mistake - or I've just made one and I need to undo it before it's too late.
- Show me any health professional - great and not so great - who says they don't make mistakes or haven't made one in years, and I'll show you someone who has trouble admitting the truth.
