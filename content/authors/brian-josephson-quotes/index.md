- I read a book called 'The Tao of Physics' by Fritjof Capra that pointed out the parallels between quantum physics and eastern mysticism. I started to feel there was more to reality than conventional science allowed for and some interesting ideas that it hadn't got round to investigating, such as altered states of consciousness.
- It's not clear in physics why you can't see the future.
- I believe that we can 'sense' the future. We just haven't yet established the mechanism allowing it to happen.
- I think telepathy exists, and I think quantum physics will help us understand its basic properties.
- The events leading to the discovery of tunnelling supercurrents took place while I was working as a research student at the Royal Society Mond Laboratory, Cambridge, under the supervision of Professor Brian Pippard.
