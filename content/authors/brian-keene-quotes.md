- 'Ghoul' was what my world looked like, growing up in the late Seventies and early Eighties, and what I thought it looked like. A lot of my personal experiences went into it.
- Everything can be grist for the muse. Sometimes, writers draw on personal experiences. 'Ghoul' was just that.
- Don't just rehash what came before. Find new things to do with it, in your unique voice.
- I tend to spend a lot of time building characters that the reader will believe in and sympathize with.
- In late 2001, I contributed a short story called 'Castaways' to an anthology called 'In Laymon's Terms,' which was a tribute to Richard Laymon, who had passed away earlier that year.
- I've been a fan of 'The Defenders' since childhood, and Devil Slayer was always one of my favorite members of the team - especially during J.M. DeMatteis' wonderful run on the series.
- Being a writer involves writing. You've got to commit to sitting down and writing instead of Xbox or Netflix.
- 'Castaways' was a play on what if a reality show like 'Survivor' was unknowingly set on an island inhabited by a sub-human race of creatures? Readers have often asked me to consider turning the short story into a full-length novel. So I did.
