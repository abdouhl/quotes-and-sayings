- A literary critic is someone who can't write, but who loves to show he would have been a wonderful writer if only he could!
- We've got one life and the older we get the more we come to realize how short it is.
- Now, after 18 years, not a sign of Lovecraft in my work.
- But there's a little guy who sits astride my brain with a whip, and if I'm away from the machine for more than a couple of hours during the day, this little guy's lashing away.
- If I had killed Crow off I can think of least six novels I would never have written, 400,000 words' worth of very necessary experience.
- But I've found that to talk too much about movies is the kiss of death. If it happens then it happens, is all.
- There are lots of other things that I haven't done, places I haven't seen. So eventually I'll have to find time for those things while there still is time.
- The amazing thing now is that most of those so-called critics who were telling me to find my own voice seem to have lost theirs.
- The Army was my bread and butter.
- German readers are much like Brits or Americans: They read for the thrill of it, the occasional shudder down the spine, knowing it's not real - but looking over their shoulders anyway, just in case.
- I'll know when the ideas aren't fresh anymore. And I'll know when writing doesn't give me a thrill anymore.
- And I have to consider myself fortunate, because there are plenty of writers who spend most of a lifetime looking for that certain something without ever finding it.
- Now, when I was in the Army, writing was my hobby.
- Writers are in the entertainment business, and it gives me lots of pleasure to entertain my readers.
- I have friends who read my books in Greek.
- I should think just about every young writer - which I was at the time - would be influenced by HPL. As an American writer of weird fiction, he was at the top of the class.
- But other vampire stories? Well, no, I really haven't read too many, and I can't say I'm crazy about romantic vampires anyway - to me the vampire is simply an evil monster.
- If, like Harry Keogh, I could talk to the dead - God, there are an awful lot of people I would like to speak to! Not least my father. Being in the army for 22 years, I didn't see enough of him, and I know there are a great many things I could have learned from him.
