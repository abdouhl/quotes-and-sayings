- I always thought when I hit 50 years old that'd be it for the travel. I don't have to tell you - you wait at an airport, your flight's delayed, get on a 14-hour flight, get off, get stuck in traffic, you get to the hotel and the room service is closed.
- Mark Winchester has left the band. He's decided that he's tired of the road and just wants to concentrate on his career in Nashville. I don't blame him at all. He'll certainly be missed.
- The songwriting has never really stepped forward from the '50's.
- We weren't afraid to mix some crazy styles into the standard rockabilly look. We also took a lot of different musical influences that were part of that era.
- The biggest challenge for me was Get Rhythm. I don't know why.
- I wanted to go back to Sun. Unfortunately, most of the gear is gone from Sun. The way I take it now, it's almost like a tourist destination. So, it would have been pretty difficult to have brought all the gear into Sun to make it like it was in the '50's.
- Rock and roll and swing never quite mixed. Rock and roll came in and just blew everything out of the water. Big bands were dead.
- I basically sat down for a month, with all the Sun stuff I could find and just picked out my favorites. I didn't think that they were indicative of '54 to '57, although I tried to stay within that period.
- Robert Plant is one of the nicest people you'll ever meet, never mind rock star. He's so down to earth.
- People out there maybe know who Junior Parker is and some of those Sun Records blues guys.
- I love Glen Campbell. He never gets a mention.
- I started a big band when grunge was popular. I mean, that didn't make much sense.
- To me, rockabilly music paralleled punk's energy and feeling, but the players were much better.
- Don't be afraid to take liberties with this music. Try and put some of yourself into it.
- Since the big band started I'm just always swamped with movies and things. It certainly pays the bills and it's very satisfying, because I get to write all these big charts and all this crazy music.
- If you listen to everybody's opinions, I mean, I always say I'd be digging a ditch on the side of the road now if I had listened to what everybody told me what to do. You know, you have to follow your heart, you have to.
- For every rockabilly festival staged here, there are 10 held overseas.
- I can't tell you how many people have asked me to show them Stray Cat Strut and that little diminished run on the C. I guess my brain is wired backwards. I don't know what possessed me to do that, but I did.
- It is hard to play Blue Suede Shoes. I know everyone has heard it 10 million times, and that makes it even harder to play it, but there's a very laid back tempo on that. I was surprised at how slow it really was.
- I didn't want to take the guitar solos down note-for-note, but more or less use them as a map, and keep all the hooks from the guitar playing, and let myself come through.
- I like a good pompadour.
- Normally, you go into the recording studio, make a record and then take it on the road and you think... wow... I could have done THIS to it, or something.
- I'm not God's gift to rockabilly. There's great players out there, and some of them deserve a lot more than they've gotten.
- Veteran performers are dying off, and new acts simply aren't emerging on the national scene.
- To keep creating something with this type of music, you have to take it out of the box.
- It's not about how loud you turn the amp up. That's not what makes it sound big. What makes it sound big is fooling around with different delays and reverb settings.
- A lot of people put all that stuff on a pedestal, and they won't touch it. But I don't think that's the reason they did that. I think they played that stuff out of pure joy.
- I put a metronome up to all the songs, and I tried to really keep it true to the original tempos.
- With the Stray Cats at least, we really took the music somewhere else. First, we wrote our own songs. That's a real weak point in modern classics if you do rockabilly or blues.
- Elvis is not so difficult as Johnny Cash because his voice is so distinctive. If you try to copy Johnny Cash, it's just going to sound dumb.
- The jazz chord substitutions in a country song... that was another thing that bent people's ears. I guess that my favorites are the unique ones. It's not how fast you play. It's that unique blending of different stuff I'm most proud of.
- Just because you put super great musicians together, it doesn't mean you're going to have that chemistry as a band.
