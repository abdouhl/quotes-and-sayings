- I think it's incredibly cute when a guy can't dance and doesn't care about how crazy he looks.
- Hip hop classes and ballet are what I've been keeping up with, and of course my usual abdominal workout, which consists of 500 sit-ups a session. Or I take a 30-minute abs class at my gym. But dance classes are a full-body cardio workout, which always brings me success and keeps me feeling great.
- I don't date dancers, but I've always wanted to teach guys how to dance.
