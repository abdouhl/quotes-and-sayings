- The first game I remember being ridiculously passionate about was Super Mario Bros. 2. It was the first game where you could play as Princess Peach. It wasn't just a game where the boys had their adventure. Peach was in the game and she was so powerful there.
- Crises like the Mirai botnet can't be prevented by vague calls to protect our cybernetworks or platitudes about working with private industry. We need to be able to force recalls on consumer devices with massive security vulnerabilities.

- I say this as an engineer: We are profoundly bad at asking ourselves how the things we build could be misused.
- It's not like I'm advocating that we ban 'Call of Duty' or anything silly like that, I'm asking is for companies to look at their hiring practices, to hire more women... and make sure they portray women in their games in a socially responsible way.
- To stand up to GamerGate, that's my choice. I can't make that choice for the women I work with.

- In some ways, the real damage of Gamergate is pushing the public's idea of sexism so far to the extreme, that changes in the professional sphere seem unimportant.
- With major films costing hundreds of millions of dollars to make, Hollywood is an industry that tends to repeat patterns when they make money.

- The truth is, the game industry is a really incredibly difficult place for women to work.
- Even in the '80s and '90s, many white Southerners were still bitter about court decisions that required racial integration of the schools. It wasn't that they were outwardly opposed to white and black people attending school together, it was that the rulings threatened their proud identity as independent Southerners.
- It doesn't matter how many women we get into game production. If the only people evaluating the work we do continue to be men, women's voices will never be heard.
- The truth is, you cannot run a political campaign like a tech startup. Technology is a field that fetishizes disruption. The old ways are suspect, and we place an almost irrational trust on new tools. That's fine for developing games, but it was a failing playbook for politics.
- The Internet has done so much for so many. It allows women and minorities to have access to education, training, and information that sometimes isn't available to them for whatever reason.
- There's a common misconception about running for office. People think it's dreadful, morally compromising work. But I've found the opposite is true. It made a better person and a better feminist. It forced me to take a hard look at my shortcomings.

- A lot of people don't know this about me but actually I started in politics.
- Sometimes I speak out on women in tech issues.

- Entrepreneurship is in my nature.
- Growing up as a queer child in Mississippi, I got my Nintendo in 1985, and I've been lost in this world ever since. When I was scared because my church said people like me were going to burn in hell, 'Final Fantasy,' 'Dragon Warrior' and 'Super Mario' offered a lifeboat.
- For a hate group originally focused on video games, anger over a comedy movie for starring women might seem ridiculous. But at its core, Gamergate is about a toxic male sense of ownership over geek culture.

- Something that's hard for me, I remember being a child in the '80s and looking at this field. It was a field I wanted very much to go into, but I didn't see people who looked like me working in video games. You can't really be it if you can't see it.

- Let's not glamorize abuse.

- I am a software engineer, a popular public speaker, and an expert in the Unreal engine.

- With my company, Giant Spacekat, I was very angry about the lack of games that portrayed women positively in the video game industry, so I launched my own studio, gave a lot of very talented women jobs, and we made some of the most awesome, empowering games in the business.
- The cost of speaking out is so high for women, I understand why most decide not to.
- It's sad when 'Grand Theft Auto' has more consequences for criminal behavior than real life.
- The truth is, the sexist behaviour that really holds women in games back doesn't come from the moustache-twirling cartoon villains of Gamergate. It's the sexist hiring practices of our journalistic institutions. It's the consistently over-sexualised designs we see.
- Gamergate isn't the problem - it's a symptom of an industry that is deeply sexist and unable to understand it.
- If you don't know what Gamergate is, my God, do I envy you.
