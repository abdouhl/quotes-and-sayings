- It's fun playing a more feminine part. I can identify more with a woman of passion and emotion than with a cartoon character. Who knows what a cartoon feels?

- I've been put up in great hotels from a very young age, so I've been spoilt. What I can't stand is when I arrive somewhere and the room isn't ready.

- Being a mother is the best thing that ever happened to me. Before you have your first baby you are a girl and then you become a mother. There is no transition into being a woman; you literally become a mum and being a mum means you always love someone else more than yourself and it is an unexplainable situation.

- I was shooting a bikini promotion in Mahe in the Seychelles in 1980 when there was a military coup and I, along with a roomful of other people, ended up being kidnapped and held hostage at gunpoint in a windowless room with no ventilation for 36 hours.
- Being cuddly has nothing to do with size.
- When my dad died, it was as if my mum died, too.
- I would hate it if my four boys were bullied as I was.
- Who says I'm gonna marry another guy? In Europe it's not like in America, where you set a date.
- In Denmark, when you marry, whether you have $1 million or just $10, you share it.
- I like to be controlled, but that doesn't mean controlled like a dog.
- Whether you go to Turkey or Mexico, China or Australia, find time to involve yourself with the people you're dealing with.
- People think I'm strong as hard as I look. But I've a very sensitive side and need to be loved by everyone.
- I'm 48 now and I would like to have another baby. I would love to because of all the things I have learned. It would be like starting all over again. But am I too old? I'm young at heart and I would be different this time round.
- I know I will be breaking a taboo. But I'm sure that it will provoke a new discussion. It's time things change. I feel 30 and want to look that way again.
- Certain men get intimidated and insecure around me. They can never get over the fact that I am taller than they are, but it really shouldn't matter.

- I've covered a lot of ground geographically and emotionally and for years I lost my connection with my family. But the best comfort you can have, whether you are on the phone or sitting there in the living room with them, is with your parents, and to me family has always meant protection. When you smile you get a smile back, unconditionally.
- A lot of women say, 'I look good thanks to magic creams,' but that's a joke.

- I'm very outgoing. I have a lot of energy.
- A tall woman can be just as feminine as a petite woman.
- The way some papers write about me, you'd think I was some kind of gold digger. The truth is, I've always earned my own money. Before I became a model in Europe, I even worked in a bakery store - for $1.50 an hour. It's a big jump from a bakery store to driving a Mercedes in California, but I'm the same person inside.
