- When I first came into the league, I didn't want the ball in my hands.
- When I first came out, I kinda overdid it. I dressed extremely older-boyish, like sagging, and big shirt and big jeans. I was just like, 'I'm gonna go extreme.' And then as I got older, the baggy clothes got a little more fitting to my body, but still masculine.
- Most athletes act all unhuman and you can't relate to them. I'm the exact opposite.

- I stand out in the world and I love that about myself.
- When I first started playing basketball, my coordination was horrible! I went into high school at 6 feet and left at 6-7 and then grew another inch in college. Catching the ball, it was bad. I've always been pretty athletic, but when I got really tall, I just felt awkward.
- I don't have a soft voice. People say I have a deep voice, and yeah, I do.

- I've had girls say that because of watching me, they're playing sports. And it wasn't just basketball all the time. I definitely feel like I'm helping the girls get out there and want to play. Especially with my style - it's not always 'girly.' I'm showing they can go out there and hang with the boys.

- My life is definitely different than it was in college.
- Short shorts are not for everybody.
- I've had moments when I questioned my place in the world. At times, especially in seventh grade, life was lonely and I'd often feel sad. I never wanted to deny who I was, but dealing with the sadness and the anger that came from people constantly making fun of me wore me down at times.
- I used to do the whole baggy, hard-core, I'm-a-boy look. Then I went through a preppy phase.
- Once I came out in sports, I basically told myself, 'I'm coming out, officially. I wanted to be able to look in the mirror and tell myself that I was being true to me. I wanted to help the younger me, when I was a kid, give them somebody for them to look up to.

- I want to go as hard as I can, and if I look like a guy out there playing ball, well, hey, I feel sorry for the opponent.

- I would love to be an ambassador for Baylor, to show my school pride, but it's hard to do that - it's hard to stand up and say, 'Baylor is the best!' - when the administration has a written policy against homosexuality.
- We won the national championship. We went 40-0 - the first men's or women's team in history to ever do that.
- We don't talk about things, and in certain communities we really don't talk about our feelings. It's just, 'Put it in a box and forget about it, push it to the back.' That's something I think has hurt us as a society.
- Just to know I have so many fans out there buying my jersey means a lot. It means I'm doing something right.
- When I went to Baylor on a basketball scholarship - and when I thought about the future as a freshman - one achievement I wanted more than any individual award was a national championship.

- Anybody that's different, be who you are. You never want to change that.
- People say the league is changing and they say your name - it lets you know you're doing something right.
- Footwork is the foundation to my offensive game. Being able to move, pivot around and dribble better were the big things I wanted to add to my game, as well as stretching out my game so I can shoot away from the basket better.

- I'm not the only female that wears men's clothes, so I'm not one in a million.
- I think more people should be open to talking about mental health issues. Instead of holding in so much.
- I've spent too much of my life being made to feel like there's something wrong with me. And no matter how much support I felt as a basketball player at Baylor, it still doesn't erase all the pain I felt there.
- I've always been really open about my sexuality and who I am. I never thought a big coming out was necessary.
- When you're confident, you're going to do things a little differently. You're not going to be hesitant to take a shot, you're not going to be hesitant to make a certain move.
- I'm used to having two or three people around me every time I get the ball.
