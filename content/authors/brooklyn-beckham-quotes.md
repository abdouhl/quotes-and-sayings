- I actually really enjoy cooking. Gordon Ramsay taught me how to do a great beef Wellington.
- I love going to football matches, the skate park, and music festivals.
- I love football, but I'm also very passionate about photography and film.
- My parents are strict, but the most important thing they have taught me is to be humble and kind and to always treat others as I would like to be treated myself.
- I love taking photos of all of my family, but Harper is really cute to photograph, and my brother Romeo because of his shaved head. Cruz is just cheeky, so it's always fun to get a picture of him, too.
- I don't really ask to take pictures of people. I kind of just get in their face.
- I couldn't believe it when Penguin offered me the chance to publish a book.
- I really respect fashion, but I don't follow trends to be honest, I'm much more into skateboarder style clothes, but I really like fashion photography, portraits, and stuff like that.
- I started working a Saturday job at this French cafe from when I was about 14. I lived two minutes away from the cafe and went there every morning. One day, the manager asked if I wanted to work there. I'd never worked before, so thought I'd give it a go.
- I'm kind of selective of the people that I take photos of. Like, I don't take pictures of just my friends, but I do like taking pictures of just some of my close mates, especially out in L.A.
- I feel like I get opportunities that most people my age don't get. But, like, I can't do what most 18-year-olds do. Like, I can't go out partying all the time: I have to work and get up early.
- Everyone kinda knows me as David and Victoria Beckham's son, and it doesn't, like, annoy me; I just kinda wanna make my own name for myself.
- I'm studying art and photography, like film and digital - a mix of both.
- Everywhere in New York is cool to see and cool to photograph.
- I went to a football game, and people were shouting my dad's name, and I was like, 'What? Oh my God.'
- My favorite outfit is like a 'Peaky Blinders' kind of look. I have a really old-man style.
- I studied photography in high school, and straight away, I knew it was something I was interested in.
- I'm nervous about moving away from my family. That's one thing that I'm really scared of, but I feel like it'll be good for me to live on my own for a bit and really knuckle down on what I really love and study.
- My dad bought me a camera, and I started taking it everywhere with me. I realised how much I was enjoying the whole process - from taking the images to editing them and developing them - and it soon became a complete passion.
- I don't really plan anything in my life, to be honest. I just kind of go with it: whatever comes comes.
- My mom likes getting her photo taken.
- I want to really study and learn about fashion, and kind of discipline for a few years, really start to study, and then probably start my photography career. I feel like that'd be really good for me - to disappear for a few years.
- I prefer black and white and portrait photography. I like old, you know, interesting faces, so I think black and white brings out the contrast.
- I love Steven Meisel and David Sims' work, I think they're both amazing photographers. I want to be at the same level as them one day.
- I felt very humble when my parents took me to meet Stephen Hawking.
- My dad's always taught me how to do stuff on my own.
- I'm not great with words.
- When I go out, I kind of put a hat on and glasses, so I'm kind of just like a photographer going around taking pictures, and people hopefully don't recognize me. But sometimes they do, and then I'll do a photo for them, too.
- I kind of live in the moment.
