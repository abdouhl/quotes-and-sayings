- You're always going to have fans, and you're always going to have people that hate you. The people around me, they know who I am, and that's really all I care about.
- I've played the game for 23, 24 years. Four months off, I'm not going to lose it.
- I'm usually out there grinding. You see a birdie go up on the board, and you're not thinking about how it affects the tournament because you're playing.
- At home, I'm definitely not watching golf. I'd rather be watching baseball, basketball, football, whatever it is.
- I think of three things, and that's it. Just keep it short and take it outside and swing it left.
- I just think pressure is all what you put on yourself.
- It was very frustrating, sitting on the couch, not doing anything. I couldn't pick up anything with my left hand. I was in a soft cast all the way up to my elbow. It wasn't fun. A lot of TV. I don't wish it upon anybody.
- I'm not somebody who's going to panic if things go the wrong way.
- I got into a car accident and couldn't play baseball, hockey, and basketball. We stuck with golf for a little while, and it's panned out. I think it was a blessing in disguise.
- I play fairly aggressively week to week and fire at a lot of pins. So I might miss more greens than other pros, but I'm still only a few yards from the hole when I do. That being said, when I really need to hit a green in regulation, I'm confident in my swing.

- Sometimes your haters are your biggest motivators.
- Being in the fairway, I think the fairways are a little bit more overrated.
- My expectations have always been to be one of the top players in the world, and that matches well with Paylocity's mission. They are changing things in their industry just like I want to make a mark on professional golf.
- My goals? They're pretty high.
- I'm pretty chill.
- You tell me I can't do something, I'm going to do it.
- The U.S. Open just takes so much discipline. You have got to be a great putter and just kind of let things roll off your back.
- As long as every tournament, every year, you're getting better and better, that's all that matters.
- I have a lot of self-belief.
- When you're out here grinding away, firing at some flags, firing at the middle of the green, you just got to be very patient, and I always do a pretty good job of that in the majors.
- Being 21, 22 years old... traveling the world and getting to play golf is pretty neat.
- I just kind of keep doing what I'm doing, keep plugging away, kind of hide behind closed doors sometimes, which is nice, kind of the way I'd like to keep it.
- Records are meant to be broken, I guess.
- I learned how to play golf over in Europe; I learned how to manage being on the road.
- I love travelling. I'll go anywhere. I think it's so much fun.

- I could have played in a lot of Monday qualifiers for PGA Tour events, which would have been fine as long as I was getting through. But Monday qualifiers can also be depressing if you are missing out time and again.

- Golf's my job; it's not my life. It's something I've enjoyed, but I also like to get away from the golf course.
- A question I get asked a lot in pro-ams is how I'm able to swing the club as hard as I do. Honestly, I'm not swinging that hard. I'm using about 75 percent of my maximum effort.
- It's pretty obvious when Tiger makes a birdie. I think everybody at the golf course cheers for him.

- Sometimes you just need to be put in your place, I think.
- There are a lot of things that people love, they just can't do for a living.
- A lot of golfers take the club back with almost no upper-body rotation - they're all arms. And even when they do rotate back, it's usually on a flat shoulder plane. If your shoulders turn back fairly level with the ground, it's hard to swing down from inside the target line and hit an accurate shot.

- Sitting on that couch eating and gaining 20 pounds isn't exactly fun - there's only so much you can do.

- You can't hide when you're on the top of the leaderboard. You can't hide my name.

- If you look at some of the strongest athletes in the world, they're gymnasts. And they're the most flexible. You can be very strong, very flexible, and still be able to move.
- Anytime you can get some congratulatory - anything said or the guys waiting around the green - that's always nice. You're out here so many weeks a year, and sometimes away from your family, and the tour kind of becomes your family. So when you have these guys hanging around, it's special.

- You always feel like you've got something to prove, whether it be to yourself or somebody else. I can think of plenty of people along the way telling me I'll be nothing, working at McDonald's, doing things like that. The whole time, you're just trying to prove them wrong.

- I'm just focused on me.
- I see the young guys coming out of college. They are bombing it past me. They hit it so far, they are leaving me in the dust.
- St. Andrews is my favorite place to play golf. I've said it many times. I love the design. I love how there is always a bunker in play. And every time you play, it is always a little bit different. There are so many angles out there. It is beautifully designed. And so much fun to play.
- I honestly just want to take a selfie sometimes.
- There are some things you have to accept come with being really good at something: more attention, more eyes on you, every move you make - whether good or bad, you have to answer. If that's the price of where I want to get, it'll be worth it.
