- I actually thought, like, I was sure 'Get Smart' and, like, 'James Bond' movies, I was sure that that's what real life was like.
- In many ways, cartooning is my therapy. I've always said they're like my diaries. It's thoughts and feelings and things I've seen on any particular day.

- I loved Charles Addams more than anything. Still love him.
- I've had mostly book parties, where I get very focused on inviting everyone and not forgetting anyone, although of course one always does, and being worried no one will show up, but mostly the book comes from going to parties and feeling very, for lack of a better word, anxious.

- It's not like during your normal day, anyone says, 'How do having meaning in your life? How do you make meaning in your life?'

- I started doing a Twitter feed when my father was dying. I was very distracted, preoccupied. It was upsetting.
- I started trying to be a writer and failed for years. I tried novels, short stories, sitcoms, movies, plays, anything. And then, to support myself, I had millions of jobs on the fringes of show business.
- I'm continually working on myself. Nothing ever actually works.
- My mother couldn't take having three boys. She was extremely jumpy, to say the least. Any noise startled her. The sound of a pot dropping on the ground could make her hit the ceiling.

- When I was a kid, and I was watching TV, I just loved it so much that I wanted to crawl into that TV.
- James Thurber was an inspiration because his drawings were so primitive. I am self-taught - I didn't go to art school - so I thought when I started doing them, 'If James Thurber can be a cartoonist, I can,' because his stuff is very raw.
- Sometimes I'll be reading something online and just get so frustrated because of what people are saying.
- I read the 'New Yorker' when I was a kid. I used to love the cartoons and pick the cartoons out of the library, so I felt I knew the world of their cartoons.

- We are all just little dolls of ourselves. Who occasionally pull back the curtains to reveal the real us.
- I never really got into 'The Munsters' that much, but there was one aspect that was compelling. That was Marilyn. She was the only normal one among this group of creatures.
- As an adult, it's hard for me to remember my mother before her sickness. But if I go back into childhood, I can access that.
- In New York, all the crews read 'The New Yorker.' In Los Angeles, they don't know from 'The New Yorker.'
- In Los Angeles, it's always nice out. In New York, it can be nice out or horrifying. You really have no idea what you're going to get on any given day.
- Of course I loved 'I Love Lucy' and saw every episode over and over again. I found it heartbreaking that Ricky got to be famous and have an exciting life at the Tropicana while Lucy was stuck in that terrible apartment with the Mertzes.
- There was never any butter in our home. Just margarine. My parents acted like butter was lethal. I don't think I ever saw either one have a piece of butter. I would go over to friends' houses and down sticks of butter.
- I've had to whine for everything I've ever really wanted.
- I was trying to be a writer, and I was kind of getting sidetracked, so I started doing cartoons as a form of expression.

- Actually, I think that 'Seinfeld' tackles the same kinds of issues as 'Six Feet Under,' just in a different way.

- I go through my day remembering things like telephone cords.

- I can't get enough of self-help books of all kinds.
- What I like about graduation speeches is that they're an opportunity for someone to make sense of their life and to impart that wisdom to someone else. It's like a sanctioned self-help moment.
- Yes, the people I draw don't have a wide variety of looks. Every now and then I'll spruce it up, like a woman will be wearing a two-piece suit as opposed to a one-piece, or a man will not be wearing a tie; he'll just have a collar.
- When I was a kid, I would be watching TV shows like, you know, like 'Get Smart' and be like, 'That's what being an adult is.'
- I love graduation speeches. I have always loved them; I will always love them.
- Graduation speeches force you to reflect. They are about consciousness. Nothing is better than consciousness.
- I used cartoons as diaries. I still do. They're my way of figuring out the world, what's happening to me or what I'm thinking about.
