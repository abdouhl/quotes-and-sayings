- People think that because I was at Liverpool for such a long time - in a period where the club was very successful - that it was bliss all the way.

- The fans called me Jungleman. They said this young guy's not white. He's black in a white man's skin.

- Liverpool is a family, it is not a club, you don't come in and out of this club without it leaving a mark.
- Growing up in Africa teaches you to become patient.
- Liverpool had African players from the '50s and '60s. There were goalkeepers in the early days from South Africa. Then in 1981 there was a guy who came to Anfield. They say 'who is this guy' and it is me; I am African.

- I still have dreams about Hillsborough. Well, nightmares, anyway.
- I've likened Mignolet to worse than Dracula because at least Dracula comes out of his coffin now and then. He seems to stay on his line and that's it.

- An injured Gerrard is still better than many fully-fit players.
- Going through my time as a coach in Zimbabwe and in South Africa, I know for a fact if there is anything dodgy in a game, look at the three people in black. They are the catalyst.

- Alisson is undoubtedly one of the best goalkeepers in the world and he deserves to be put on that pedestal. Him and Manuel Neuer are probably the best two when it comes to angles - those two are the very best in the world at getting their angles right, they don't have to dive because they aren't out of position.
- I've had a lot of things thrown at me. A lot of coins that had been sharpened, billiard balls, and I had a dart thrown at my back at Burnley. And potatoes with razor blades.

- I mentioned that Mignolet is bad at coming for crosses and as soon as that went into the newspapers, he got better.

- I enjoyed 13 successful seasons at Anfield, becoming the most decorated goalkeeper in league history. But I believe the match-fixing scandal arose because the press did not like this person they perceived as arrogant and who had a reputation for clowning around in games. Goalkeepers aren't supposed to do that.
- I can only say sorry for the past. I can't change it.

- Life is too short to sit around doing nothing.
- Jurgen Klopp was very astute in seeing Keita's ability and potential to develop.

- It can be daunting playing in front of the Kop.
- The biggest memory I have is the 1984 European Cup final against Roma and my 'spaghetti legs' routine during the penalty shoot-out that won us the trophy. People said I was being disrespectful to their players, but I was just testing their concentration under pressure. I guess they failed that test.
- There was a tradition of keepers at Anfield to play as a sweeper, going back to Tommy Lawrence under Bill Shankly.
- If you can stay alive and enjoy life, that's the whole heart and soul of life. That's why I played with a smile on my face all these years.
