- People can't do miracles and are not responsible to do miracles, but people can pick up miracles from God and hand it to another person - a miracle happens when that occurs.
- If you want your dream more than you have to have people's affirmation, that's how you break through your border bullies.
- It's when you begin to think about going to your dream that your dream is always outside of your comfort zone. It's always beyond what you've ever done.
- The journey toward your Big Dream changes you. In fact, the journey itself is what prepares you to succeed at what you were born to do.
- When you teach, you need to give the students incentives by grades or by other factors. I went to the Bible to find that topic in Scripture. I was shocked that after college and graduate school I had no idea that Jesus Christ had talked so much about rewards.
- I went to Africa without the perspective of a balance between teaching people the truth, which has been my calling, and helping people who have physical problems, like AIDS and orphans and hunger.
- You do have a Dream. It's part of what it means to be human, created in the image of God.
- Africa has lost its dream, and when people don't have a dream and don't pursue it, they flounder. People are shocked that I would move to Africa. But I say the place of greatest need is the place of greatest opportunity.
- There is an economy in Heaven. There are cities in Heaven, and there are people who lead and people who don't lead, people who are rewarded and people who are not rewarded.
- Most people think that Heaven is a choir, and all you will do is sing.
- It's so easy to get caught up in the demands of life. And we all take refuge at times in routines and recliners and 'usual' anything!
- To truly repent of a big thing, you have to go into it with your heart open and force yourself to deal with it at that level and to apologize to God.
- Not everybody is going to agree with your dream. I'm sure you've had border bullies in your life as you moved into your career. And what we don't want to do is focus upon them.
- Most of us don't think about miracles that we could possibly do. We don't have a vocabulary of how God works with the specific things that He does, and we don't know how to align ourselves with what He is doing so that we can be His vehicle on the earth to deliver a miracle.
- Repentance means you change your mind so deeply that it changes you.
- When a person partners with God in delivering a miracle to another person, they have done what they were supposed to do; God can then deliver the miracle to the other person.
- Everyone has a dream deep in their heart, which is a center of what they want to do. If they had all the money, and they had the time and they were guaranteed that they'd be successful, that dream is what they would love to do.
- The truth is, even those who think Dreams only happen to someone else carry a Dream hidden deep in their heart, just hoping it can come true.
