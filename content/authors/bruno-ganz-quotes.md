- I'm not someone who could do 'Superweib,' even if you tell me that this director is another Lubitsch. I saw the preview, and I have to say that you'd need a squad of police officers to force me to see the whole thing.
- I was so stupid when I was young. I thought that everyone should share my feelings and my sadness about the state of the world, the stuff you have when you are 16 and are asking if God exists.
- I really do not like violence.
- I do not want to repeat myself with my roles.
- Every actor wants to win an Oscar.
- People really seemed to think of me as a guardian angel. People would bring their children before me for a blessing or something.
- I don't know what evil itself is.
- I tend to identify with my roles to such an extent that I appear to be totally convinced about certain statements that, in real life, I would never believe in.
- It would be nice to do one real Hollywood movie.
- I get bored with unintelligent scripts. When I read the first page and I can tell what is going to happen, I know I don't want to make the film. It's two months work and I would get deeply bored. I would even prefer to do something that didn't work at the box-office, so long as it kept my interest alive.
- As a boy I was morbidly shy.
- I like to walk. I like to read. I like to watch people.
- I was a leftist for a long time.
- An Australian actor wouldn't have the experience to feel how it is to be in Australia as a European.
- When I was still young and living in Switzerland, I had auditioned in Munich for a German film and was rejected. So I gave up and concentrated on my stage work. But I always wanted to make films.
- I am not considered to be extroverted - except on the stage.
- I'm very curious.
- People in planes said: 'Ah, no need to be afraid, because with you here, nothing can happen. Now we are safe.' Or a mother said to her child: 'Look, there's your guardian angel.' They weren't joking. That was an amazing feeling. I loved that. Because that means much more than people saying, 'You are a very good actor,' or 'I love your work.'
- Kinski was fascinating. To me he was always very nice and he never attacked me. He liked to show his power by sometimes quarrelling with people on production. I adored him as an actor, but not always as a person.
- In some way I became an angel, and who except me has experienced that in his lifetime?
