- The basic drive behind real philosophy is curiosity about the world, not interest in the writings of philosophers.
- Superstitions and belief in magic are perennial in just the same way as religion, and something near to being universal among mankind; and why this is so may be interesting, but in most cases the beliefs themselves are devoid of interesting content, at least to me.
