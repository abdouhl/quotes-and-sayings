- I know I can play with the best of them. I can be one of the best in the world at one point in time.
- Most people think that I'm so technical that I don't have a feel aspect or a rhythm aspect of it, but that's just the opposite. I need to get into my momentum and my rhythm in regards to being technical and analytical, and also being that artist.
- Anything that helps shoot lower scores or makes golf more fun and grows the game, that's what I'm all about.

- The time to hurry is in between shots. It's not over the shot. It's timing how people walk. You have to add that to the equation. If you've got somebody walking slow and they get up to the shot and take their 20 seconds, what's the aggregate time for them to hit that shot in between shots? That's what really matters. It's not the shot at hand.

- There's a bunch of different ways to play the game of golf. You don't need to play it one way. It doesn't need to be one swing that's perfect out there.

- As a kid, I liked building a lot of Legos and built houses and did some fun stuff with that.
- On short courses I can still play good, even with my added length.
- I just kept going to the gym, and luckily I have a gym at home, so I just go in there probably for 30 minutes and then I go back out and then I go back in for another 30 minutes and accumulated like about three-and-a-half hours of working out a day. It was a lot. It was ridiculous. But I said I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it right.
- I have to chase down the most scientifically efficient way to get the golf ball in the hole.
- For some people to say, 'I just go up there and hit it,' we'll that's good for you. If it works for you, it works for you. But I want to be as precise as possible heading into that shot.
- In the mornings, I usually have four eggs, five pieces of bacon, some toast, and two protein shakes.

- Throughout the course of the day, I'll have a GoMacro bar here and there, I'll have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, I'll have another protein drink, I'll have at least two protein drinks on the golf course, at every six holes, and then after the round I'll have one.
- When I got a stronger core, my hands weren't able to keep up. They weren't able to tolerate the force my core was generating.
- I can't tell you how many times I had opportunities to do other things and went and golfed because I wanted to be the best.
- I player my lower-lofted irons slightly higher-up in my stance. Not as much as variable-length, but a little further up can help golfers adapt to the lower-lofted irons.

- What's funny about me is that when I try and relax, and my body is in a fatigued or - you know, my muscles aren't feeling that great, I feel I only get worse. But when I go work out and do the things that are productive to helping off-set the weak muscles or hurt muscles, I feel like I can become a lot better after that.
- Every tournament that I go to, I'll prepare my absolute best to play my best golf. And if my best golf is a Top-10, then so be it.
- That's my whole goal for the game of golf - it's not only to make myself a better player, but to have people have a more enjoyable experience when I'm around.
- I always look at the worst situations and try and figure out how I can make them better. Let today's garbage be better than yesterday's, is my motto.
- If you had a robot out here calculating all the variables, I think you could potentially get really close to perfection, but from a human perspective, there's no way to understand all the wind. The wind is the biggest variable, and the grass length is the second biggest variable that we just don't have control over and never will.
- People call me slow. I call myself quick with the stuff I do.
- I was always a guy that would study for three hours and barely get an A on the test and you would have another guy next to me who would study for maybe 30 minutes and ace it.

- I used to wake up every single morning feeling terrible because my abs weren't working properly, and my back would hurt because it was overcompensating for them. So once I started training the body proportionally, it really showed me a new life.
- I don't play golf for money. I play golf to execute that shot, the beautiful shot that everybody adores. That's why I think we all play golf.
- I'm all about penalizing. I've got no issue with penalizing people who are taking over their allotted time.
- I think it's unfortunate because people don't see what I do day-in and day-out, high-fiving the kids, saying thank you to the fans and volunteers out there, and they just look at all the negative stuff.
- Growing up, I was the odd bird. My interest in mathematics, my interest in the world, how I approach things from a scientific standpoint. You're always going to be looked at as a different bird.
- Golf is my passion and livelihood.
- You'll find that one-length irons are far more versatile around the greens. You can vary the trajectory more, your distance control will improve because you can choke down more if you want.
- It's literally I'll be injured or hurt in some facet and I'll go work out to heal it, to make it get better so I can hold that tolerance level.

- I'm a total nonconformist; for me, it's about going down rabbit holes.

- I use a system called Vector Green Reading, which applies science to the green reads.
- I'd definitely use a 48-inch driver if I could control it.
- Australia is a great place. It's my second favorite country, other than the U.S., obviously.
- When people start talking to me about slow play and how I'm killing the game, I'm doing this and that to the game, that is complete and utter you-know-what.
- I want to be the number one player in the world, right? But at the end of the day you have to go through each individual step and be able to execute each individual step to be able to get to that goal.
- I'm not worried about the Masters. I never worry about this tournament or that tournament.
- I've tried the keto diet and all these things, but what I've found is that as long as I'm keeping a 2:1 ratio of carbs to protein, that works for me.
