- I definitely feel like I'm carrying on the legacy of the Scott family. What Wendell had to go through was extremely difficult, but he kept racing, kept fighting. Part of him will be with me when I'm out on the track.

- There's no need for me to go out there and try to set the world on fire, try to win races and put myself in a tough spot, not be able to capitalize on it. If the opportunity presents itself, yeah, we'll jump on it. There's no need for me to force a hole, end up tearing up a racecar.

- I shoot with a Canon 5D Mark III.
- From what I've learned I need to do, is let everything else go and focus on finishing the race and having fun.
- NASCAR - everybody thinks redneck, Confederate flags, racists. And I hate it. I hate it because I know NASCAR is so much more.
- You know, it helps having an African American driver behind the wheel. I'm representing that culture and that background. But a lot of background pressure, I don't really put that on me. I know I have enough pressure to go out and perform every week.

- I feel for everybody that goes through it because depression is real, and it doesn't take much to put you in that state of mind to where you think everybody's against you, you're up against the world and that's not true.
- This is a dream come true to race for 'The King' Richard Petty Motorsports, the iconic No. 43 and for all the fans and partners that have and continue to support this team.

- I'll never be intimidated by somebody, and I will treat you will respect as long as I'm treated with respect.
- I've never had any issues with racism or racist people at the track for as long as I've been racing in NASCAR. All of that stuff that has happened to my face took place when I was coming up.

- It's short-track racing. You're going to get that and it's going to happen. I don't know why everybody thought it was the end of the world when wrecks were going to happen. Like I said, with close-quarter racing like that it's going to get heated.

- I try to represent myself and my team the best that I can.

- Once we got to the race track, everybody called me Bubba - we created a brand around it. Now it's become a household name.
- When you sign up to become something, you're signing up to become something larger than yourself. Represent something more than yourself.
- The Ahmaud Arbery video was the final straw for me in being silent. That shook me to the core like nothing has in the past. Something flipped inside of me to be more vocal and stand up for racial equality and make sure we get a hold on that and change the face of this world and get it to a better place.
- I enjoy watching those reality shows.
- I'm just a race car driver.

- Once we started racing, my dad had his own industrial cleaning business about twenty minutes from the house, so we kept our race cars there.
- From Richard Petty to Andy Murstein, everybody at RPM is standing behind me and believing in me on track and also following me through this journey off track and letting me find my way and find my voice in standing up for what's right.
- No one should feel uncomfortable when they come to a NASCAR race, so it starts with Confederate flags. Get them out of here. They have no place for them.
- We are ambassadors. We are leaders of our own brands, and then in life things are thrown at you, you have to stand up for what's right. That brings on a whole new role. It's not on the front of the agenda that you see, but if you read the fine print it's part of becoming an athlete and the pedestal you get with that.
- My mother said, 'Did you ever believe you would be an activist?' I said, 'No, not really.' But I just felt in my heart that I needed to step up and be a leader in the forefront.
- I just kind of go by the theory of, 'Don't knock it until you try it.'
- I've already got 10,000 more eyes on me because I am of color and they're going to see what I can do in the top series. That's enough pressure in itself, so I don't need to add extra pressure.
- I'm African-American. There are more eyes on me than anybody. They're going to take the negative before the positive.

- I do laundry, but my bags from the last race will sit there until the very last minute that I have to do laundry again.
- I've stood for the national anthem ever since grade school. It's a patriotic thing for me. I understand what Colin Kaepernick and others are doing, but it's not for me.
- It's simple-minded people like that, the ones that are afraid of change, they use everything in their power to defend what they stand up for instead of trying to listen and understand what's going on.
- We have that platform to tell something and that voice to tell people we have got to stop and change our ways. That's just how I think about it.
- I chase checkered flags.
- I've always been a person that has said what's on my mind and stand behind it with a lot of heart and passion.
- Systemic racism is a problem from every aspect of life.
- I'll go out there and prove to everybody that I belong to the Cup Series.
- Ever since being vocal in being a human being, I've been proud to kind of step away from Bubba Wallace the athlete and to step up as Bubba Wallace the human and not be so, 'I don't know If I can touch that;' 'I don't know if I can say these types of things.' I'm letting that guard down.
- I was so young when I started that I didn't really understand all of it. We'd show up and have the slurs being thrown out there, but my parents always dealt with that. They just told me to go out there, do my best, and try to win. Go out there and race well and they'll shut right up.
- Our sport has always had somewhat of a racist label to it.
- Times get tough sometimes, you lose cool. At the end of the day it is one of the most demanding and grueling sports.
- People are entitled to their own opinion to make them feel good, to make them sleep at night.
- The biggest thing is getting the kid in a kart - they have to buy it and that's the biggest thing. You can go to a sporting store and buy a basketball for 30 bucks or a football for 30 bucks. You go buy a go-kart and that's 300 bucks. What are you going to get? A basketball or a go-kart?
- It's actually one of the only things that I do that I don't get frustrated over. Everything else I do - racing, golf, video games - those things I want to win at. With photography, I think the camera wins every time.
- This is a team sport.
- I've seen too many comments, too many stories from a fan, or first-time fans that have come to a race in years past and the first thing they say is, 'I seen the Confederate flag flying, it made me feel uncomfortable.'
- We've all got to make sure we're all pulling in the same direction. That's what's going to keep us ahead of the ball. As soon as we start getting in the opposite direction, that's when we start getting behind, and the results will start to show.
- My mom told me, every weekend, always stay positive no matter what the circumstances. Stuff's gonna go down. It's not gonna be your race. Media is gonna take the bad before the good.
