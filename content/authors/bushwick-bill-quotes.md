- A lot of people don't want to vote because they believe the negatives rather than the positives about the outcome of their decisions about the sheriff or councilman or the board of education in their community.
- My music is being condemned strictly for publicity and votes.
- I really like Kendrick Lamar. I'm still a Talib Kweli fan, Lupe Fiasco, Mos Def, Common Sense - people who say things that are relevant to everyday life. I don't pay attention to artists that talk about throwing money away and the car that they drive.

- We all share the planet, the rainbows share the sky, why can't we all share the same dream? And rap about what we see?
- I've never got the vibe that they would do a gospel song. 'Cause when they talking about doing another Geto Boys album I said I would do it if I could rap like I'm rapping on my gospel album, I didn't get a whole lot of cosigning on that from all the political parties concerned.

- I understand witchcraft being from the islands. You can't be from the Caribbeans and say that you don't know voodoo or don't know about it. Or that you don't know someone who has practiced it. It's just that in my family we never did. People in extreme impoverished situations if they ain't reaching out to God, they reaching out to the other side.
