- There is no other way of writing a novel than to begin at the beginning at to continue to the end.
- There is still need to think and plan, but on a different scale, and along different lines.
- They managed to find time... to tell me that there was no chance of my being accepted for service and that really I should be surprised to still be alive.
- Novel writing is far and away the most exhausting work I know.
