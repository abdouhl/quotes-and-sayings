- I think everyone that creates has to cope with the fact that people actually don't give you money because they like you, but because they get something out of it.
- Production-wise, I've always stuck with Ableton Live and there's really no reason to switch to something else at this point.
- When dubstep was big, Ubisoft told the composer for 'Far Cry 3' to make dubstep and to me that was really weird.
- Minecraft has a terrible sound engine. Imagine a looping sound file that plays for two seconds and then just starts over.
- There's this weird game called 'Blueberry Garden.' For that game an artist recorded some piano music, but evidently he only had a really terrible microphone on top of the piano, and I really liked it and wanted to experiment with that. So, I made piano recording and really mangled it, and kept experimenting with the technique.
- With 'Minecraft,' I've started creating serene ambiance music. As the game went on to become famous, people started identifying me as the ambient music person, which I never actually thought I was.
- My music is not worth $2.5bn. And also, I'm not rich.
- I didn't pretend that I was good at writing music, so I wrote terrible music, intentionally. As time went on, the terrible subsided, and I started getting good.
- This new project, 'Excursions,' has been a trip down my own memory lane before 'Minecraft,' when I aspired to create music I could hear on a commute to dance to.
- I want to make sound effects for biomes. If you're walking along a river you hear the water, then in the forest you hear birds, but as night comes in, it becomes kind of weird, you can walk through a desert, a swamp, and the sounds merge and change with you.
- I started out being quite an eclectic composer, not quite sure where to fit in. I tried my hand a bit at everything, except perhaps music with lyrics.
- I was worried Microsoft would take my music. But ultimately I talked to the lawyers and I still own it.
- Being the composer of 'Minecraft' is basically like imagining the distance between earth and moon.
- Mojang doesn't want to just have work relationships, they want social relationships between friends.
- The first time I saw 'Minecraft,' people wanted to have 8-bit style video game music. But I wanted to go around that and make something organic and partly electronic, partly acoustic, and see if that would be interesting.
- All the big loud housey songs came from the idea of 'I want to create the same song over and over again.' Except that I've created each one in a different location, or a different mindset.
- I'm a lousy writer, and it shows when I try to write poetry.
