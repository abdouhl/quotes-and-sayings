- I find myself in a position where I have a voice that has the potential to influence - I want to use that to inspire confidence in those that have yet to find it, to inspire compassion in those who don't understand, but most importantly, to inspire love in everyone through the experiences and stories that we can all relate to or empathize with.

- It takes a lot of emotional high and struggles to write songs.

- I have worked with a lot of people, all very different creatives, helping me hone my craft and discover myself as an artist and the record I want to make. It's such an amazing process seeing and hearing the tracks that people could eventually be listening to on my debut album!
- I'm very keen on making the world a better place, whether that's changing people's attitudes or giving people the confidence to be who they are.

- My fans have been incredible since day one... Literally, the only reason I get to do what I do! I love every single one of them, and I am still being discovered by people! Just want to share what I do with everyone!
- There are a lot of songs about love and how it starts, whether that's realizing it yourself or coming to find it later on - but no sort of talk about the actual feelings that are created from love and passion.
- As a singer, you want to connect with as many people as possible; that's my whole thing.
