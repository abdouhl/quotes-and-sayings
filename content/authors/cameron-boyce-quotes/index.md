- As an actor, it's crucial you keep your ears open, especially when you're playing opposite comedic legends in almost every scene.
- I believe that if you put an energy out into the universe, you'll receive it back.
- I'm gonna be 20 in five months. I'm an adult, but I understand that there are nine-year-olds watching my every move, so I try, at least in a public, to be as good of a role model as I can.
- At the end of the day I'll be able to keep everything that I really loved about my time with Disney. The friendships won't be lost, nor will the free tickets to Disneyland, so I really can't complain.
- Being African American and Jewish, I have plenty of ancestors and family members that I can look to for strength and, more importantly, for a grateful outlook on life.
- My tenure has been abnormally long for the average Disney kid - most only last three or four years.
- I have crazy friends, so a lot of times when we're out, people recognize me on the street, but they will yell, 'This is Cameron Boyce!' and just run! They do that. Then I'm in the middle of the street with people looking at me.
- I'll never forget during the 'Descendants' parade at Disneyland when I waved at a girl with bright blue hair and witnessed her dream being realized and the involuntary tears that followed.
- I will never wear a wig if I don't have to, but I will say that, honestly, it's not the greatest! They're hot and stick to your head.
- We always make so many excuses for ourselves - 'I'm so busy, I'm so tired, I don't want to do it.' You know? 'I'm passionate about it, but I'm not going to be the person that changes things.' Why do we tell ourselves that? We totally could. There are so many people who are making so much change just because they're passionate.
- Whether people agree or disagree with the decisions an actor makes after their Disney tenure, every alum has a clear vision of how they want their career to pan out.
- My mum is a total go-getter.
- The hardest thing about acting is all of the other things you have to think about besides performing... Your image, your team, networking - not to mention the mental strength you need to be able to stay unaffected by the rejection that every actor experiences.
- Changing someone else's life positively changes yours for the better as well.
- My mum literally drives into Skid Row every day and manages teams that are assembled to walk around and engage with usually chronically homeless people and try to get them into permanent housing.
- As I grow up, and knowing that the people who I'm reaching are so young, it for sure changes my perspective on how I want to be perceived.
- I definitely dish advice out more than I get it.
- I love voiceover work - I think it's fun.
- There's a long line of difference makers in my family. I'm following in the footsteps of some really strong men and women who have showed me what it means to give back; it's the greatest way to fulfill yourself.
- I've never been particularly religious, but I have recently acknowledged the universe and it's crazy powers, and that will probably fluctuate for the rest of my life.
- Many people have the heart to give back, but a lot don't know how to. I try to be the bridge for those people - whether that means getting them involved in one of my campaigns or inspiring them by showing them a blueprint of how to get others engaged.
- When you're excited about a project, sometimes it's hard to put a script down.
- To be able to be doing voiceover, and to be able to be doing 'Spider-Man,' it doesn't get much better than that.
- I've grown up on set, so I understand a lot of things that a new actor wouldn't, whether it's etiquette or how things work on a technical level.
- Kevin Hart. He's the man! I like his style. He's short, so I can relate. All the stories he tells are real. I respect that, and he's just a really funny dude - great comedy instincts. To do stand-up on a stage for an hour and tell stories and make people laugh is incredible.
- There is always something funny going on between scenes with Adam Sandler. He's always cracking jokes and yelling at people for no reason. It's pretty funny. He'll joke around during scenes, too. When he guest-starred on 'Jessie,' there was nothing in the script that he said first take.
- There's a lot of people in Hollywood who don't look like me or don't have similar features like me.
- I think every child actor has that moment where they're like, 'OK, I'm not the same person that I was, and you guys need to see me as something different.'
