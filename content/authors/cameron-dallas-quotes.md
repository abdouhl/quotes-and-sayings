- Nowadays, you can be a fan of someone that's not an actor or artist. You can be a fan of someone that makes YouTube videos.
- Never in a million years would I imagine Calvin Klein flying me out to my first men's fashion show.
- Calvin Klein is such an iconic brand in fashion, so I feel like working with them means you're definitely doing something right. They bring validation to someone, not only in the fashion community but in someone's career, which is why it was such an honor to work with them.

- YouTube, as longer form, the content you make there has to keep you entertained for three minutes - or five minutes.

- I have asked my mom and my sister a couple times if I should post something or not. Or if they think a video is funny.
- I had no idea what modeling entailed and what an agency was. It was crazy. As I continued to do it, it was fun for me to learn everything from A to Z.
- People get to choose who they follow, so they follow me for me. It's super humbling and awesome.
- I am really precise about who I want to work with and, no matter the timeline, I push to get what I think would be cool.
- I'm working on bridging the gap between mainstream famous and Internet famous. They're two different things, but eventually, social media will be the way to become a celebrity.
- A lot of followers would tell me, 'You've helped me through my depression or helped me stop cutting.' Something as easy as posting a video keeps them happy, or talking to them on Twitter helps them realize that what they're going through is temporary.
- X Out is perfect for my schedule. It is so simple, fast and actually works. I am more confident in my own skin and always camera ready - a necessity in my line of work.

It wasn't until I made my fourth crossover to a different platform that I went to Vine.

- If I made a mistake on a piece of content, I'm going to learn from it.
- I like to impress myself when I dress.
- I'm an entrepreneur.
- There's obviously a sense of responsibility that comes with having this following and having fans, and so there's a lot of stuff that I won't dare to post, just because I want to be a good influence.

- I don't really like to promote anything, but I will promote things I believe in and things that work.
- It's hard to sell a brand without having a face to it.
- When I got out of high school, I started breaking out. I tried everything from A to Z as far as seeing doctors and getting prescriptions. I even did home remedies, and I had no luck. A fan gave me Proactiv, and it cleared my skin, but there were too many steps. I lose everything, and I lost one of the products. My acne started to come back.
