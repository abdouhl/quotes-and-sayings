- I can't say this enough, I'm totally comfortable with my body. I like my body, I don't think it's a bad thing, I think I have a nice body, I'm happy with it.
- I eat a cheeseburger with French fries almost every day.
- I mean, I can get things done if I need to, but I can really be completely irresponsible and procrastinate until the very, very, very bitter end. In fact, sometimes I work better under pressure.
- I hate committing myself to anything. It's probably the lack of discipline, honestly. I'm probably a spoiled brat worried about getting my way every time.

- I can't wait to be that age and hanging out with a bunch of people hanging out all day playing golf and going to the beach, all my own age. We'd be laughing and having a good time and getting loopy on our prescription drugs. Driving golf carts around. I can't wait.

- Your regrets aren't what you did, but what you didn't do. So I take every opportunity.

- I haven't been worried about my image so much as I have been trying to find projects to push myself further than before.
- I love physical kinds of comedy and getting down and dirty and doing stunts. When I was growing up, I was always getting into fights with guys and usually punching out boys my age because I was a lot bigger and tougher. So I'm naturally accustomed to putting myself into the headspace of a girl who can take care of herself.

- I love older men.
- You don't want to be photographed? You don't want to be known? Then you don't need to be out there peddling movies.

- French fries. I love them. Some people are chocolate and sweets people. I love French fries. That and caviar.

- If you really want to torture me, sit me in a room strapped to a chair and put Mariah Carey's records on.
- I'm very happy with the way I look. I wake up some morning, catch myself in the bathroom mirror, and go, 'hey girl, you're alright'.

You can't take anything like that too seriously, otherwise you'd end up in the loony bin.

What started as a bit of fun, something to do other than be a model, has taken on a different career curve. I have been forced to ask where that curve is going to end up.
- I've always been a huge fan of Julia Roberts. Without her what would the world be like?

- I don't want to go to work and get into bed with someone else, not even Tom Cruise. It's not like I enjoy it.
- I think I've become more comfortable about being a human being.

- Acting is something different to everybody. I just know that if you watch an actor or actress getting better and better, I think that's them just understanding themselves better and better.
