- I rewatched 'The O.C.,' like, seven times!
- It's easy to think you have to fit some kind of mold.
- It was tragic every single time my mom told me we were moving. I would always envy my friends who had grown up in the same house their entire life, and they had markings on the wall of 'me at five years old' and all that. It made me so sad. I wished I'd had that.
