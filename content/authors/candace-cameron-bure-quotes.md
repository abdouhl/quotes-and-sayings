- My mom and dad - they were always there. They were always on the set. They focused on our family life. The entertainment business wasn't the end-all. They weren't out to get the next big paycheck or the next big movie. It was about 'What can we do as a family.'

- As a kid, I loved watching it. I used to watch with my sisters and my brothers. We watched WWE all the time.
- I will only do family-friendly films or television. They don't have to necessarily be Christian films, but I want to be in things that I'm comfortable having my children and husband watch. They come first in my life, not the film industry.
- When I see muscles that are more defined that I hadn't seen before, it's exciting. I love a muscular figure. It feels like an accomplishment, and it makes me feel strong, and I love having a strong body.

- I'm a mom, so I have to be comfortable. Jeans are a staple - I have way too many in my closet! It's warm in Florida, so I wear jeans and a tank top every day. I love my True Religions, my Rich and Skinny, and Citizens of Humanity. But I also love getting dressed up!
