- If you are born black, and you don't accept your natural status as a victim, then the validity of your blackness is immediately called into question.
- I realized that liberals were actually the racists. Liberals were actually the trolls.
- You can't speak as a conservative on campus without being boycott, without being protested, without students lining up and playing music loudly so that they can drown out the sound of your voices.
- I went to school at the University of Rhode Island and pursued a degree in journalism, which is a little bit ironic.
- I'm not a politician, I'm not in Congress. You know what I mean? I'm just a black girl that makes YouTube videos and tries to teach dialogue in campuses so they think before stepping into a voting booth.
- Fascists, Antifa attacked me, and an all-black police force in Philadelphia, and they claim to be fighting racism.
- You can be poor, middle class, or rich - it doesn't matter. The black card will still confer upon you an entire history of oppression, even if you've never been oppressed. Flash the black card, and most white people will cower.
- Play the black card expertly, and you can win awards, make millions - all the while claiming that the people who got you there somehow hate you.
- I grew up in a household listening to hip-hop music.
- The reason that we're seeing so many people flee the Left - I like to call them liberal refugees, like myself - is because they do not allow you to think freely. If you agree with them 95 percent and disagree on 5 percent, you are essentially excommunicated. You're not allowed to be a liberal anymore. You're not allowed to be a Democrat anymore.
- I learned conservatism through my grandfather; I didn't know that was the name. I didn't know these were conservative principles. Starting his life on a sharecropping farm. Working tremendously hard. Five years old, picking cotton and laying tobacco out to dry on a farm, and today he now owns that farm.
- I don't know why people like being oppressed.
- The polls told us that Hillary Clinton was going to win, and she didn't. I wasn't fooled by the polls.
- There is going to be a major black exit from the Democrat Party, and they are going to actually have to actually compete for their votes in 2020.
- If you look at things historically, Kanye West has really represented the battering ram against political correctness.
- I was a first-generation college student. This was supposed to be the ticket to prosperity. But it wasn't. I left college with a mountain of debt and no practical skills.
- I actually remember being in 3rd grade and piecing together in my head that one of my guy friends was homosexual.
- Call me weird, but personally, when it comes to my ovaries, I prefer to speak to my gynecologist. I don't think the leaders of the free world should have to be an expert on the issue, nor should they ever publicly voice their opinions.
- My take, after spending some time with him, is that Kanye West is not a conservative. He's not a Republican, but he is a free thinker, and he's an independent thinker.
- The black community is broken up in general.
- Racism exists, but it is far less rampant than ignorance, and ignorance can be cured through experience.
- You can still say whatever you want to say on social media, but you have to be willing to stand by your words.
- I didn't vote, exactly. This is the first time I've been politically inclined and active, and I think Donald Trump is a tremendous president. And I wanted to be educated. I wanted to do a deep dive before I started going out there and saying stuff as opposed to other people who mindlessly vote.
- Long before Donald Trump came down the escalator, Kanye West was public enemy No. 1 for simply trying to tell the truth to people about things that were going on, so I'm unsurprised that he supports me and my ideas and me just thinking freely.
- For so long, black conservatives have not been able to have a voice; people who have bi-racial children, people in bi-racial relationships, it has been so black and white. I blame Obama. His eight years in office did a lot of damage in terms of race relations in this country.
- We say it all the time: the leftist media is inciting violence and hate by calling everybody a racist and a white supremacist.
- The liberal people are the violent people in this country. The Democrat Party are the violent people.
- I like to say now that the reason I'm conservative is because I used to be a liberal, and I learned a lot.
- I can't think of the last Asian that I ran into that talked about internment camps. But black people always want to talk to me about slavery.
- That was the moment I wanted to use bitcoin: when I saw Harriet Tubman on a $20 bill. It's like, when you see all the slave movies, it's like, why you gotta keep reminding us about slavery? Why don't you put Michael Jordan on a $20 bill?
- I don't come from a family that had the money to put me through college, so I left school with $100,000 in student loan debt.
- Liberals believe that they own blacks - still. They believe they're something proprietary about being black in this country, and if you deviate from the way they want you to think, in the way they want you to act, they grow violent.
- I always say I was a liberal, but I wasn't active in politics. I just assumed I was a liberal because I was black and I was a woman. And I know now that sounds really foolish, but I had different priorities.
