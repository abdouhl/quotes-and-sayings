- I'm not a celebrity trainer. I don't have my own line of DVDs, but I'm a fighter and have everything to prove.
- Even though I had been boxing, I had no idea I could beat somebody in the ring. And I had no idea I could really take a punch. When I realized that, I really started taking off.
- Everyone has a different training style and being a female, sometimes you find you have to get really aggressive. Some people respond really well to aggression, some people don't.
- I don't care who you are or what you have gone through - everyone has something they are fighting for.
- Nothing would make me happier than to train the next winner on 'The Biggest Loser' because it means the world to me. Everybody has a fighter inside them, they just don't realize it.
- I'm constantly feeding my metabolism. But at the same time if I want to go one night and have a nice dinner then I won't sweat it the next day.
- I know that when I get stressed, I want to eat junk food. So now I just know - 'I'm stressed, I want to eat junk food, so I'm going to go work out instead, or eat something healthy.' It really works.
- I like to eat chocolate and pizza - that's my vice! - just like everyone else, but if I do it I have to keep it under control.
- I'm the type of person who can get a feel for what you need and what I need to do to push you to get you to a breaking point, where you realize that you can't go on this way anymore, that the reason you're heavy is because you're ignoring all the stuff that's going on inside.
- My background is that of a competitive athlete and a fighter, and I'm bringing something totally different to 'The Biggest Loser' that wasn't there before.
- It's not just the physical aspect of boxing, it's the whole fighter mentality that has been ingrained in me through the years as a competitive athlete. One of the hardest things you'll ever do is to box - to get into the ring and to face off with somebody whose whole goal is to knock you out, to hurt you, and to be able to fight back.
