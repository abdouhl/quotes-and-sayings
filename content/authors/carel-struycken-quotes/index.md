- I never wanted to be an actor. It was just something that happened.
- I actually enjoy playing monsters and that kind of thing.
- Star Trek' always had a pretty serious atmosphere, but with 'Twin Peaks,' you walked onto the set and you had the feeling that everybody was walking around in a trance.
- I was just picked from the streets to do some acting, and that's how I got started.
- I get to play a lot of butler-chauffeurs.
- The wonderful thing about 'Star Trek' is that they're very open to suggestions for scripts and story ideas from the viewers. That's really unique.
- I think everybody is intimidated by Jack Nicholson. But he was really nice to work with.
- Our culture is so inundated with Freudian prototypes, and I think that 'Twin Peaks' came up with a whole new Pandora's Box of outlandishly mental, out of balance people that have never been described or have been noted by the psychiatric community.
- I even got invited to a 'Star Trek' sea cruise. That was pretty exciting.
- Even before the movie was made, people already thought I was the original Lurch.
- Many times, people would react to the fact that I looked different, and I would think that there was something wrong with me - that maybe one of my shirt buttons was undone or something. It took 20 or 30 years to get used to it.
