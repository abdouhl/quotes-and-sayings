- Joe Gallager's like a petulant child sometimes. In press conferences, for instance, when we're talking, he's rolling his eyes like a schoolgirl, pretending he's not listening. It's disrespectful and I don't like that.
- It's Northern Ireland, it's Ireland, it's Scotland, it's Wales, there's Scousers, Londoners, all behind me.

- I was always quiet and even timid.
- I remember going through checkpoints as a kid. It felt normal but, looking back, of course it created tension. People standing with guns, sometimes your car getting searched and being asked where you are going. It changes the atmosphere.
