- It's questionable whether I believe in God or Jesus but I do believe in a spiritual world and some kind of afterlife.
- I don't think there is anything more proud or glorious than standing in the arena as a fighter - that you've done it in on your own. That's why I love fighting.
- I look back at the first Groves fight, and it was all so bad, so wrong. Everyone was telling me it was going to be easy, the bookies, everyone. Like an unprofessional fool, like an idiot, I listened to them. I didn't give myself the best possible chance.
- There's something weird about me the way even the biggest punches to the jaw don't wobble me, but if you can avoid being hit too often, so much the better.
- Andre Ward beat me fair and square on points in a boring fight, a dull affair. Same as when he beat Kessler. Headbutted him to bits, but he knows how to win. He wins ugly, but he knows how to win.

- You are either genetically tough or you're not.
- Many top professional sportsmen from different sports see a psychologist.
- I was 5ft 3in tall until I was 17. Then I suddenly shot up.
- I don't actually think boxing is a particularly dangerous sport, I wouldn't even put it in the top ten of dangerous sports, but that's only if you take it seriously. Whenever I stepped into the ring I was well hydrated, I was at the right weight and I was prepared. It wasn't a dangerous sport for me.
- A three-month training camp writes you off, I wake up and I literally can't get out of bed.

- I believe my grandma is watching over me and I draw strength from that.
- It's not too late actually to speak to somebody about psychology, it's never too late.
- I haven't had the recognition I deserve. You can go back to anybody's career - Ricky Hatton, Joe Calzaghe, David Haye, Amir Khan, Chris Eubank, Nigel Benn, Steve Collins, Naseem Hamed. My record is better than all of theirs. I've won against more unbeaten fighters than any of them, had more exciting fights.
- I don't want to be the country's best-kept boxing secret. I want to cross over from being a boxer on the back pages to the front pages and become the big superstar I deserve to be.
- Boxing's a bit like the Army, nine out of 10 people come out as pretty nice people. It taught me self-worth, to respect my elders and what the right thing was to do. As a result, I don't think I even got a single detention at school. It helped me to be good.
- Boxing is not like any other sport, you have to weigh up the risk and reward. Things like playing football, tennis, you might be three sets to love down, but boxing you're going to the hospital on a stretcher and you know potentially you are going to get an injury you can't walk away from.
- You manage your injuries if you're serious about fighting.
- I've won titles at home, I've won them abroad, I've defended titles abroad and lost them, and gone on to dominate my next opponent to win them back.
- I can say, 'right, I will stop this kid in round five.' If I am good enough to do that then fair enough. I don't gamble but my brothers and my friends, they did quite well off it.
- I don't feel any remorse or guilt after a fight. I can sympathise with an opponent who is getting a beating, but if it is the choice between him and me, it's not gonna be me.
- You can improve your punching power, but only to an extent. If you can punch hard, then it's just god-given, that's just nature, not nurture and there's not much you can do to develop punching power.
- I always give Calzaghe credit. He was a great fighter, really tough, unbeaten in 46 fights. He's never, ever given me any props at all. And for that I'd love to punch him in the face really hard.
- The fans want to see a conclusive finish. It's quite a brutal, barbaric sport and the people who watch it want to see someone out. That's what I do for a living.
- As tired as I am, I can always go another round, and I feel the other guy can't.
- I don't look at my opponent's eyes in the ring. I watch his gloves so that I can block or avoid his punches.
- There have been many boxing comebacks over the years, and sadly many of them do not have a happy ending.
- You are never going to top boxing at Wembley stadium.
- I've had a Japanese judge, a Mexican judge in the past, and they have done some ridiculous scoring.
- I say that I'm genetically gifted. In a weight-governed sport, I don't put weight on because of my Polish 'heritage, it's genetic. Even when I am not in training, I don't put on weight. When I start training, I don't need to take a lot of weight off.
- The only thing I miss is the actual fight night and the feeling of winning. I can say this with my hand on my heart, there is no greater feeling than standing victorious in the ring or in the case of my last fight, a stadium.
- I would have loved to have fought 15-rounders, because I always come on strong at the end.
- There is an age limit of 35 on amateur boxing. They should consider putting an age limit on professional boxing.
- I've had an operation on my knee, two operations on my hand, injuries on elbows and stuff but you get through it.
- When someone like Richard Branson goes up there and starts doing chartered flights... and you can look back on Earth and see the Earth's curvature, I'll believe the Earth is a globe.
- People can look at my style and my faults, point out all the things I didn't do as well as other fighters but I was never knocked out or stopped.
- No sport is more geared to the warrior's code of honour, pride and respect. That's why I love boxing. It's mano a mano. One against one. It's driven by fear and your need to conquer it.
- I'm not in this for superstardom. I do it purely for the love of the sport. I just love fighting.
- Golovkin cannot win a fight against me, he's not big enough.
- I'm involved in fight of the year nearly every time I fight because I put it all on the line. I don't look to keep out of the way and nick a decision.
- I don't tell lies. I don't need to.
- You don't want to be going into any fight thinking you've got to get a knockout, or force a stoppage, because it takes you out of your gameplan.
- I've been through the highs and lows. I know what it's like to taste defeat and it's not nice.
- Audley Harrison is quite a soft, gentle guy. He gives it all the talk but, when he's in the ring, you can see he's scared to death.
- If Jermain Taylor was a bit fitter and he had a bit more steam in the tank towards the end, he might have survived and won on points, but he didn't have any energy left in the tank, because I sapped it out of him. I absolutely punched holes in him for the last three rounds.
- Closer to a fight, I can really feel my heartbeat in my chest. I can hear it beat through my mouth, this 'gunk, gunk, gunk' rhythm.
- I've been in the ring. I've fought in a title fight. I know what it is like to lose a fight. I know everything a fighter has been through.
- My mum and dad split up when I was five years old, and that was quite upsetting. But ever since then, I've been very hard.
- People have been upset in the past about pay-per-view fights because they got sold a lie or an illusion that was not real.
- I had a lot of rematches in the amateurs. You don't always know what an opponent's going to do. I do find that I beat them more easily second time around.
- It's not ideal; I don't want to get a bad decision. If I win the fight, I expect to get my hand raised at the end of it. But, if people see it's a bad decision, it gets sorted out. You get another shot, or you fight someone else at the top level.
- Your body releases a natural endorphin when you're fighting. You don't feel pain.
- Boxing is a hurt game if you can't be at your best, can't be 100 per cent mentally and physically switched on to performing, to win titles, defend titles, defend yourself in the correct fashion, then I don't think you should fight.
- Sparring is not as tough as a fight.
- I've even fought with a broken hand, against Brian Magee.
- I boxed till my late 30s, so 47, that's impossible really to be at your best and if you aren't at your best you shouldn't be boxing.
- I watched Sly Stallone and the 'Rocky' movies over and over again. They were fantastic.
- I know what it's like to fight against the crowd from when I went to Denmark to fight Mikkel Kessler. He's like David Beckham over there, he gets blanket coverage in the papers all week, and you could hear a pin drop when I was landing my shots. There was no respect for The Cobra out there. There was no noise, no love, nothing.
- The only person in the world who could knock me out is my anaesthetist.
- There's weaknesses in every fighter.
- I don't need to do that many weights but every now and then I do the bar, with 25-30 kilos on either side, which amounts to roughly probably my body weight. I lift this up above my head, then drop it and lift it up again.
- Make no mistake, the days and hours before going into the ring can be stressful for any boxer. The bigger and tougher the fight the greater stress, But if a boxer knows he's stepping out of his league it's even worse.
- I don't think I'll be fighting when I'm 40.
- I'll never be able to replace the feeling of standing victorious in the ring, that's never going to happen again and I'm never going to fight again.

- I don't hype a fight to sell tickets.
- I did it the hard way, I fought everyone I could and I would not have it any other way.
- The general public don't like boxers. They prefer tennis players.
- When I say I am going to win a world title, I mean it; when I say I'll fight the best, I mean it; I say I'll fight Joe Calzaghe because I wanted to. When he vacated, I lost sleep over that. It had nothing to do with money or the belt. He was renowned as the best super-middleweight in the world and that is what I want to be.
- Your fitness is your ability to recover and you can't recover when you're old.
- I've been in the ring with big-muscled heavyweights and cruiserweights, who couldn't punch the skin off a rice pudding, and then I've taken on light welterweights and light middleweights, and they hit hard, and you can see they're not trying.
- I've always been into sport, I watch all sport - I love golf, tennis, football and to me to box and have people in the arena cheering me on, I'll always miss that.
- A fool can never be made to question his own wisdom. And George Groves is very foolish. He believes his own nonsense. He cannot stay with me for 12 rounds. He's not tough enough.
- I don't talk for the sake of talking and I don't talk with a forked tongue.
- I'm quite a ruthless, cold-hearted bastard. I always have been.
- I always like to get that finishing blow and satisfy the crowd.
- You can't talk about Golovkin in the same breath as me. If he thinks he can beat me, he's not from planet Earth.
- When I won the title against Jean Pascal it also won me fight of the year.
- I won four world titles, got beat twice - but avenged one of those losses - and the other loss was on points to someone who was unbeaten in Andre Ward. I had a comfortable, successful career and it wasn't through natural ability but through dedication and hard work.
- I'd love to box in Las Vegas - it's the fight capital in the world.
- Apparently, we've been to the moon in 1969, 1970. We've been there six times, I don't believe a word of it. Some people do.
- I never cheated on nutrition, I always had a really good diet and I always supplemented well - that's a massive factor in any sport. Even in everyday life, if people are just going to the gym recreationally, they'll have targets in mind and if you're not supplementing correctly or concentrating on your diet, you're wasting your time.
- I absolutely love boxing. I live and breathe it.
- It might sound strange now from where I'm standing as a world boxing champion, but I harboured serious thoughts, at the age of nine, of putting my whole life into snooker. I remember being fascinated by the game, watching the likes of Steve Davis, and thought I would do it.
- I'm a winner.
- I wear my heart on my sleeve and tell you how it is.
- Some fighters had blinding speed and reflexes in their heyday but faded badly with age.
- Sometimes big boxing matches should take place on the cobbles. That's really where Mikkel Kessler and me ought to have sorted it out.
- The Golovkin thing came up and I said 'fight me at 172lbs and I'll think about it' and he wanted me to go down to 166. He wouldn't even come up to super-middle and I was already retired by that point.
- I've kept improving in many ways. Boxers evolve with experience.
- I'm a fighter.
- What I will say though is that I've got quite a big back, from doing pull-ups, and that will make your punches more solid. But in terms of the hardness of your punch, it's about timing and speed.
- Gennady Golovkin is a small middleweight, I'm a big super-middleweight. The fight was maybe talked about a year after I retired and it was never going to happen.
- If Mikkel Kessler thinks I'm going soft just because I'm a dad then he's the one who's gone soft in the head.
