- I'm not a mimic.
- I never consider what I do as work. It has been fun. It's been rewarding and very fulfilling.
- I fantasized doing something like 'Wait, Wait.'
- I look out the window in the morning sometimes, and the sun is rising, and the people are going to work. I look at Washington as being that big, sleeping giant, just stretching and waking up, and going about its business. And to know that I'm working in the capital of the most powerful nation in the world - I feel good about that.
- My favorite time at NPR has been 'Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!' It was loads of fun and gave me a chance to meet and talk in person to the audiences that I felt I had known for so many years on the air.
- Before I even started to school, I sometimes would hide behind the radio, which would be sitting on a table, and pretend that I was on the air and try to fool people who came by to listen.
- I can honestly say I am the luckiest man around to be able to have worked at a job I love for so many years. It's truly been a joy for me.
- I take a nap in the afternoons, and I'm in bed at 9 P.M. It's a struggle sometimes.
- I've slept through a mild earthquake in Italy. And also a very tight hockey game where people were screaming their heads off.
- I try to be romantic.
- My parents were not professionals. They were products of the Depression.
- I love my work. It's been good to me.
- 'Wait, Wait' has been great. The humor is there, and we get to do a lot of action.
- I'm not interested myself in personality news.
- If not for radio, I'd probably be working at the local supermarket doing who knows what. But after I got that first break at 16, I was not going to do anything else. I had my mind set on radio one way or another.
