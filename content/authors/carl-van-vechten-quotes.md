- An ordinary kitten will ask more questions than any five-year-old.
- The cat, it is well to remember, remains the friend of man because it pleases him to do so and not because he must.
- As an inspiration to the author, I do not think the cat can be over-estimated. He suggests so much grace, power, beauty, motion, mysticism. I do not wonder that many writers love cats; I am only surprised that all do not.
- A cat is never vulgar.
- There is, indeed, no single quality of the cat that man could not emulate to his advantage.
