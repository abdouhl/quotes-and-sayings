- I majored in theater at San Diego State. My one eye was on football, and my other eye was on Hollywood.
- I really try to take care of myself. I really put forth the effort to make a regimen just a part of my life. When I can't, for instance if I'm in a location someplace and I can't work out because of the schedule of the picture or whatever it is, as much as I normally do when I'm home, I still do something.
- I've made some films for the military that are teaching things like cultural awareness and leadership issues, that sort of stuff. And try to, in essence, look at what training they're doing and say, 'This is how you can improve the training from a humanistic point of view.'
- When I start to get that few pounds, which I try to monitor, then I just pull back. So it's really just being conscious.
- My first love was acting. I went to Sidney Poitier films as a kid. I sat in the theater and dreamed of being an actor.
- I've been fortunate. I've worked in a lot of things where I had those kinds of experiences with actors who were perceived as very macho guys, everybody from Lee Marvin to Charlie Bronson to Harrison Ford to Robert Shaw.
