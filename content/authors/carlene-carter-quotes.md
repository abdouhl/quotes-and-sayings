- If someone gets married at 15, they're either dumb or pregnant. I was both.

- I always have to just be myself. Anything else, I'm not happy, and it comes out musically.
- I grew up quick because my family was away a lot, and I took care of my sister. Then in my 20s, I went through my teens, with these 'wild abandon' things.
- The first time I went on stage as an adult was touring with the Johnny Cash Show. I'd sang as a child. But my grown-up initiation was as part of that band.

- Lots of girls marry at 16 in Tennessee.
- Basically, I grew up watching Carter girls on stage, watching my grandmother, my mom and my aunts perform. They used to say, 'Okay, Carter girls, you're on!'
- I do feel I'm responsible to carrying on the music. That's what I was charged with as a kid. When I was a little girl, I was told, 'When we are gone' - when you're a kid, you never think they'll ever be gone - 'you have to keep the music alive, the Carter Family songs, and add your own songs.'
- You can have a big hit and not get rich.
- I've always been one to throw caution to the wind, and my motto has been, 'Never have a dull moment.' Sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't, but I don't think I'd have it much differently.

- I've always been one of those people - once I start something, I have to get it all out, because it gets me.
- I love rock n' rollers.

- My grandma passed in '78, and that's the year I started recording. It's also the year that my dad retired from his career. So it's funny how torches get passed on, and you feel a responsibility to be connected to the music that they did and try to carry it on in your own way.

- I think, looking back, there was a lot of fear of success in me. When you are successful, you have to keep it up... it requires you to be responsible, and I had been pretty irresponsible.
- I've always had wanderlust to try and do different things, but I always return to the music of the Carter family.
- I grew up on the side of the stage. I never had a fear of an audience. I never felt like they were separated from us. We were all in the living room, and it happens to be a big living room. I continue to operate on that assumption.

- I have great stories. I am going to write a book.
- I like to do one thing at a time and do it to the best of my ability.
- It's a matriarchal family, the Carters. A.P. was the original head of the Carter family, but the women were always strong. There were no questions asked in that regard; you had better be strong.

- Whenever I've not known what to do, I've always gone back to the Carter Family because there was nothing like singing with my aunts and my mom to my grandma.
- Be yourself. And every person is unique.
- If someone asked me to do something I didn't want to do or didn't think was right, I wouldn't do it.
- I always wanted to be the rockin'est country chick in the universe.
- When I'm on stage, I know exactly where I am. It's not an ego thing or anything like that, but I am more in my body and aware of myself and aware of what I'm doing, and I feel more from that, from sharing the music.
- Everyone deals with loss. I'm no different, but we all find our ways of coming through things. Is it tough? Of course, but you find the strength to push on through.

- I'm really about my family and really proud of being a Carter.

- Grandma and Mama showed me that you always have to give as much as you can, no matter what.

- MusiCares was really good to me. I can't say enough how MusiCares helps other people. They really, really helped me. They have the greatest groups and support for musicians in recovery.
- I'm kind of a perfectionist about my songwriting. If I don't mean it, I don't think it's any good.
- I'm pretty much an open book.
