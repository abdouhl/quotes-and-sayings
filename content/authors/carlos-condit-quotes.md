- My wife is wonderful.
- I think I pose some problems for Georges that he maybe hasn't seen in the past.
- I don't think I need the rematch. I won the fight; I think I'd win a rematch. But the thing about it is, I want to be in big fights, fights where there's a lot of buzz, a lot of people wanting to see the fight, and a rematch with Nick Diaz fits the bill.
- In high school we'd grapple on my friend's trampoline for hours. Sometimes we'd have a party at a house. We'd take challenge matches and throw down with different people. By we, I mean me. My friends usually just watched until the other guy's friends jumped in.

- I think in training is where a lot of the injuries occur, or at least start.

- You know that when you fight a guy like Georges, there are going to be a lot of demands on your time and you just have to be able to find a way to deal with it. The most important thing is, I can't let my obligations to promote the fight interfere with my obligation to get ready to fight.
- I love MMA. I will be involved in some capacity, or in various capacities within the sport, after my fighting career is over.

- The difference is that the money I make from Reebok is per fight, meaning I have to fight to get that money. If I don't fight, there is no money. It's not based on me being a good spokesman or one of the faces of their company. It's a per fight thing. It's a very different thing. It's more like a fight bonus than a sponsorship.
- This career affords me the opportunity to accumulate money, power and respect.
- I'm just a regular guy, and I think sometimes the persona of an MMA fighter are these superstars who are larger-than life-characters. I'm just me and I only try to be me, a normal guy who is interested in a lot of things and happens to have a talent for fighting in a cage.

- I like to keep things exciting. Every minute of the fight, I'm trying to finish my opponent.
- Georges is a guy I've looked up to since I was a kid, before the UFC.

- My life is just like anybody else, there's ups and downs, but I always have to put it in perspective.
- Before the fight I don't like to talk a lot of crap about my opponents, it's nothing personal, when it comes to interviews or anything like that. But once I get in there, I make it personal. This is my livelihood, my life is either going to go up or go down depending on what happens right here, so it's really personal. I make that guy my enemy.

- By the time I got the notoriety to get bigger sponsors, the sponsorship tax had already taken effect, but I still had some pretty lucrative sponsors.
- I think Johny Hendricks has a puncher's chance. He's obviously a big puncher. He's got the power to make it a short night for GSP, but I feel like GSP is going to out-technique Johny Hendricks.

- When I was younger, I was a little less focused and I liked to have a lot of fun. I'd come in and do a five-week camp or maybe a four-week camp and do a five round fight.

- I do think that maybe, sometimes, I get overlooked. I think it's maybe because I don't present the average image of an MMA fighter.
- If you can use the takedown to control the fight, then that can be scored as octagon control. However, if you're taking somebody down, and not doing much with it, and if the guy gets right back up, then I think that stand-ups and escapes should also carry some weight in the judge's eyes.
