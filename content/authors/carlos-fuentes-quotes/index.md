- Perfect order is the forerunner of perfect horror.
- The new world economic order is not an exercise in philanthropy, but in enlightened self-interest for everyone concerned.

- Like all of Latin America, Mexico after independence in 1821 turned its back on a triple heritage: on the Spanish heritage, because we were newly liberated colonies, and on our Indian and black heritages, because we considered them backward and barbaric. We looked towards France, England and the U.S., to become progressive democratic republics.

- There must be something beyond slaughter and barbarism to support the existence of mankind and we must all help search for it.
