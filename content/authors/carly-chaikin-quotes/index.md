- I really knew with every fiber of my being that acting was - for lack of a better word - my calling.
- I've been so lucky to be able to go into such different worlds from my own, and that's what makes my job so fun. I just want to continue doing that.
- I really love 'America's Next Top Model.' I'm always tweeting about it, and people are like, 'You need to get a life!'
- I started painting at 17; I took a class at Brentwood Art Center. I thought about art school - but I'm just so not a school person.
- I love games. When I first saw 'Celebrity Family Feud,' I literally, in all caps, emailed my team and was like, 'Why am I not on this?'

- I guess I don't really feel like I have that much power to influence that many people.
- Technology and communicating with people online or through a phone or through social media - it's a false sense of intimacy and connection.
- I love playing a smart person and not that blonde deadpan.
- I've done figure drawing classes or whatever.

- I never leave my computer open. That becomes a big OCD thing. If I see people leaving their laptops open, I always close them.
- I'm so hyper-aware of everything around me and everyone and everything that people do.
- We don't know how to actually code, but I wish that I did. It's so much harder than anyone could possibly imagine - it's like learning German.
- I look at so many people's feeds like, 'God, your life is so cool. Like, I want to do that! Why don't I get that?' And I will get envious of someone's life, and we don't think about the fact that it's completely - not fake, but it's one single screenshot of just the good times.
- One of my favorite paintings I've done happened after I broke up with a boyfriend.
- 'Mr. Robot' has made me so much more aware of everything. I have to think about it.
- A jigsaw puzzle is my form of meditation. In New York, I glued all of the ones I did together and hung them up on the wall.
- I couldn't be luckier to wake up every morning and be so excited to get to work, even if it's five in the morning.
- There are times where we are shooting a TV show, and it goes very fast. But everybody has this freedom to still be artists.
- I can make eggs. I can do a quesadilla. But the last thing I want to do when I come home is cook and clean up dishes. I'm not that domestic a girl.

- 'Mean Girls' is literally one of my favorite movies. It's just such a classic. Everybody has seen it, and me and my friends quote it all the time.
- Playing a woman in the tech world never crossed my mind as a thing until people started bringing it up all time. People act like it's unicorns speaking English all of a sudden.
- I'm such a loser; I don't really go out. None of my friends are really actors, so in that regard, I still have all the same friends and do all the same things.
- So many of my paintings, people would be like, 'What more do you have to do?' But the smallest little things make all of the difference.
- I never have had blonde hair. I have never had straight hair. I never wear pink clothes or spray tan and I never wore heels to school.

- People do notice me - I'm always so surprised. When I dyed my hair blond for 'Suburgatory,' people would still recognize me from 'The Last Song,' when I had red hair, and I didn't even recognize myself.
- I just love human emotion and faces.
- At restaurants, I always get a kids' menu and color or draw on the tablecloth.
