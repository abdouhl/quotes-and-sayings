- For me, the winning strategy in any start-up business is, 'Think big but start small.'

- Sometimes I make it to parties and sometimes I don't. Social life is always something you can go back to.
- I've lived with someone and probably will again, but I don't want children and I have known that since I was little. My parents thought I would change my mind. My boyfriends always think I'm going to change my mind, but it never happened. I fall in love with my businesses.

- My parents sent me from Venezuela to the Convent of Our Lady, a boarding school in Hastings, which was horrible - like Harry Potter without the magic. Sometimes we went into town, and if we were caught chewing gum in our uniform, members of the public would take down our names and report us to the school.
- I have a funny accent in every language.
- When I was young I would spend more money than I should with my credit card but my father cut it off, so I had to find creative ways of making money.
- Investors are impatient and they are also desperate for the 'next big thing,' and they are not paying attention to the fact that the 'next big thing' can be an economic crisis that they have created by being very irresponsible with their power.
- I look for individuality in the artisans I work with for CoutureLab; a loving relationship with the product and care in the construction, along with the story behind it, make couture desirable to consumers looking for something that cannot be mass-produced.
