- I think I've gotten to the point in my life where I have to do everything that I'm scared of because you're not going to learn anything if you don't, so you just have to dive in the deep end and see if you can swim.
- If you looked at my music collection and saw an album that was a soundtrack to a musical, it's probably because I had bought it to learn the music so I could go and audition.
- It's nice to be able to go do what I love and come home - and get in my own bed.

- Just stay present in the moment, and what will come will come.
- I don't think I've grown up easily.
- I didn't know I was going to go into musical theater necessarily. It was never planned. I just kind of fell into it because I knew I wanted to act, and yet I had this opera training... I knew I had a voice.

- I like my cheese, I like my milk in my coffee, and nobody's gonna tell me any different.
- Alongside the iconic 'South Pacific,' I absolutely loved working on 'Bright Star' with Steve Martin and Edie Brickell.
- I love 'South Pacific.' It's got beautiful music. But there have been so many, you know, renditions of this in high school or college productions.
- I was worried that my voice would struggle with talking nonstop every night, but it's been fine.
- When you do something eight times a week, you fall into those little places where sometimes things can get a bit stagnant. That's why I always welcome a new face on the stage.
- 'Wicked' is so hard-core, physically and mentally, for the whole three hours, that doing that show for two years has pretty much prepared me for anything.
- To be honest with you, most of the time the ingenue roles are a little bit dull and boring, in my opinion.
- I'm just going to do things that I like to do, sing songs that I like to sing.
- Show biz! It's definitely not for sissies.
- Going to Broadway - then to be invited to the Tonys - I really tap into what that feels like now to fulfill lifetime goals.

- We will always need to be reminded that we are human. Art gives us that.

- I wasn't ready for 'Bright Star' to end when it did.

- Taking the arts out of schools is a terrible mistake.
- You have to laugh through hard things, right? How else do you cope?
- We all have to go through our own experiences of growing up.
