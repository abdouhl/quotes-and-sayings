- When you're drinking from a creek, it's not a good news story. When you don't have food for a baby, it's not a good news story.
- There are people who do everything for a calculative political motive. My only motive is a human motive.

- When someone is bothered by someone claiming lack of drinking water, lack of medicine for the sick, and lack of food for the hungry, that person has problems too deep to be explained in an interview.
