- I grew up in a uniform at school, and I sort of wish that I still had one and made to dress certain ways. My mother used to pick my clothes, I had hand-me-downs and things from her.
- Just because I go out with a boy doesn't mean I plan to marry. I go out with a lot of boys.
- If it was up to me I would wear riding clothes most of the day or jeans and a man's shirt.
