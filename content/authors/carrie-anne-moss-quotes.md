- Technology is just so fast. As convenient as it is, it's stressing a lot of us out. It's just too much, too quick. And I'm interested in that conversation.
- When I do work, I choose to see every job as an opportunity to grow, as an actor and as a person. My favourite part of it is being part of a team, with everyone pulling in the same direction.
- Are you gonna fuel your faith or fuel your fear? I'm all about fueling my faith, especially when it's hard to do so.
- Self-care is so much more than a beauty regimen or an external thing you do. It has to start within your heart to know what you need to navigate your life. A pedicure doesn't last, but meditating every day does.
- When I first had kids, I had a suitcase under my bed that I didn't even put away, and I was excited about going to all of these new places all of the time.
- Not for one second do I not, like, pinch myself that I've had a successful acting career for 24 years. I am so grateful. But it's unfortunate that we live in a society that really puts a lot of pressure on women to look a certain way and to age a certain way. I think that sucks.
- For me, the biggest thing is someone who's kind. I'm not into the bad-boy thing.
- I've never been interested in action movies. Definitely not interested in sci-fi.
- I was 30 when I did 'The Matrix.' When you turn 30, your life and your world view change. I remember feeling relieved - it was like I was seeing things in a deeper way.
- I grew up in a very middle-class life. I'm grateful for it - it has given me a lot of stability.
- To experience life you have to kind of face a lot of fears.
- Parenting takes a lot of creativity, and I embrace it fully.
- I just can't stand the sound of my voice sometimes, or how my face looks. There are always a few times at every premiere when I just have to cover my eyes when I'm up there.
- It's never a surprise to me that a job that I'm doing reflects what I'm going through or what I'm thinking about.
- When I was younger and I was getting older, I remember thinking that if I couldn't do it gracefully, then I would have to quit. You know, looking at yourself aging onscreen, it can bring up stuff. It's one thing to be aging in a job where your looks don't matter, but as an actress, it's so much part of your image.
- I'm a very simple person. I don't use computers.
- Every time I hear about a new show, and I see a show that is being created that is nothing like I've ever thought about, I just get so excited about that expansion. Because I started working when 'L.A. Law' was on. It was lawyers and cops.
- I have no major regrets. I've made the conscious decision not to look at life that way. I always try to learn something - to take something away from the situation.
- When I realised that what I do really well is play women who are tough and vulnerable, it was a moment of clarity. Many female characters either have one trait or the other, but I play both. I don't need to play characters who are like me. I can just do that with my life.
- There was a day when doing TV was like, oh my God, the end of your career. Now it's just like, we all want to do TV; we all want to do great TV.
- I'm not one of those people that needs to have all of the new gadgets or wants any of that.
- 'Chocolat' was a joy to make, as we were filming in beautiful locations in France and England. Lasse Hallstrom is such an amazing director - overall it was a wonderful experience.
- When the fights were over for the second and third 'Matrix,' I thought, 'Okay, I never have to do that again.' It's incredibly stressful.
- Before that film, I was nobody. Each job I got, I was so excited. Each paycheck I got, I thought, 'Wow, I'm getting paid to act.' But 'The Matrix' gave me so many opportunities. Everything I've done since then has been because of that experience. It gave me so much.
- The thing I love about music is that if a singer is good, let's say, you are instantly transported to that emotion. Acting is a more drawn-out process.
- I think everything happens at exactly the time it's supposed to.
- If you think about 'The Matrix' and how high-concept it was, it had these incredible ideas that really penetrated people's consciousness. It really was a film of awakening. I think a lot of people woke up around that film.
- My husband jokes that I'll invite people over for dinner and he won't know who they are or where I met them. But in my work world, I've never really been tempted to tell too much of my story.
- You'll have a guy, and they're aging however they're aging, and nobody really cares. If you're a woman, it's different.
- Who could have imagined that a platform like - I'll use Netflix as a example - that it could be so good?
- Tell me that I can't do something, and I'll do it.
- When I work, obviously the material is the first and most important thing. Then the director and who I'll be working with. And then the location comes into it. Where is it shooting? Because I have a family that has to uproot to do that with me.
- For me, I always nurse out in public. It never crossed my mind, because I was taking care of my child, and I was living my life. We need to know as women that that is normal and great and beautiful and OK. And I want to be part of that conversation - not making anyone feel wrong if they don't do it.
- I guess when you're carrying a film, you feel the weight of that because you're there every day, and you feel the weight of your character that way.
- I have absolutely no problem being thought of as an action chick because, quite frankly, very few women have ever done that.
- Jessica Jones isn't dressed in a sexy outfit to turn people on. She's gritty. She's a human being.
- When I did 'Memento,' independent film was where all the really good stuff was.
- Where it gets clear for me about the privacy issue is with my kids because they didn't choose this kind of life. I'm an incredibly open person, though - I'll tell anyone anything.
- Eventually I want to be a full-time mother who works occasionally - and being an actor you have that freedom.
- For a while, I was feeling so creative in motherhood that I had no longing to work. I felt that my children needed me, that I couldn't leave them for a second.
- I don't believe in being typecast. If I believed it, it probably would have happened to me. You attract what you make.
- I just know when I read something if it's something that I want to do.
- When I was a kid, I didn't know Canadians could be actors. I thought just Americans could get acting jobs.
- I was never afraid of taking the wrong job because maybe it would hurt me. I was more interested in the experience.
- 'Field of Dreams' made me realize that I wanted to live my dreams, to risk things for what I felt and what I dreamt of.
- You try not to judge the characters you're playing.
- That first year after a child, I kind of just hunker down at home - I surrender to that side of me. I don't try to get my body back or be in the world; I go the opposite way.
- I'm so damn lucky to make a living acting, but it's not that I love it, not all the time. If I couldn't act, I wouldn't die. I'm much more interested in the human aspect of life than the pretend.
- I love to play women who are strong and unapologizing and kind of rough around the edges and don't care what anybody thinks about that.
- In TV, I did scripts that were not well-written, and I learned how to make bad material okay. That's a hard thing to do; you can learn bad habits, but you can also learn to find something in anything.
- I think it's great that we're living in a time when everyone is being represented on TV and film.
- I watched the entire 'House of Cards.' I couldn't stop watching it. I was staying up until 4 o'clock in the morning. I just couldn't stop... I'm crazy about Netflix. I'm excited that the world we live in is changing so much.
- I'm such a private person, and sexuality is such a private thing. A sex scene is much harder than a fight scene. It's one thing to say, 'Kick higher,' but 'Kiss harder' - that's just crazy.
- I tend to play strong characters and people just assume that I would want to play romantic comedies, which I would love to do, but there are other women that do it so great and they maybe couldn't do what I do, play the kind of characters that I play.
- When you play a doctor, you have to look like you can do it but you don't actually go and do it. It's not like you learn how to cut open somebody and go do surgery. You have to think of a human being and not play the idea of what that would look like.
- I shoplifted. I was about five years old, and I took a candy from a store. We paid for three of them, but I took four, and I went home and cried. My mom took me back, and I paid for the missing piece.
- I trained for months to figure out how to ride a motorcycle. I have kind of a major fear of them. I have a major fear of going at fast speeds without any kind of protection, no helmet, an actor on the back with no helmet. I felt very afraid to do it. I love that I did it and overcame the fear and was able to do that.
- You're in another reality when you're looking down at your phone, walking across the street, and almost getting hit by a car.
- When I did the first 'Matrix,' after it came out, I had a woman come up to me and just thank me for Trinity because she was an action writer. She said she was getting really good opportunities now.
- Modelling asks you to be conscious of your outer self, but with acting, you have to let that go.
- I don't have any huge desire to show you all that I'm not tough and strong, that I'm all feminine and soft. That's not a huge longing that I have because I know who I am.
- 'Red Planet' was a tough movie to make, and I learned a lot about myself. To me, that's a lot more interesting than how a movie does.
- I love storytelling. I love characters that are complicated and layered, real people, that you see why they do what they do.
- I've never been attracted to sci-fi per se. People tell me I'm in a genre kind of movie, but it never crossed my mind that 'The Matrix' was genre.
- I feel so lucky that I had so many opportunities.
- I like stories about the world, where we're at. I like to explore humanity. I like to explore my own humanity.
- I love 'The Matrix' a lot - I am lucky and blessed to be a part of it, and I believe in it.
- I definitely acknowledge that 'The Matrix' and Trinity had an influence on female action-oriented characters in television and in film. I think it's awesome.
- I had my children, fell in love with mothering, yet couldn't find what I was looking for in terms of support or community. It felt isolating. I couldn't find 'my people.'
- As an actor, you really want to respect and honor the script. You want to try to be in the moment and you also realize that you're one part of a bigger picture and when they call action, you have your dance.
- I quit steaks for a while, but it's a hard habit to break.
- I've become a lot wiser over the years.
- I want to feel creative when I'm working. I don't want to just work for the sake of working.
- 'Revolutions' was beyond my wildest dreams. I just really enjoyed it so much visually, the action and then the story and the characters, the beauty of that. The love in the film really inspired me.
- In real life, I'm the kind of person that if I use Siri, I thank her afterwards.
- Even though I thought of myself as soft and squishy, I always had this great will and focus and was just so driven.
- People tell you the world looks a certain way. Parents tell you how to think. Schools tell you how to think. TV. Religion. And then at a certain point, if you're lucky, you realize you can make up your own mind. Nobody sets the rules but you. You can design your own life.
- I think that Trinity's just the greatest character that I could ever play. I don't expect to ever play another woman that wonderful. I have a lot of Trinity in me, for sure.
- I think we all have mechanisms that we use, each of us individually, to deal with pain that we've had or just dealing with life or whatever. Everyone's story is different, but we all have some kind of mechanism that we use to deal with stuff, that we create pretty young.
- It's really hard to make a living as an actor. I'm grateful as I drive to work every morning.
- It's extremely difficult and very challenging to be a woman in film and television. Just showing up in this business forces you to know yourself. But I learned how to deal with rejection and get tough when I was working as a model - it taught me how to put myself out there. In a way, my time modelling was a preparation for life.
- I've had moments where it's like being in the Matrix.
- After 'The Matrix,' I cannot wear sunglasses. As soon as I put them on, people recognize me.
- There is so much conflicting advice for mothers. Women finding out what works for them is the most important aspect. For me, being connected to myself helps me make decisions better to take care of my children.
- I learned how to act working in TV.
- I think a lot of acting is having the confidence to be open enough to try things and not be afraid of falling on your face and looking like a fool.
- Marriage is a lot more challenging when you have a demanding career.
- I am thrilled to be on a Marvel Netflix show. I'm excited that we're getting to watch this kind of content... It's groundbreaking.
- I think you have to take each movie for its own value. There will be those you'll roll your eyes over and others you can't wait to see. It all has to do with the intention. If someone's intention is just to make money and exploit something for profit, then it's not good. If it's thoughtfully done, the proof's in the pudding.
- I remember, when I was modelling in Japan, the agency would tell us that some guy wanted to take all the girls out to dinner, and I would be the one girl who didn't go - I didn't want to go out with a stranger.
- With scripts I've always looked at them and thought about kids, you know? Thought about the world and the impact... I won't do nudity and I never felt comfortable with that whole idea or things with huge sexual content - not my thing.
- One of the things that impacted me the most was in the 12th grade. I just assumed I would get the lead in the musical. Well, I didn't get it; I got the second lead, and I was devastated... my mom said something like, 'Often the supporting character is better.'
- You never know, especially on episodic television, you just don't know week to week what's going to happen.
- Feeling strong is important, and to feel in your body is a vital part of being a woman, regardless of whether you're a mother or not.
- Everyone has different issues, and I think for a great deal of women, those issues are self-esteem. And for me, I really wanted to understand it and get through it because I didn't want to be an actress afraid of getting older. I refuse to live that way.
- I'm not a horror fan. I get scared easily.
- When I was a kid, I don't think I even knew what being gay was, and now it's just part of our culture. It's changing so rapidly right now. It's great.
- When I was seven, my mom would come home every day, and I would have the phone book open to talent agencies, and I would have them highlighted.
- I will never do another kung fu movie again.
