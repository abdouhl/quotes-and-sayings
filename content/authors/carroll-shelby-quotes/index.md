- Every morning I wake up with new ideas.
- Porsche and BMW drivers are arrogant.
- I don't design cars. I'm not a designer. I know what I desire to be built, I know what the end result is, the horsepower, the competition we'll be working against - but I leave it to the people who work with me to put it all together. I don't do anything.
