- I listen to worship music before the game to calm my nerves and just go out and have fun. It's a game, and I try to enjoy it.
- A lot of guys have tons of talent, but it boils down to the mental side of things. Preparing and knowing your offense and studying the defense. Being able to read and react quickly. The mental side is often overlooked.
- You just control what you can control and just hopefully go win games and keep getting better.

- All men are wired to be in control of what's going on in their life.
- I'll be in a cadence, and I'll start to see one thing that a defense is starting to do, I'm like, 'I saw that two months ago on film.' And then that triggers whatever call you need to make.
- I didn't even have cable back in my college house.
- I don't get nervous.
- Honestly, I always told my coaches my whole career - we'll practice two-minute drills in practice, like, once a week and everything - I'm just like, 'Those are my favorite time of football.'

- I'm one that doesn't let the pressure or any of the outside kind of scrutiny, all those things, really get to me.
- If I scramble, I might get 5, 10, 15, 20 yards, but I'm not that fast. I always want to get it to the guys that can make plays.
- Being at NDSU and winning national championships, everyone's gunning for you. You got a big target on your back, and we had to be ready to go week in and week out. I think playing for a program like that, everyone's going to give you their best shot, and we embrace that.

- I actually hated hunting the first time I went when I was a kid. My dad took us deer hunting. We sat there for 30 minutes, and I felt like I was losing my mind. But in college, I fell in love with it. Football became a full-time job, and I needed an escape. I needed something that would mellow me out.
- I enjoy creating relationships with my teammates, my friends, and I genuinely care about people.
- As a junior in high school, I had some injury problems with my arm and shoulder from baseball, so I didn't play quarterback as a junior. I played a little wide receiver, linebacker, and safety.
- It doesn't matter if you're winning or losing. You've got to be the same guy; you've got to prepare the same.

- As a competitor, you want to get on the field as soon as you can. But you want to do best for your team, your career and everything. That's not up me to decide.

- There is just something about being out in open country, about seeing the sun rise over a pond, that's really beautiful.
- I'm going to go out and attack it and get better every day. That's the same approach I've had since I was just a little kid.
