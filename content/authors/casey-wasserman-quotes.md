- I have been in business a long time. I never had a successful relationship or partnership with any entity by issuing an ultimatum.
- I operated a professional football team in L.A. By no means was it the NFL, but I understand what it takes on some level to build and operate a professional sports enterprise in Los Angeles.

- I was willing to accept a bad reputation if I deserved it, but it was going to be based on my actions, not on anybody's history. I'm not running from my family - I couldn't embrace my family more. But I wanted to work in an industry where I could define myself, not be defined by my grandfather's history.

- This is one of the last unique things to do in the business of sports, to return the National Football League to the city of Los Angeles.

- It's no secret that I have, at best, a strained and awkward relationship with my dad. The Wasserman family - my mom, my sister, Lew and Edie - raised me. They are the people I define as my family.
- I love the entertainment business. I have a lot of friends in it, but it wasn't my passion. The sports business is what I am passionate about. I also wanted to define myself through something that wasn't linked to my grandfather.
- I, like most guys, sit around on Sundays, turn on 'NFL Sunday Ticket,' and watch a dozen-plus games every weekend, much to the dismay of my family.

- I don't need the NFL to be happy or successful.
- All the lessons I learned from my grandfather from the day I was born until the day he passed away served me well, and I think about them and use them every day. It was much more valuable than any business school could have provided.
- My goal was to build a meaningful sports business that operates at the highest levels in the areas of business that we compete in. I have an intense desire to be successful, and I'm extremely competitive.
