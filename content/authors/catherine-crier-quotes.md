- I loved being a judge, and sometimes I miss the power of the gavel, but this is a lot more fun.
- I did not see any major issues other than the jury substitutions. I can't know whether there's a problem there, until I read the transcript from the in-chambers conference, when those jurors were excused.
- The Petersons have not come forward in the press. Apparently they feel the media bears a large responsibility for Scott's conviction. It may be a while before we hear anything from them.
- I think either Robert Blake wither pulled the trigger or hired someone to do it, but it will be a tough case to prove. I think there's a very good chance he may take the stand, and that's what I'm waiting for.
- The judge decided in this case that both the state and the defense would have the opportunity to respond to certain kinds of press. This is one such instance.
- My children are all doing just fine. The mountain dogs are great in this weather. The yorkies are freezing.
- I grew up training and showing Arabs all over the US. Three of my four were bred on my farm in Texas. Thanks everyone! Hope you'll watch tomorrow. It's going to be another great look back.
- Over the years you encounter just about every kind of crime. It doesn't harden you, but you become capable of reporting on just about anything human beings can do. However, any time we're dealing with the murder of a child it is always difficult.
- I've heard rumors that the Petersons are writing a book. It will be very interesting to see what they have to say, but I don't know anything about the Rochas.
- It has been a wonderful five years. I'm excited about the many projects we're working on as we move into year six, and I want to thank everyone for tuning in. We couldn't do it without you!
- Some people may have noticed the new computer shelf at the anchor desk. Rather than phone calls, we want to take real time e-mails, and we'll be starting that very soon.
- Donald Beardslee is set for execution this week in California. His crimes were about twenty years ago, but it will be the first execution in California in quite some time.
- Obviously, the most memorable has a lot to do with the time spent on the matter, and the Westerfield and Peterson cases are up at the top of the list.
- The judge gave Michael permission to issue a statement. I think Jackson went way outside the bounds of the judge's intent. It will be interesting to see what the judge does tomorrow in court.
- I don't think Amber taped Scott or testified for money, but the opportunity certainly presented itself. It makes me a bit uncomfortable, but at least she never sold the story before trial to the tabloids.
