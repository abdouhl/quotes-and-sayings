- Sunday evenings often feel like the weekend is over before it's even begun.
- The great thing about having spent all this time on film sets is that I've been able to watch directors and how they work. I now know that this is what I want to do as well: to tell stories visually. But it's definitely my vision that I want to put across, nobody else's.
- In my entire career? I am so sick of being asked, What's it like to kiss Mel Gibson?
- Actors are accustomed to doing exactly what the director or writer requests us to do, and rarely get involved in that part of the process.
- Rufus? He's a grand kisser, and he's dead sexy.
- I have so many themes I want to explore, so many questions I'd like to raise and develop, and hopefully, I'll get to do just that.
- It's funny, I listen to friends who talk about back when they were 14, eight, 16, whatever, as if it was yesterday. Me, I've no idea what I did. It's all a blur, I'm afraid.
- If I'm not working, I have a habit of becoming rather insular.
- The events with Henry III happened, obviously the way it happened, liberties were taken.
- I'm so glad this is the last day of these thing, I get so tired of listening to my own voice.
- Britain is producing some of the worst films in the world. Our film industry is desperate to be part of America, and we just churn out flaccid imitations of bad films over there.
- I can't sit around doing nothing. If I'm not working, I have a habit of becoming rather insular.
- Left to my own devices I'd get up at midday every day of my life.
- I happen to have worked with male directors who don't understand women at all. Not at all. I'm flabbergasted by their ignorance.
- Occasionally I go shopping for clothes, but I find the whole thing a real chore.
- I listen to Radio 4 and put the iPod on shuffle. I like the randomness of, say, the Stones, then something from Nina Simone, Nick Drake or Bob Dylan.
- I lead a very boring life.
