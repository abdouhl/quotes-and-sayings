- If I don't have anything to sacrifice, I don't have anything to gain. From the Bible I have learned if you want something good, you must sacrifice.
- I used to train with my husband, Anthony Maina, but he is now too busy as a helicopter pilot, so we only run together when I do light jogging. I don't want to kill him before his next flight!
- I don't run anybody else's race. When the gun goes off, I must evaluate with my own body and see. Then, as the race develops, I run accordingly. So you can say that I do not have a set tactic for any race.
- I still do intense interval training. I like miles and quarters best. In races I can set my mind, and I believe I could break 2:20 again.
- If I have nothing to sacrifice, I have nothing to gain.
