- I like that my dad makes it clear he's there to make you laugh, not to showcase his emotional range.
- You want to have the perfect balance of hot and funny on your Instagram, but you never want too much of either... Don't try to add humility to your blatant 'hot' posts through a half-hearted attempt at being funny. You look good; just own it.
- To some degree, I think playing yourself has to be earned.
- I watch MSNBC while I simultaneously read the news. After dinner, I'm in my room for the night worrying about everything I saw on MSNBC.
- I've learned a lot from having a public Instagram, especially from my commenters, who have, in turn, taught me a lot about myself.
- People so often forget that their Instagram is more than just their latest post. Before posting, step back and look at the bigger picture, a.k.a. your 'flow.'
- All I want in life is to pet my dog and cat. After that, all I want to do is post photos of them. Mostly because they're the cutest things ever, but also because I don't have to worry about how ugly I look in the photo.
- Movies, more than anything I can think of, are a great escape from reality. My reality, in particular, needs escaping.
- Like most people, I am an enormous fan of movies.
- Never forget when posting something on Instagram that it lasts forever. Instagram is embarrassing enough as is, so be careful. A post might not embarrass you in this moment, but it's likely to in the future. So don't only think about yourself; think about your future self.
- I find the world extremely upsetting - not in the way an average person does but more in the way a crazy person might.
- As soon as I walk outside, I get depressed. If I see a dog, I'll get upset about how much it must suck to be on a leash. I'll get on a bus and tear up at the thought of how the driver has to go back and forth on the same street for eight hours in mind-numbing traffic.
- I work in between complaining.
- I worry about stuff like getting sick, home invasions, and how animals are in pain but can't tell anyone.
- It's so funny how social media was just this fun thing, and now it's this monster that consumes so many millennial lives.
- The endless definitions for feminism are exhausting. It's this, it isn't this, it's only this if you're this, etc.
