- I suspect that writers and other creators are never really finished with any work.
- If you're looking for a book that's not been influenced by 21st century popular culture and that's guaranteed to be a good read because it's stood the test of time, you can't go wrong with the classics.
- I really enjoyed reading 'The Da Vinci Code,' but from a literary standpoint, the book did not live up to the hype.
- I've heard that many fine artists have to turn their 'finished' paintings to face the wall - otherwise, every time they walk past, they are tempted to pick up a brush and make small adjustments here and there.
- Whenever the kindly uncles and aunts came over for a cup of tea and asked what I wanted to be when I grew up, it was always the same: an 'authoress', and illustrate my own books.
- The Internet is amazing.
- I grew up reading - and loving - stories by Andre Norton. I admired and idolised her from afar. Her stories helped shape my own internal world.
- Periodically, I return to the classics for inspiration and refreshment.
- I support the rights of non-humans wholeheartedly with my voice, my money, my presence, my writing and any other way I can.
- I was writing fantasy as soon as I could hold a pen.
- I am greatly impressed with the BBC's TV adaption of Charles Dickens' 'Bleak House.' The costumes, the sets, the acting and the screenplay are all superb. Every episode is riveting.
- In fantasy, you have licence to pick whatever you like out of history and fantasy, and you don't have to be accurate.
