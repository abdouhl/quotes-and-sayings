- I've been blessed to have a long career.
- I love stand up and it keeps me grounded, to say the stuff I have been thinking without anyone changing it.
- Politics move, as fast as Twitter, and for everyone to think that in four years America was going to be perfect is ridiculous.
- We as comics do want an immediate response from the audience. It's really quiet on the set, and there are only the producers, and the director, so a comic is looking for someone to give a reaction, even if it is the camera guy.
- I want to be a little more dramatic nowadays. I definitely want something big and funny, but I look for things that can just have people see me in a different light and let me mature as both an entertainer and an actor and a comedian.
- It is a big world that we live in, and people have a choice to love who they love.
