- Always stay grounded and enjoy everything that comes your way, whether it's the chance to go for a opportunity or getting one.
- Some of the best advice I've gotten was from William Hurt and Harry Connick Jr. I've really learned a lot from both of them.
- Of course there is school and sports, but I also like X-Box 360. 'Black Ops 3' is one of my favorites. I also like to play the guitar and piano.
