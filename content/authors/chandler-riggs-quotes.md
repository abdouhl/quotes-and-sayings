- Drumming is so hard.
- I really liked 'Super 8'. If Steven Spielberg is an executive producer of anything, you know that it's going to be amazing!
- I do a lot of video games - I have a YouTube channel where I record me playing video games with my friends and post it. That's a hobby I have and a lot of what I do in my off time.
- Unfortunately, the back log for writing for 'Walking Dead' is pretty backed up! Usually, we wouldn't see the scripts until the week before - or sometimes even the week of.
- I like to be in 'The Walking Dead,' and I like to play video games and just hang out with my friends and try to be as normal as possible, so going to college would be another really cool, normal experience in my life.
- I'm a teen boy, so I like seeing blood and guts. I know it's fake, but I'm having fun.
- Acting is awesome, but I'm really, really able to express myself creatively in music.
- I'm really into, like, electric pop music and dubstep, things like that.
- As an actor, you have a ton of downtime, so it's always good to have a hobby, especially another creative outlet outside of acting.
- I'm auditioning for anything that's good that comes my way.
- It's really cool to have people that really like my work as an actor and really like my work as a musician.
- We're not much of a camping family. When I was in Cub Scouts, we went camping once, and my dad snored the whole time and kept me up. It wasn't that fun.
- In a zombie apocalypse, I expect insane things to happen.
- The whole reason I do what I do, both in music and acting, is to make people feel something, to really relate to what I do on a personal level.
- I met Porter Robinson in, like, 2016 at Shaky Beats after one of his sets. Me and my friends ran backstage really quickly to try and get him as he was going to his trailer. We said 'Hi' really quick, and it was the best 30 seconds of my life; it was amazing. Getting to meet artists like that that have changed my life is super, super cool.
- At home, I have lot of pictures from 'The Walking Dead' and some stuff from comic books. At comic conventions, people will give me a lot of autographed stuff, so a lot of those are on my wall.
- I really like Deadmau5 and Coyote Kisses. And Foo Fighters too, I like rock.
- I auditioned for 'Spider-Man.' I auditioned for 'Han Solo,' all those big movies. I would love to do something like that.
- I produce electronic kind of music, like EDM kind of stuff.
- My dad was on 'Zombieland,' and I love that movie. So yeah, I think I like the horror genre!
- I love video games.
- I love zombies, and I love playing zombie-killing video games, so I was always super into the zombies, seeing how it all works and seeing the blood everywhere. I love that kind of stuff.
- I've never had a haircut where I've gone to a hair cutting place and they gave me an incorrect haircut. So I've been pretty lucky.
- I went back to school for the end of eighth grade and for all of high school, which was awesome.
- I don't really read any comics, but when I got casted on the show, I starting reading 'The Walking Dead' comics. I felt like I needed a better idea of the character.
