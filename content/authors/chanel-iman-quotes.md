- I don't like to fly. What's it called when the plane shakes? Turbulence, takeoffs... I grab my chair, close my eyes, count to 30, breathe, and pray.
- A good night's sleep is always the best way to wake up and go to work.
- Don't be afraid to express yourself through fashion!

- When I was a little girl, I lived for modeling and fashion - I used to love, love, love modeling.

- You learn to be comfortable in your own skin, and your body changes throughout life, so you can't sweat the small stuff.
