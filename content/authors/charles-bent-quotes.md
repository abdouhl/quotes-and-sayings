- Prayer is not so much the means whereby God's will is bent to man's desires, as it is that whereby man's will is bent to God's desires.
- The real end of prayer is not so much to get this or that single desire granted, as to put human life into full and joyful conformity with the will of God.
- If every call to Christ and His righteousness is a call to suffering, the converse is equally - every call to suffering is a call to Christ, a promotion, an invitation to come up higher.
- Intercessory prayer might be defined as loving our neighbour on our knees.
