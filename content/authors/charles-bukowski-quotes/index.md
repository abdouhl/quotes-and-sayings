- The difference between a democracy and a dictatorship is that in a democracy you vote first and take orders later; in a dictatorship you don't have to waste your time voting.
- My days, my years, my life has seen up and downs, lights and darknesses. If I wrote only and continually of the 'light' and never mentioned the other, then as an artist, I would be a liar.
- Show me a man who lives alone and has a perpetually clean kitchen, and 8 times out of 9 I'll show you a man with detestable spiritual qualities.
- Even though I write about the human race, the further away from them, the better I feel. Two miles is great; two thousand miles is beautiful.
- When everything works best, it's not because you chose writing but because writing chose you. It's when you're mad with it, it's when it's stuffed in your ears, your nostrils, under your fingernails. It's when there's no hope but that.
- You can do without a woman but not a typewriter.

- The thing that I fear discriminating against is humor and truth.
- I have not worked out my poems with a careful will, falling rather on haphazard and blind formulation of wordage, a more flowing concept, in a hope for a more new and lively path. I do personalize at times, but this only for the grace and elan of the dance.
- Those who have been writing literature have not been writing life.

- There are women who can make you feel more with their bodies and their souls, but these are the exact women who will turn the knife into you right in front of the crowd. Of course, I expect this, but the knife still cuts.
- Early on, when I was quite young and going from job to job, I was foolish enough to sometimes speak to my fellow workers: 'Hey, the boss can come in here at any moment and lay all of us off, just like that, don't you realize that?' They would just look at me. I was posing something that they didn't want to enter their minds.

- Humanity, you never had it to begin with.
- I would be married, but I'd have no wife, I would be married to a single life.

Only, when you write about 'bad' white males, they don't complain about it. And need I say that there are 'good' blacks, 'good' homosexuals and 'good' women?
- The more cats you have, the longer you live. If you have a hundred cats, you'll live 10 times longer than if you have 10. Someday this will be discovered, and people will have a thousand cats and live forever. It's truly ridiculous.
- I only type every third night. I have no plan. My mind is a blank. I sit down. The typewriter gives me things I don't even know I'm working on. It's a free lunch. A free dinner. I don't know how long it is going to continue, but so far there is nothing easier than writing.

- We have wasted History like a bunch of drunks shooting dice back in the men's crapper of the local bar.
- Sometimes I've called writing a disease. If so, I'm glad that it caught me.
- Almost everybody is born a genius and buried an idiot.
- There will always be something to ruin our lives, it all depends on what or which finds us first. We are always ripe and ready to be taken.
- I have no definite talent or trade, and how I stay alive is largely a matter of magic.
- When I write, when I'm going hot, I don't want to write more than four hours in a row. After that, you're pushing it.
- Most poets are young simply because they have not been caught up. Show me an old poet, and I'll show you, more often than not, either a madman or a master... it's when you begin to lie to yourself in a poem in order simply to make a poem that you fail. That is why I do not rework poems.
- Never envy a man his lady. Behind it all lays a living hell.

- I am a dangerous man when turned loose with a typewriter.
- I kept writing not because I felt I was so good, but because I felt they were so bad, including Shakespeare, all those. The stilted formalism, like chewing cardboard.
- What my character is or how many jails I have lounged in, or wards or walls or wassails, how many lonely-heart poetry readings I have dodged, is beside the point. A man's soul or lack of it will be evident with what he can carve upon a white sheet of paper.
- In my work, as a writer, I only photograph, in words, what I see.
- To not to have entirely wasted one's life seems to be a worthy accomplishment, if only for myself.
- I do not like the human race. I don't like their heads, I don't like their faces, I don't like their feet, I don't like their conversations, I don't like their hairdos, I don't like their automobiles.
- When I worked on a magazine, I learned that there are many, many writers writing that can't write at all; and they keep on writing all the cliches and bromides and 1890 plots, and poems about Spring and poems about Love, and poems they think are modern because they are done in slang or staccato style, or written with all the 'i's' small.
- Between the ages of fifteen and twenty-four, I must have read a whole library.

- I don't like jail, they got the wrong kind of bars in there.
- The free soul is rare, but you know it when you see it - basically because you feel good, very good, when you are near or with them.
- Censorship is the tool of those who have the need to hide actualities from themselves and from others. Their fear is only their inability to face what is real, and I can't vent any anger against them; I only feel this appalling sadness.

- Having a bunch of cats around is good. If you're feeling bad, you just look at the cats, you'll feel better because they know that everything is just as it is. There's nothing to get excited about. They just know. They're saviours.
