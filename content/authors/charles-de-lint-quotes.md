- A long time ago a bunch of people reached a general consensus as to what's real and what's not and most of us have been going along with it ever since.
- I've always known and been interested in people who are a little bit off the norm. I like to call attention to the idea that they are there, that they are real people, not invisible.
- One expected growth, change; without it, the world was less, the well of inspiration dried up, the muses fled.
- The beginning of a friendship, the fact that two people out of the thousands around them can meet and connect and become friends, seems like a kind of magic to me. But maintaining a friendship requires work. I don't mean that as a bad thing. Good art requires work as well.
- There are few joys to compare with the telling of a well-told tale.
- When all's said and done, all roads lead to the same end. So it's not so much which road you take, as how you take it.

- The few wonders of the world only exist while there are those with the sight to see them.
- I've always been interested in the outsider.

- Remember the quiet wonders. The world has more need of them than it has for warriors.
- The problem with children is that you have to put up with their parents.
- I think you're all mad. But that's part and parcel of being an artistic genius, isn't it?
- The road leading to a goal does not separate you from the destination; it is essentially a part of it.
- Without mysteries, life would be very dull indeed. What would be left to strive for if everything were known?
- Life is like art. You have to work hard to keep it simple and still have meaning.
- I want to touch the heart of the world and make it smile.
- The best artists know what to leave out.
- The thing with pretending you're in a good mood is that sometimes you can.
- Don't forget - no one else sees the world the way you do, so no one else can tell the stories that you have to tell.
- As far as I'm concerned, the only difference between fact and what most people call fiction is about fifteen pages in the dictionary.
- Often the magical elements in my books are standing in for elements of the real world, the small and magical-in-their-own-right sorts of things that we take for granted and no longer pay attention to, like the bonds of friendship that entwine our own lives with those of other people and places.

- If you're not ready to die, then how can you live?
