- I used to work for the Clippers - I sold tickets - so I was in the Staples Center all the time. I'm a big Clippers fan.
- I love breakfast - I like going to sleep at night because I know I get to wake up and eat in the morning.
- I always wanted to be a superhero.
- I think naturally you want to judge things.
- For me, I always admire anyone that's entrepreneurs or inventors.
- There is a certain swagger with vampires.
- I hope to see more programming, more shows, more actors of mixed ethnicity, more young kids of mixed ethnicity choosing to be in the entertainment industry.
- I like a lot of things about yoga - its an intro to good music; with each good teacher you study with, you learn a lot about them personally; it's not just about specific technique or poses. I also like Shavasana - not too many exercise routines let you nap at the end of them. You don't see nap pods in CrossFit gyms.
