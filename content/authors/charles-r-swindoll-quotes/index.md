- It's the most exciting thing to watch God work when I've asked him about something, to listen to him and watch him work. It's like this friendship, and it just grows and grows and grows and grows.
- You and I are, by birth, by nature, and by choice, inwardly depraved, which is to say that we are entirely corrupt. That's not to say that we have no good in us; we do.

- As far back as I can remember, my mother would have me down by the bed at night with her, praying. I can still hear her voice calling my name to God and telling him that she wanted me to follow him in whatever he called me to do.
- I'm not against screens, or new songs, or innovation. I just don't like the gimmicks. I want to know when worship is over that that leader's sole purpose was to glorify the Lord Jesus Christ.
- The swift wind of compromise is a lot more devastating than the sudden jolt of misfortune.
- Alleged 'impossibilities' are opportunities for our capacities to be stretched.
- I think it is important to begin with a statement in your speech that grabs the attention of the audience. I try to make my opening line 15 words or less.
- The world has changed and it's going to keep changing, but God never changes; so we are safe when we cling to Him.
- Sometimes I wake up before dawn, and I love sitting up in the middle of the bed with all the lights off, pitch-black dark, and talking to the Father, with no interruptions and nothing that reminds me that there's anything in life but me and Him.
- The wonderful thing about God is he knows what we need to persuade us.
- It is easy for Christians to have the false impression that once we have established a relationship with Christ, which we believe sets us right with God, the problems of life will somehow scoot away or they will slowly be removed from our lives.
- When you have vision it affects your attitude. Your attitude is optimistic rather than pessimistic.
- When you are giving people the gospel, you are giving them something to believe, and you have to set the stage for that. You don't just drive up and dump the truck and drive off.

- Not every Christian finds it easy to believe.
- When you have a sense of calling, whether it's to be a musician, soloist, artist, in one of the technical fields, or a plumber, there is something deep and enriching when you realize it isn't just a casual choice, it's a divine calling. It's not limited to vocational Christian service by any means.
- I want to preach till the last breath in my lungs runs out.
- I'm here today to warn you: I want you to watch out for the adversary. Guard yourself from any spirit of entitlement. Restrain any and all subtle temptation to gain attention or to find ways to promote yourself.
- I have no interest in returning to yesteryear. I love the conveniences and delights of today's time. I wouldn't go back if I could.
- We are all faced with a series of great opportunities brilliantly disguised as impossible situations.
- Life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react to it.
- The remarkable thing is, we have a choice everyday regarding the attitude we will embrace for that day.
- If I ever wrote a book on preaching, it would contain three words: Preach the Word. Get rid of all the other stuff that gets you sidetracked; preach the Word.
- Attitude is more important than the past, than education, than money, than circumstances, than what people do or say. It is more important than appearance, giftedness, or skill.
- Each day of our lives we make deposits in the memory banks of our children.
- 'We really shouldn't look like a church.' I've heard that so much I want to vomit. 'Why?' I ask. 'Do you want your bank to look like a bank? Do you want your doctor's office to look like a doctor's office, or would you prefer your doctor to dress like a clown?'

- Prejudice is a learned trait. You're not born prejudiced; you're taught it.

- A family is a place where principles are hammered and honed on the anvil of everyday living.
- When I think of vision, I have in mind the ability to see above and beyond the majority.
