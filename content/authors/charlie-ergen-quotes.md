- I believe it's less risky long-term to embrace change.
- I care about our employees more than anybody in my company. I care about my kids, too, but that doesn't mean I give them everything that they want.
- You either trust someone day one until they prove you wrong, or you say, 'I don't trust you until you show me I can trust you.' I'm the latter.
