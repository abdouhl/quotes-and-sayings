- 'The Princess Bride' was a movie that I watched all the time.
- Heights make my feet tingle; not sure if that is a phobia, but it isn't the greatest feeling.
- I did a short film called 'Disco' and won an award for Best Supporting Actor at an indie film festival, and that was nice. Hopefully there's lots more to come.

- I've always been interested in singing. My sister's a fantastic singer, and it's just something that's always been around. I play saxophone and guitar. I'd definitely like to pursue it, and it's something I'd like to keep going, if not as a career, then as a hobby.
- When I was eight years old, I asked my mum, 'Mum, can I do two jobs?' And she was like, 'Absolutely!' 'Cause I'd like to act for 15 years and then direct for 15 years.'
- After the 'Golden Compass,' I wasn't sure if I'd ever get another acting job.
