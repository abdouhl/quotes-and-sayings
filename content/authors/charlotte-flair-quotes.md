- Growing up with a famous father, and one who mastered his craft, it's one of those things where, do you really want to be in the same profession? I can't imagine the pressure on, say, Michael Jordan's kids. But for me, I think it's molded me into the character that I am today.
- I definitely think Natalya is one of the greatest of all time.
- I've played sports, and I've been a tomboy my whole life.
- I look at myself in NXT, and then I look at how far I've come on the main roster. I just think in my mind if I keep working as hard as I do and keep giving it my all that I will continue to get better.
- I'm built for wrestling. I have a high pain tolerance. My nose has been broken a couple times. Black eyes.
- I never pictured myself as an entertainer or a superstar or a model or anything like that.
- Me and my little brother never grew up wanting to be famous.
- If you had asked me in my early 20s or in high school if I was going to wrestle, I would have laughed at you.
- When the fans were watching my dad, you could never tell if this was real or is this fake, and that's what made him so special. Every ounce of energy went to being The Nature Boy.
- I had an athletic body my whole life.
- The dedication it must take to be part of R.O.T.C. was always interesting to me.
- My character, Charlotte, is very confident, and I try to be more like my character in real life. Not that I'm not confident, but I've really found my personal growth through work.
- I've always been a big fan of the Body Issue. Growing up as an athlete and having a very athletic body, I was always able to relate to them and look up to the athletes who posed for it.
- My job is healing to me. Charlotte is the woman you want to become. A strong, groundbreaking, independent female in a male-dominated world.
- I wasn't used to people critiquing how I looked. And then always hearing, 'God she looks like Ric Flair.' Yes, he's my dad. Who am I supposed to look like? I took it so serious and to heart.
- I didn't think of my size as an advantage or as something that I could use to be dominant. I didn't carry myself in the ring with the confidence that I should have.
- I think Asuka is a superstar. She is incredibly talented, and she made a name for herself even before coming to NXT.
- Everyone always says, 'You must have always wanted to be just like your dad.' But my dad's career had nothing to do with my journey.
- I started in NXT when we were still FCW in Tampa.
- It's so hard to tell people I'm in a video game... just because I grew up with my dad being in a video game.
- I want to be a larger-than-life superstar who is known worldwide, outside of the WWE.
- I wish I was more like my character. In character, I am the queen. I am strong. I am confident, sometimes cocky. I'm hard to beat. Out of character, I am a daughter, a sister, an aunt, a best friend and just the girl next door that likes Ben & Jerry's ice cream.
- Driving from town to town, living in hotels, sometimes not going home during the week because you have an appearance - you really have to be dedicated to do this job.
- I want to be the first female to main-event WrestleMania, and I just want to continue to get better and better and continue my dad's legacy.
- I think I definitely work out of my father's shadow, but it was hard in the beginning. But I would never change my last name, and I couldn't be more proud to carry on his legacy.
- No one understands what it's like to walk in the shadow of a famous father, let alone Ric Flair, in the wrestling industry.
- I never saw the female 'Ghostbusters,' but that's mainly because of my job, not because I wouldn't enjoy it.
- That's my message: I'm not alone, and neither is anyone else.
- My dad was my favorite wrestler growing up, obviously.
- In order to have your best good guy, you have to be that bad guy.
- I spent my whole upbringing in sporting camps. I didn't do cotillion.
- I almost think there's a mystique to not knowing everything about me.
- I idolize my dad because he was such a hard worker.
- I didn't even think about good guy, bad guy when I started. I was that unfamiliar with the business.
- Sitting front row with my little brother, my older brother, and my dad's wife at the time - seeing 80,000 people at the Citrus Bowl emotionally pouring their hearts out watching my dad retire - I didn't even grasp what he meant to the industry. I didn't even fully grasp it until I started wrestling myself.
- I never felt comfortable in my own skin, and I feel like I missed out on a lot of high school experiences because I was so worried about where I fit in because I was so confused.
- The most important thing is for women not to tear other women down. Everyone in our division is helping each other, and that's a message we send behind the scenes: that we are a unit and working to make the best product and highlight women as strong and independent superstars.
- I spent the whole time I've been in WWE trying to build this character who is unbreakable, who is not vulnerable, and who is not relatable. For me to let down my guard and let people in, I had to make that decision, and once I did, I had to own it.
- For so long, I was ashamed of my past, and I think that crippled me a lot in having confidence.
- I know, some kids, their parents have nothing in common and don't ever talk. I can call my dad at 3 o'clock in the morning, and I know he is going to answer.
- I'd love to be an action hero.
- I think with the Mae Young Classic, bringing in 30 women from all over the world shows what an impact women have in the company.
- Women tend to overthink things.
- Having new opponents re-energises us as talent, as we're not having to make new out of something that's been the same every week.
- I want to be a Roman Reigns; I want to be a John Cena.
- I do want to carry on my dad's legacy, but I also want to carve out my own path. I have to work harder, I think, just because I do have that last name. I don't want people to think that's why I am where I am in this industry. I put in the time, and I want to be just as good as my dad was.
- I didn't want to hurt my parents' feelings about how hard certain things were in my 20s, how hard it was when my dad left my senior year before I went to college.
- When I won the NXT women's title from Natalya at Full Sail, becoming the second-ever woman's champion for NXT, that's when I knew, 'Okay, I'm doing the right thing,' and that I could do this.
- I'm so proud of my body. I'm so proud to be an athlete. I wouldn't change anything.
- The biggest moment in our business is when you walk through that curtain, and if you don't believe in yourself, the fans won't believe in you or invest in you, and they see that.
- I was always around wrestling. I went to shows, but I never pictured myself where I am today. My brothers, David and Reid, were more into wrestling. When they wrestled, it was hard on my brothers because they were always compared to my dad.
- I guess because I never pictured myself wrestling, I find myself wanting to push every limit possible in this industry.
- I want to be the female Rock.
- I don't think there's anything else in the world that my dad loves talking about more than wrestling.
- I won the NXT championship as a heel; then the fans grew to respect - not love, respect - me. I was popular because I was seen as the next to get called up.
- 'Raw' wants to be the better brand; 'SmackDown' wants to be the better brand. A bunch of alphas on both brands.
- I hope I continue to evolve.
- I walked out very nervous, my first WrestleMania, and I had my dad beside me.
- You don't want to get complacent and just accept things - just because we've had those moments and we have come so far, you don't want to ever take that for granted, because the moment you do, it can all go away.
- My dad was able to wrestle so many great Japanese wrestlers.
- Professionally, I'm a perfectionist, and to allow people to see that maybe I wasn't always perfect or put together - that my actual personal life was very messy at times... it was scary to let people know that.
- I don't know if me and my dad have necessarily touched on this because we talk about Reid but not a lot. But me wrestling, I think, ultimately saved my dad's career and not only saved my life but definitely put a whole other chapter that no one saw coming because it could've been rock bottom after my brother passed away.
- I think what people don't realize is the transition from NXT to the main roster is a big jump. It's getting a whole new audience familiar with a certain character. If you debut too many women at one time, it's hard for the audience to get to know, understand, and see the rise of that character.
- They used to say a woman would never main-event a pay-per-view. I'm pretty sure I heard that from my dad.
- That is a message I hope to send and that I know all the other women hope to send: that no matter what your job is or what you want to achieve in life, anything you set your mind to, you can do.
- My dream match would be 'Queen vs. Queen' Stephanie McMahon.
- I am not necessarily a private person, but I am Charlotte Flair on camera, and that is playing a character.
- If you look at the Rock's crossover, Stone Cold, my dad too, in his era, I want to do that. I want to mean that much to the industry. That's just a matter of working harder every single day.
- Nothing is more important in our industry than respect.
- Negative comments in terms of body image are the hardest thing the women probably struggle with. But I think the best thing that we can do as WWE superstars is taking that negativity and using it in a positive way, because there are so many young kids on Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter to not send the message of hate on to.
- My dad was just so charismatic and witty. One day, I hope people say that I was just as good as my dad on the mic in my own way. I will never be saying 'Space Mountain' or 'limousine riding,' but I hope people say I can control an audience, that I was as captivating as him.
- We continue to hire women who seem to already be polished and who have already made it outside of WWE and whose whole goal was to get to WWE.
- The most challenging thing that female wrestlers face is time. Getting those segments on Raw, getting one, two, three, four segments on SmackDown, main-eventing a pay-per-view, being considered a face of the division... And I have said it since day one: I want to be an attraction for the company.
- I don't need approval from people who don't know me.
- I am all athlete, and that's important, that my looks have nothing to do with what I do in the WWE.
- When I first started in the WWE, I had a really hard time because I didn't look the part.
- When I debuted on the main roster, people just hated me. They were booing me. Social media got to me a bit. They were like, 'She's just there because she's Ric Flair's daughter.' I was like, 'Why doesn't anybody like me?' It really got to me.
- Most of Charlotte's character is really who she is. A lot of who Ashley is is Charlotte and the same with my dad. It's not like I'm the Joker.
- I could do a standing back flip at 13.
- Being undefined somewhat makes me nervous, but what I do know is I'm 100 percent confident in who Charlotte is.
- With injuries, every match varies. The black eyes are accidents. The broken noses are accidents. But the bumps from when we land on the mat, they're hard. I think it looks easier, or the fans don't really understand what's happening, but it does take a toll.
- I didn't start my career or, really, my life before I came to Florida.
- Charlotte Flair is continuing her father's legacy but paving her own, and she's opening the door for women all over the world to be superstars in a male dominated industry.
- To know how far I've come as a person and an entertainer and a businesswoman, I just hope I represent independence and intelligence and athleticism - everything that a woman should want to be.
- Why do something unless you are going to be the best at it?
- I want to know that I am putting 30,000 individuals in seats in arenas. That's my goal.
- Obviously, having my dad's last name, I think that's more the chip on my shoulder because it has been a mixed blessing. I always will have the Flair stigma, and I think that's where I deserve to be there or this, or I'm not just his daughter. I think that's the chip on my shoulder.
- My comfort zone and where I feel most natural is being a heel.
- If someone says something vulgar to you and you retweet it, now you're giving them a voice, and you never want to give hate a voice.
- If you find something that you're passionate about, your world can change.
- No one ever has a chance to get to know the real me because I do play a bad guy, and sometimes it's hard to soak in the comments or the negativity because that's the response you want to elicit. I am a normal person, but that's part of the job. I'm playing a character, and that's my role.
- Anyone can enjoy a wrestling match, but it's how you feel about that person that takes it to another level.
- The reason I don't do the Flair Flop anymore is because women's wrestling is being taken so seriously. I'll only perform something comedic like that at a house show.
- Even little adjustments in promos or being a heel, different mannerisms in the ring, every week there's something I can do better. The only time I get flustered is when I try to do too many things at once. It's better to do one thing each week and work on that.
- I spent 26 years watching my dad, and I didn't know anything about the business until I started myself.
- I played volleyball in college. I was the girl next door, never wanted to be in the limelight.
- We don't have an off-season. Every other sport has an off-season. It just goes to show how tough we are.
- When I started wrestling and then turned into the Evil Queen, I created this character who I needed in my personal life. This woman who is strong, intelligent, confident, empowering. That's what I needed in my personal life.
- The hard part for me was not the wrestling - it was showing emotion, telling a story, and being able to connect with fans. Coming out as Ric Flair's daughter and being called athletically gifted, it's hard to say, 'Hey, like me! You can relate to me!' It wasn't working, so I completely switched my character.
- I started very late in the game, and it hasn't changed my path to success.
