- Rob Zemeckis is an incredible director.
- I look 13, so was always being asked to play the crying girl.
- Yeah, uh, no, I play the cello. I played it, when, a lot when I was younger and it's one of those such a beautiful instrument. It's kind of the few things I've kept up.
- In a sense, my job is auditioning. I might not be working, but I never feel unemployed.
- Most of the version of Tudor history we know is through the eyes of Henry VIII.
- I've got a lot of friends who are actors so even when I don't have auditions of my own, I'll be working on someone else's scenes with them.
- The biggest auditions can be the most freeing. The odds are always stacked against you and you always expect someone famous to get the part, so it eases the pressure.
- I need to go out and write and produce my own stuff and collaborate with other women.
- French actors are so much better and cinema is better over there.
- That's the problem I have, I don't have a filter. It's something that I'm working on.
- Auditions are just another chance to act - that's why I love them.
- It's mad that in pretty much any other industry equality is expected as a standard, but in the acting industry, because there are such fewer parts, we seem to accept 'I'm a girl so it's harder for me'.
- You have a real freedom when you don't have to worry about what you look like.
- Whenever I get a script I skip from the leading role to the second or third friend as I think, 'no one famous will want that so I might get it!'
- I, uh, well, it's the first thing that you do when you go to a job, you go out and do the footings and you see all the clothes, and for me, that really helps kind of create a sense of who that person is and what she wears and it, yeah.
- In my life, I'm not very cool.
- I am an actress largely in my living room in Clapham Junction! We have the Hollywood sign printed on the wall, though!
- I did some chemistry testing - which is one of my favourite things. You go and flirt and see who you fancy and then they check out who had the best chemistry.
- I will say I would much rather play someone who isn't the most spellbinding beautiful person because I am not that person and I don't want to worry about my angles or how good I look on that day.
