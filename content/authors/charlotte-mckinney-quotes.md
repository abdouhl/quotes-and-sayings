- I'm really into fitness, so my hobbies are yoga, Pilates, and working out.
- Growing up, I used to go to an inlet to lay out and try to meet all the surfer guys.
- I'm really interested in finding good tips to stay in shape, and I love being in the gym, and I love doing yoga.
- I have moments where I feel incredibly ugly or fat, and it sucks, you know? I'll usually try to keep a positive attitude because I'm really so grateful for where I am and the life I get to live, but I definitely have to work hard not to feel insecure.
- I can really stir up a conversation. Every time I go to a meeting or a casting, I try to make it as light and funny as I can. I'm always making really awkward jokes. You have to make life fun and not take it too seriously. I may look like I'm very serious and into my work, but if you knew me, I'm just a jokester.
- I'd always tell my mom, 'I want to be famous like Claudia Schiffer or Brigitte Bardot.'
- I admire her so much, but I'm not the next Kate Upton.
- I work out really hard, and I stay on my diet all week.
- I can feel so bad about myself, especially if I start to pay attention to the kinds of stupid comments around the Internet.
- I wanted to be something and prove to girls in high school, and to my mum and dad, that I could be really... spectacular.
- Whenever people talk about dyslexia, it's important to know that some of the smartest people in the world, major owners of companies, are dyslexic. We just see things differently, so that's an advantage. I just learn a different way; there's nothing bad about it.
- I'm only 5 ft. 7 in. tall, and for modelling, that's small, so I wasn't getting signed, but I kept on pushing.
- I've had such a hard time with dyslexia my whole life. When I was a child, I didn't learn to read until I was a lot older, and I was behind in my classes; it was such a challenge.
- Don't be afraid to go up to the hot girl on the beach.
- I remember asking one of my agents, like, 'Hey, is this Instagram thing good for models, or is it bad?' And they said, 'No. Keep doing it. Heidi Klum, or whoever, has millions of followers, and that doesn't hurt them.' So, I kept with it. I think it definitely helped.
- You'll always find me at a good sushi spot. Once, at a restaurant, a cook came out from the kitchen and asked for a picture with me. That was flattering.
- I'm not interested in just being the hot girl. I'm really goofy, and I love laughing, and that's such a big part of who I am.
- I'm really getting into acting and TV. 'Sports Illustrated' is a big, iconic brand I'd like to work for, too. But TV and acting is really funny and a bit more exciting than shooting all the time.
- I'm embracing what I have. I'm a curvier bombshell with big boobs. I'm not high-fashion. I don't do runway. You won't see me at Fashion Week.
- I think I'm most excited about traveling and shooting and spending time in L.A. I have a great talent agency there and, you know, working with my acting coach and really putting in the time and effort to transition into the acting.
- I love fitness, yoga. I love fashion. On the weekends, I try to relax. I have pretty crazy weeks. I like spas and nice dinners. I'm not much of a club person. I like to hang on the beach in Malibu.
