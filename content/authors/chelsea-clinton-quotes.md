- Millennials regularly draw ire for their cell phone usage. They're mobile natives, having come of age when landlines were well on their way out and payphones had gone the way of dinosaurs. Because of their native fluency, Millennials recognize mobile phones can do a whole lot more than make calls, enable texting between friends or tweeting.
- When people say crazy stuff about me or my family, I don't take it seriously.

- Role models really matter. It's hard to imagine yourself as something you don't see.
- My parents always asked me what I thought, listened to my opinions, articulated their diagnoses of our challenges at home and abroad, and shared their ideas for how to build a more equal and prosperous country. I always felt part of their call to serve and part of my father's journey.
- Service is a deceptively profound way to prove not only what you can do for the world, but what you can tell the world to expect from you and your ambitions.
- When my father announced his campaign for president on Oct. 3, 1991, I had already cast my vote in favor of his candidacy.

- I had seen people who had lost everything and everyone they loved to war, famine, and natural disasters.

- I hadn't planned on or expected to have a public dimension in my life.

- My grandmother, who passed away at the beginning of November, had a core adage in her life that 'life is not about what happens to you but about what you do with what happens to you.'

- My father has always been such a doer.
- There's something else that my mother taught me, public service is about service. And, as her daughter, I've had a special window into how she serves. I've seen her holding the hands of mothers, worried about how they'll feed their kids, worried about how they'll get them the healthcare they need.

- Through their 'Making a Difference' franchise, I am excited to work with NBC News to continue to highlight stories of organizations and individuals who make their communities and our world healthier, more just and more humane.
