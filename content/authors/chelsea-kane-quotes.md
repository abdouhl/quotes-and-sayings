- 'Dancing With the Stars' really opened a lot of doors for me, and I'm so grateful for that.
- I think my best teacher and my best study was theater in general. It taught me a lot of patience and a lot of hard work, and I think that theater teaches you that you've got to know your stuff because you only get one chance.
- I think if we were going to worry about teen pregnancy being glamorized, we should worry about shows like 'Teen Mom'. If people are going to want to have children at a young age because they see it on TV, I think that depends on the type of person you're dealing with.
- I just want to go to work and play dress up, like, for the rest of my life.
- I think my advice to other actors would be to get in classes. Get out in front of people. Put up scenes in front of your peers.
- I don't know if I could date a single dad. It would depend on the guy.
- If I could perform on stage with any musical act or performer, it would be Sugar Ray, just to fulfill my childhood dream of singing with Mark McGrath.
- I love my Disney fans. A lot of the kids want to grow up and push away from that image, but I don't feel that way at all.
