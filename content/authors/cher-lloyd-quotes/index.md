- I find it so funny how people that don't write the music, and have no involvement in it, can make such huge decisions on behalf of artists.

- As a writer, I'm always mindful that not everyone is going to feel the same way I do about something, so my emotions are just my emotions.
- I am a touring artist - I get a kick out of it, like, a huge kick.

- When you sing live, you cannot expect any artist, except for the amazing Beyonce or GaGa, to get it right every time.
- I don't want anyone to feel sorry for me because of the fact I haven't got any true friends! I'm fine the way I am.
- I'm really, really short. And when I'm on TV, it looks like I'm tall, but I'm really not. I think I'm like just over 5-foot, or not even. Yeah, I'm really small.
- I used to sit in my bedroom and think that all of my favourite pop stars go on stage, they sing, and then they do other normal stuff. I didn't know what goes on or what you let yourself in for.

- I don't want people to say, 'So, what do you think about that Cher?' and for them to reply, 'She's okay.' Okay is not good enough. I want them to either love me or to completely despise me - I mean, call me all the names under the sun. I love it.
- Facial scrubs are always good.
