- When I was 16 I told my dad I wanted to be a pop star. He told me, 'I'll give you until the end of the summer. If you're not earning money by then, you're going back to school.'
- I got married, had two kids, watched a lot of football, drunk a lot of pints, etc.
- I ripped all the cartilage out of my hip in a water ski jumping accident. I am a bit accident prone.
- I'm sure I was a cocky git.
- A friend of mine, Thomas Jules, who was the lead singer of Rudimental, is an amazing DJ, so I've got him to come down and give me some tips.
- These days the whole 'American Idol' and 'The X Factor' and all that stuff has opened up doors for songwriters like me. I get songs on their albums.
- When I first released 'The One And Only' nobody knew it was going to be so big. I just thought, 'Oh, this is what happens when you release a record? Brilliant! Let's release another.'
- Nostalgia is an amazing thing.
- I'm working on an Americana-style album because I live in L.A. now.
- Kristina is a model. It's that old rock star meets model cliche.
- By the time I was 17, I was in a band, writing songs and playing solo piano at weekends, in pubs or at weddings.
- I've never really been that into cars. Maybe I just thought that's what pop stars do. They buy flash cars. I was just playing it up a bit, being flash.
- I was 19. 'The One And Only' was my first record. It went to No. 1 and I was this big star. I thought that was what happened when you released records. Of course that is not normal. It's a great record and I'm still really proud of it but I think it was a bit of a fluke.
- I like posing in cars, with my shades on. That's what cars are for. They're not to get you from A to B. They're to pose in.
- I was only a young whippersnapper at that point. I was in pubs playing Barry Manilow songs. I didn't know what to expect.
- 'The One and Only'? Down the years I've had a slight love/hate relationship with it, but I can't not love playing it.
- I think that probably the most important thing in a career is not to believe your press and not to take yourself seriously.
- My kids are the most important thing in my life.
- Over the years I've worked in everything from R&B, pop, country to rock 'n' roll to heavy rock, alternative... if there's one thing that my manager tells me off for, it's that I am a little too eclectic, that I have trouble focusing.
- People still look for that elusive record deal, but you still can release records on your own, which is amazing.
- I've done panto down the years, I love that. So never say never for anything.
- I still get knickers thrown on stage, but not as much as they used to. In fact, I get bloke's boxer shorts thrown on and someone rolled a coconut on stage the other night.
- Whether it's right or wrong, people listen to people who are famous. I want to utilize it for good.
- I've worked with the company - James Dean Events - on several occasions and their festivals have always been really successful and well run. I've even got to know the people that own the land. It's always a really warm crowd and a real community spirit.
- I'm a massive fan of Ben Folds, I have been for ages.
- I've seen the highs and lows not just of the music business but of life.
- In hindsight I might have chosen a different path and everything but I still make music, I have a core following that wait for every new album and it's given me the career I have now.
- My dad was in the Tremeloes.
- I don't have anything against reality TV.
- I enjoy doing my gigs and I keep my hand in by putting records out now and again. You can't really get over the buzz of playing live though.
- Originally a promoter came and asked if I fancied doing a few student gigs. I was a little nervous. I thought they wouldn't know who I was and, worse still, not care. The first gig was in Lincoln. It sold out. I had knickers thrown on stage and people were chanting my name. I can't remember having a reaction like that - even in '91.
- In fact one of the main reasons I head out to Los Angeles quite a bit is because they have the most amazing sushi bar in the world.
- Yeah... my wife says no more reality shows in case I break another bone or something.
- When Dad heard 'The One and Only,' he said: 'That's a smash.' Dad played the demo through the speakers at Abbey Road, where we were recording. I was a huge Nik Kershaw fan and was desperate to meet him, but everyone else hated the song.
- I'm actually enjoying the touring life, although the worst part is being away from my three young children.
- I'd been spending way too much money. I wasn't very sensible. I got to the point where I couldn't afford to even pay the mortgage.
- It's when you think too much is when it all goes wrong.
- When I look back at old footage of me back in the early '90s, it almost looks like a cartoon character, or something.
- I know a lot of fans like the beginnings of 'The X Factor' where you get all the crazy people and everything, but for me it's almost like taking the mickey out of people with mental illnesses.
- I've heard about Honey G and there's always someone like that who gets through. It's a little bit of politics involved in that with 'The X Factor' which I'm not a big fan of but at the end of the day it's a TV show.
- I absolutely love sushi.
- I bought everyone in my family a car, I bought my mum a convertible Mercedes. I bought a studio at a ridiculous cost - just insane.

- My day job these days is I am writing, producing and developing young artists here in the States, in between working on my own stuff.
- It really was... my life was not my own, put it that way. It was fun, I was only 19 at the time but it was crazy, it was really, really crazy and people camped outside my parents' house and it was a nutty time, really crazy and I'm glad I don't have that right now.
- My day job is that I write songs for other artists and if I'm not on the road I'm in my studio.
- People have so many preconceptions about me. I always knew it was going to be an uphill battle.
- My record label dropped me, and I'd been spending way too much money.
- My dad was lead singer of the Tremeloes and he gave me advice.
- I never got the chance to step back and appreciate what was happening to me.
- I've worked with a lot of 'American Idols' over there and I've worked with the 'German Idol' winner and had songs on 'Australian Idol.' It's a place for songs. 'The X Factor' U.K. is the holy grail.
- It feels like I've been dancing for years.
- My wife tells me off as I'm always coming home with either skateboards or guitars.
- I have to say that talk of me living as a tramp at one point is completely false and I think that's been added to my entry in Wikipedia, but I have been asked about that quite a few times.
- It is true I've written songs for other performers; I've worked with Tricky, Tears for Fears, A1, HearSay among others.
- That's the thing about ice skating, you can just fall awkwardly like that.
- I remember there was days when I would do six, seven countries in a day, you'd just be flying around and I'd get up in the morning and not know what I was doing. In one day I'd fly to Belgium and then off to Sweden and then do a gig in Leeds, I literally didn't know what I was doing from day to day.
- Before I knew it, we were No. 1 all over Europe and in the U.S. Top 10. We were living the dream, girls camped outside the house and everything.

- Of course I had a good family, so that kept my feet on the ground.
- My income started to dry up a couple of years after I had the big success with 'The One and Only.'

- Well I do like to give myself a challenge.
