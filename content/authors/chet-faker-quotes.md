- Rather than trying to create an audience, just try and create music that feels good to you.
- It's like my parents' musical tastes are the mother and father of my music. It's their fault for making me so emotional and in tune with my emotions!
- I came second in a 1,500-metre running race at school. I knew I couldn't have come first, so second was my version of first.
- I would consider my diary serves the same purpose as going for a walk or a run. They are all physical ways of clearing a mental landscape.
- I just love a slow groove. I feel so comfortable in it. But I listen to a lot of fast music, a lot of techno and house.
- I like a lot of independent brands - Melbourne's Kloke, Handsom and Neuw Denim, and Bassike in Sydney. It's easier to be proud of what you're wearing if you've met the people behind the brand and there's more of a personal story.
- I have an addictive personality. I was addicted to computer games... and then all that obsessive nature just piled into music.
- It was definitely hard when I first started, and by no means do I consider my live show to be where I want it to be; it will develop step by step for the rest of my life.
- Our generation's grown up with the Internet, so it's an extension of our social lives; it's an extension of us. It makes perfect sense for me to use that medium.
- When I was 21 or 22, I realized I was never going to be something else - I had to be a musician. I can't commit to anything unless I love it.
- I'm a humanist at heart: at the end of the day, we are all human beings.
- My biggest enemy for the longest time was my head. When I first became successful, it made me anxious because I was overthinking everything, and you hear so many 'fail' stories.
- I'd wear all APC if I could afford it and wasn't embarrassing to go head-to-toe in one brand.
- All my ego wants is to be sitting by a lake in Italy. It doesn't want to be backstage, warming up.
- Sleep is getting to be like gold.
- That's what helps me keep playing: the idea of giving something to others. Because personally, I've had my fill.
- I think that connection with humans is so important. Sometimes I'll do this monologue and talk to the crowd, like, 'Come on, let's really connect here.' I don't think a lot of people understand it's a two-way exchange. Some people go to a show and are like, 'Yeah, you make me feel.' That's not how it works.
- On my Instagram, lots of people tag me in photos of just dudes with beards, and they're like, 'Oh my God, I met Chet Faker' and I'm like, 'That doesn't even look like me.'
- Sometimes it feels like it's show after show after show - like it's 'Groundhog Day,' and you feel like you're lost in the system.
- The day you stop clapping at a gig is the day your soul dies.
- I second guess everything I do musically, and I often could spend hours on, say, one snare sound.
- I love that way dance music can put you in a trance.
- I remember a concert for a visiting girls school, and that was the first time I ever sang - it was always about girls - that was the main thing. But somewhere along the line, it became a cathartic thing.
- I don't start my show at 200%. I like to go in slow, warm up the crowd, and bring them along with me. To hear everyone singing along is so great.
- Chet Faker's a reference to the late Chet Baker. I'm a big fan of his vocal style; it's quite fragile and soft, and that was a style I wanted to take on.
- I think you can move to everything, but with some music, you just want to sit still. That's me, anyway.
- I think a lot of artists get confused when people like their music; they think that means people know and like them. I'm sure there's an element of truth to that, but to me, the music I make is what I'm most proud of. I prefer to focus on that and for people to focus on the music, too.
- I have had a pretty hardcore crash course on living out of a suitcase. Some people take consistency in their lives for granted. When you have little to none, you discover it's kind of a nice thing.
- You can't rush an art form.
- I think diva is an inevitable outcome of the industry, and I don't think it reflects on the person at all. You take a normal human being, and basically, for 24 hours, seven days a week, apart from sleeping, you introduce them to places and things almost every minute that are brand new.
- What I like about Americans is if it's good music, that's the only thing that matters.
- You can turn something into art just because of the way you tell people to look at it.
- All of my friends are really good dancers, which was initially why I never danced - we'd go out, and they would kill it, and I'd be like, 'Yeah, I'm just gonna sit at the bar.'
- Ultimately, I love making music more than anything. And I want to do that for ever. I don't want be on the top. I just want to keep doing what I'm doing.
- Music to me is about being honest, and it's what I've always pictured music as. I don't see the point of expressing yourself if you are going to be cryptic about it.
- Most of my inspiration comes from mistakes, so every time I make a massive mistake, that usually affects me so much that I have to process that via song.
- Learning to appreciate those things that aren't related to success has proved the biggest lesson.
- My high school career counsellor said I shouldn't pursue music as a career.
- An album is like a book or a diary or a snapshot... It just feels so like the end of a chapter when you finish one.
- I hate fame. There's this assumption that everyone wants it - that by being a musician, I've signed up for it at some point. But personally, what I signed up for is sharing my music. I've always said I'd rather have four No. 10 songs than one No. 1 hit.
- I always try to work hard and get things done as soon as possible, but never at the loss of quality of the product.
- Sometimes I have to deal with trolls, and I just block them. But most of the time, Twitter's heaps of fun, actually.
- Hype is a good thing, but it can also be a bad thing if you aren't prepared to back it up.
- I think the most-played record in our house was the 'Big Chill' Soundtrack - so Smokey Robinson, Aretha Franklin, the Temptations, Otis Redding. I think that's where I got my love for a good hook, a good soul hook - really smooth and warm and from the heart.
- I studied audio engineering at university. The background I am from, music was never seen as a viable career; it was always a hobby.
- I love performing. The more I do it, the more I grow into it.
- In my eyes, I think it's important that if you're doing something you're proud of and that is genuine and authentic, you have a responsibility to bring that to as many people as possible, just for the sheer reason that there are musicians out there who are manufacturing emotions that aren't genuine.
