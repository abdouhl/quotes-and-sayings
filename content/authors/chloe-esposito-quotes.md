- I know everyone thinks Dad is a little bit crazy with his training, because we train a lot harder and do more kilometres and stuff than most pentathletes. Training is full-on. It's seven or eight hours a day.
- Not too many people know what a pentathlon is or what's involved, which is why visiting schools is good because they can learn about it at a young age and hopefully try it out.
- If it wasn't for my dad, I would never have known about pentathlon, because it's not popular at all in Australia.
- You might have a great fence, a great shoot, run, and swim, but you might get a dodgy horse. Each country supplies the horse; you get 20 minutes to warm up with it, and then you have to do the jumping course. Pentathlon's difficult because everything has to come together.
- Ever since I knew Dad did pentathlon, I wanted to do it as well. I have seen all his old photos, and he still has his Olympic riding jacket, and that makes this even more special.
