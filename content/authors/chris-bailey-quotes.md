- I was listening to the first record the other day, and it sounds remarkably contemporary.
- I am very proud of The Saints and I'm very glad that I've been associated with them all these years, but the next record is the best record... has to be the philosophy for any band that remains even halfway decent or vibrant, and that is kind of where my head's at.
- I always liked the intensity of the recording.
- For a time that you couldn't get a gig if you didn't look a certain way.
- Lots of people I know have bootlegged tapes of performances and if they play it I will be transported back sometimes with happiness, sometimes with horror.
- I have never been over fond of scenes anywhere.
