- I love how Hollywood still wants to perpetuate the myth that beaches in Southern California are warm at night.
- I've been writing songs on little pieces of paper since I was a little kid, and it's just always been something I've done.
- Performing live is easy in front of an audience.
- Let's be honest - it's hard for me to get more sexy, but I'm giving it a go.
- This is going to sound ridiculous, but I read in an interview with Lil Wayne that he recorded a mixtape of something like 50 straight minutes of him rapping all of his material because he felt like he could never move on to the next phase of his musical exploration if he didn't get it down on tape.
- I lived in a little shack in Santa Monica, and I was working on 'The O.C.' and when it started airing, I took my laundry down to the laundromat like I always had, and so many people along the two blocks I walked and in the laundromat stopped me and asked me for photographs.
- I grew up in Maryland on the East Coast - you know, close to D.C. but sort of in the suburban, rural area - and Nashville felt very, very homey to me.
- I thought, when I came to Nashville, I was going to hook up with some of the top country writers in town and write some country tunes.
- I grew up in a neighborhood that was surrounded by farms. There was a horse farm behind me and dairy farms on either side.
- Being an assistant in a computer lab was the worst job I ever had. It was boring. That was when I was in college.
- Music kept me sane between acting jobs.
- I describe my years in Los Angeles as 12 years of culture shock.
- I have these songs that I've been playing for so many years. They're so intimate and close to me. And these are songs that probably a major label would not be interested in - some of them, anyway - interested in putting on a record.
- As actors, we're so used to the axe falling, and then we all go our separate ways. I can tell you, the feeling amongst the cast in 'Nashville' is, we don't feel like we're done. It feels like, in some way, we're just hitting our stride.
- I have gotten better at saying to myself, 'Relax and just take this moment in. Appreciate it for what it is.'
- I'm a fan of Otis Redding. I've sat around trying to copy some of his phrasing and learn from him, but it kinda falls short.
- The music is something I've always done and always loved but always really kept for myself. Something I do for me.
- I've found it really hard to finish writing songs when you're writing on not just your schedule but somebody else's.
- I'm honestly kind of scared of horror films. My girlfriend always tries to expose them to me. Being in a scary movie and seeing all the fake blood and stuff definitely takes away from the magic and kind of humanizes scary movies to me now, though.
- I think a movie is a great date idea for younger couples. It takes the pressure off, since something else is entertaining you. It's also good for couples in a very comfortable relationship.
- What I've run into more than anything is people who have a belief that they know who you are. Type-casting happens because people actually write you off. 'You are in this box. That's all you are; that's everything you are.' It's a very de-humanizing experience.
- I ran into Ben McKenzie a couple of times on the streets of L.A., and we hung out one time, and that's it.
- I am actively campaigning for 'chest hair' to become an Olympic sport.
- There are a lot of opportunities to do a lot of great, wonderful things, and if you say yes to them all, you will not sleep or breathe or eat.
- I really do love the theater, and as you get deeper into your career, it gets harder to carve out the time to do theater.
- CNT was a good fit for 'Nashville,' and 'Nashville' was a great fit for CNT, and so timing was right. You know, they're investing more in scripted television - the show brought a lot of more eyeballs to CNT, eyeballs that are interested in country music - so, I mean, it couldn't have been a better fit.
- I grew up playing the saxophone. I joined the jazz band in high school, but somewhere along the way I realized the guys who strummed acoustic guitars at parties were the ones who got the attention. So I asked a friend to show me a few chords, and when I moved to L.A. I spent a lot of time practicing my guitar.
- I've always been a fan of Buddy Guy as a guitarist, as well as Stevie Ray Vaughan and those blues guys. I'd say those are pretty big influences on me.
- In terms of exploring an identity in the country music world, what I realized very quickly was that there are people who have been performing country music since they were kids. It's very much a part of who they are; very much that jazz and blues are a part of who I am, because I grew up listening to and playing that kind of music.
- I'm somebody who values anonymity - not just in terms of not wanting people to recognize me or wanting my privacy, but I value anonymity in conversation.
- I think the 'Jaws' shark and the 'Shark Night' shark would fall in love and make sweet babies.
- When I came to Nashville, I was sort of experimenting with a new identity, experimenting with the country world and country writers. I realized I needed to take a step back from that, to be true to some of the music I've been doing over the years and to put that into the world before I move forward and redefine myself again.
- Success has a lot of different plateaus. But I first felt really proud of myself when I was doing an off-Broadway production in New York City.
- I've often been described more than once in my life as very much like a golden retriever: just sort of happy and excited to do whatever it is, even if it's as simple as retrieving a ball and bringing it back ad nauseum.
- It wasn't until I became involved with 'Nashville' that I thought I had opportunities to record my music in a way that I would want to put it out into the world.
