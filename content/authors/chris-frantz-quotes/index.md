- There is not that much of a generation gap these days.
- We're the Tom Tom Club and our studio is the Clubhouse. It a way of making it a little more personal.
- I don't know how much influence we really had, because we never put our pictures on the albums or anything and we never really promoted the Talking Heads connection, because we wanted to keep it separate from Talking Heads.
- I remember going for the first time to a place called The Roxy in New York because you can see people breakdancing there. That's the only reason I went! It's amazing, kids are still doing that.
- As much as we love playing the small clubs, we'd really like to get ourselves in front of a larger audience. I'm not talking about arenas or anything, but nice theaters and larger clubs.
- If a band is really good and the chemistry is unique, it should continue. But I guess David is just very happy doing his solo career. He's got a different band every time he goes out.
- One always hopes that you're going to have influence and staying power, but you never know.
- Besides the two Christmas things, we've got a about a dozen new tracks we're working on.
- Our studio is kind of built into our home, so it's a place you can ramble, and we can do a pretty good recording here. The band is really comfortable her.
- We used to really feel like the band was our family.
- Everybody's going through a lot of stress these days, no matter how well off you are and how many advantages you have, it's a stressful time in everybody's lives.
- We get these overzealous young men and their girlfriends. It's happened occasionally where one of them will lean up against the front of the stage and the guy is behind her, and it starts off as just dancing and then it gets into something more.
