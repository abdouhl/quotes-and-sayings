- By the time I was 7 or 8, I wanted to be a comedy writer.
- Yeah, I love being famous. It's almost like being white, y'know?
- Black people have been qualified to be president for hundreds of years. George Washington Carver could have been president. I could go on with a list of black men that were qualified to be the president of the United States. So the Obama victory is progress for white people.
- I can't cook, but I have a nice book of menus... and I can plate and set the table.
- Right now, my job is that I'm like an ambulance chaser. I've got to look for movies with white guys falling out of them.
- Every now and then I'm in a situation where someone doesn't recognize me, and I experience racism. Things like not being buzzed into a store or sitting in first class on a plane and having someone ask to see my ticket four times.
- Sometimes people offer you plays, they offer you parts, but they only offer it because I'm famous.
- I used to hang out with grandfather all the time because he used to pick me up from school sometimes, or drive me to my mother's, so I'd be with my grandfather a lot. I used to watch him write his sermons.
- My first year on 'SNL', I made $90,000 dollars. And I bought a red Corvette for $45,000 dollars. I'm thinking, 'I've got 45 grand left!' Taxes didn't even come into my equation. At the end of the first year of making 90 grand I was 25, 30 in the hole. We live in this baller, spend-money culture.
- You can write a great country record and still be angry. Who's angrier than Toby Keith? He's angrier than the average 10 rappers.
- Men lie the most. Men lie all the time.
- When I hear people talk about juggling, or the sacrifices they make for their children, I look at them like they're crazy, because 'sacrifice' infers that there was something better to do than being with your children.
- Karaoke isn't fair when you're a comedian. The whole idea is to get people laughing and enjoying themselves, and I'm a professional funny guy.
- There's some downsides to being famous, which are not even worth mentioning. But to combat the bad sides of being famous, you really should take advantage of the good sides. The good sides are, you can use that fame to get projects you might not normally get.
- It's like, hmm, there's people with $2000 weaves that could have bought health care with that weave money. They don't have insurance. People want what they want. And I guess that is a reason we have this big credit card problem and a lot of these foreclosures.
- I'll go back to comedy clubs when they get a real no-camera policy, the same way they did with smoking.
- I've seen women who don't have great relationships with their dads, and it all comes down to this: You have to tell girls you love them every day.
- If I find a comedy club where no one's camera works, I'll go.
- Hollywood's just not funny.
- When I started out in comedy, it was common knowledge that it took about 10 years to get good. And that was okay because it took you about 9 years to get on television.

- Welcome to the 77th and last Oscars.
- I live in a neighborhood so bad that you can get shot while getting shot.
- The thing that surprised me the most is just how much money women that weren't rich were paying for their hair. When you're in a beauty parlor in Harlem next to abandoned buildings and somebody's paying five grand for a weave, that's a bit much.
- I don't believe I can offend you in a comedy club. I don't believe I can offend you in a concert. A comedy club is a place where you work out material; you're trying material.

- No film critic's going to say it, but 'Madagascar 3' is better than 'The Artist.'

- Black people dominate sports in the United States. 20% of the population and 90% of the final four.
- Show me one guy or woman as funny as Rodney Dangerfield or as good as George Carlin, Richard Pryor, Bill Cosby, or Joan Rivers. There are a lot of good comics out there, no doubt, but as far as the quality of the comics goes, I think what you have is a bunch of situational comics.

- School shootings were invented by blacks... and stolen by the white man.
