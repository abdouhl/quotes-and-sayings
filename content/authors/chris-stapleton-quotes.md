- I like to put something on and want to listen to it again once I get done listening to it, not feel like I need an ear break.
- I don't know that my voice ever makes sense anywhere, necessarily. I would sing bluegrass music, and I don't fit in there; I would sing rock music, and I'm probably a little too hillbilly for that. And country, I'm too much rock n' roll for there sometimes.
- I don't make records to win awards. I make records to make records and hopefully make the records as good as they can be.

- My earliest memories of music are probably my dad listening to a bunch of outlaw country, but also old R&B and Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin. But, you know, I had rock phases and liked more modern R&B acts. I've always listened to all kinds of music, and I like all kinds of music.

- I like songs that make me feel tough. Like 'Back in Black.' You want to hear it again and get in a fight.

- I think it's OK if somebody likes my music and likes Sam Hunt's music, too. And I think if we're both selling records, it's good for everybody. I think it allows other records to get made.
- If you think about what everyone else will think, you forget to just make music.
