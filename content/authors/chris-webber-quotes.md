- I just want to fit in and win games for my team.
- You're guilty until proven innocent. Perception is reality, that's the way that it is in this world.
- Sitting behind the bench at games is the hardest thing I've ever had to go through because basketball is really most of my happiness. So when I can't go out there and exert energy and have fun and things like that, it kind of puts everything else into perspective.
- I've had hard coaches all my life.
- I've been in the league 12 years. To sit on the bench and complain about the way things were, that doesn't get anything done. I don't know. I'm playing for a championship and trying to make the playoffs. My effort has never changed.
- I played in the playoffs with teams that were known for flopping and you do not get respect.
- I'm a professional; I feel I'm one of the best in the game.
- I make money, money doesn't make me.
- If someone were to ask me before I made the NBA, you going to have to go through all this, you're going to have to sign your soul away to play in the league, I still would have done it.
- Basketball talent is basketball talent, no matter if it comes from the suburbs or the city. Take the time to know and understand me before you judge me. Only God can do that. Roses do grow from concrete!
- I think that my career speaks for itself and shows the type of player I am. I have never had a teammate who didn't enjoy playing with me. There are always going to be skeptics, but chemistry will definitely not be an issue.
- I'm not trying to win individual awards.
