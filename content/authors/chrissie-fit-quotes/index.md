- I don't feel the need to have to break out of anything or prove that I'm 'edgy.' Been there, done that mentality. I'm just ready to tackle on new projects that are challenging and help me continue to grow as an artist.
- I'm Cuban. Both my parents are Cuban. My grandparents are, too. Although I have no idea where Fit comes from.
- I am so proud of my heritage and of being Latina. I would most definitely consider roles in Latin America.
- My grandfather left Cuba when Castro came into power and literally left everything. He had two suitcases and two kids and showed up in New Jersey and waited for my uncle to meet up with him. Imagine - there were no cell phones back then!
- I was teased up until high school about my hair, being short, my high pitched voice, and just anything you can think of.
- My first song, 'Just Becuz,' was co-written by the awesome Baby Bash.
- I was singing before I started acting. As a kid, I would always perform at the big family parties.
- I remember seeing 'Pitch Perfect' and loving it right away. It's hilarious!
- Sometimes you need a good laugh, and then there are times when you need a good cry.
- I sang throughout school, and it was always my passion. For whatever reason, acting took the front seat, but all of the projects that I've been doing seem to have some sort of musical element to them.
- I was afraid of the dark until I was, like, 15 and slept with a nightlight.
- I'm super girly and like to wear skirts and dresses all the time.
- I was invited to a dinner party by an ex, and I was convinced that he wanted to rekindle our relationship. I prohibited my friends from coming with me because I didn't want to make it awkward for them when he professed his love to me.
- I am kind of being a little selective in what I do, so it takes a little bit longer, but it's worth it in the end.
- I know a lot of a cappella groups, but none of them are doing backflips while singing, for sure.
- I would do a 'Pitch Perfect 29', where the Bellas take on the Spaniards instead of the Germans. All the girls would have to learn Spanish. I'll teach them!
- My family is very creative. My grandfather played the guitar in Cuba. My sisters, my mom and two aunts would do harmonies, so I would see them and think, 'I want the attention.'
