- People have maybe, sometimes, said that I can, occasionally, be a teeny bit edgy and judgmental.
- I am so happy that I married a comedy writer. He's never not without a joke. No matter where we are.
- I grew up in New York City, and both my parents worked. On weekends, we'd go out to the country, and on Sunday nights we'd come back. Sometimes we were a little cranky - it was a long drive. But we could always look forward to one thing: my mother's ziti and meat sauce.
- I always have two pairs of glasses: geeky black Warby Parker frames and Wayfarer Ray Bans. Those are key!
- Before I go on selling the joy of working with your spouse, I should make something clear: Although we have a great marriage, it is as trying as anyone's.
- My husband and I have a deal, which has worked out well: He cooks one Sunday, I cook the next. The kids set the table, and we eat in the dining room together, just as I used to do as a kid.
- My kids won't eat all whole-wheat pasta, so my trick is to mix some in with white pasta. Cook the whole-wheat for about a minute and a half before you add the white pasta.
- When I was asked to write an article about what it was like to work with my husband on a TV show, I assumed it was because people thought it would be titillating. He's a creator/writer/producer, I'm an actress; there must be lots of gossip, in-fighting, maybe some crazy-sexy time on the set, right? Actually, it's pretty tame.
- I am very protective of my family.
- I like to carry a nice bag because then I can wear t-shirts and jeans all the time!
- Courtney Cox got me this Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer. She wears it, too! If one of us finds a product we love, we buy it for the other.
- I love Goody's Spin Pins. They're super cheap and look like corkscrews. You just gather your hair and screw them into a bun.
