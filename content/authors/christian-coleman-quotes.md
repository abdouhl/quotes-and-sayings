- The thing you're working so hard for are milliseconds. Saving a 10th of a second from 9.82 to 9.72 is huge. There are a lot of things I can fix from my technique standpoint and making sure I hold my form at the end of the race, to not slow down as much as I usually do.

- I've always been a little kid compared to the guys I've competed against in terms of body development. I've always looked a lot younger, so naturally my body got a bit bigger and stronger. I combined that with a good work ethic, good mindset and focus.
