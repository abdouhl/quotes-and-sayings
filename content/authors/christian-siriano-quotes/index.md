- I hate hearing from anyone ever saying, 'Oh, you only make clothes for models. That's so annoying,' because it just never, never is the case. Our top-selling size is probably a 12.

- Shoes are a big part of your look. I think that if your outfit isn't really something special, then fun footwear is a great way to jazz it up and make your ensemble more interesting.
- We have dresses that I actually think look better if you have more of a bust or more of a hip... or whatever it is. That's why, in a collection, it should be as diverse as you can be. I think there should be options for a lot of different types of bodies and women.
- A bad investment is going for quantity over quality. If you're trying to be careful with your wallet, especially with the economy right now, you have to choose staple pieces.
- I think a lot of women aren't really sure about their bodies, so they don't always get their fit right, whether it's too tight and too sexy or way oversized and doesn't show figure at all.

- I'd rather buy clothes than buy a bed.
- For me I'm a luxury brand trying to prove to people and the industry that it's not about being a TV celebrity in any which way, it's about being a designer and having a business and being successful at that.
