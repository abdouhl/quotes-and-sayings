- When the attention started to be about my figure, I was surprised, because it wasn't something I was focused on.
- One of my favourite messages about 'The Pirate Fairy' is that the story is about appreciating your own talents.
- We were probably the last people in the country to get a VCR and we didn't have cable. There wasn't any admiration of glamour, no, 'I want to look like them or have that lifestyle', because everyone in my town had the same lifestyle. So I didn't think, 'Ooh, a movie star's birthday!' I just thought, 'What?'
- I have classic and feminine taste. I'm definitely drawn to vintage-inspired and ladylike things. I like an accentuated waist, and a strong shoulder works well with my figure.
- Sexiness is about confidence and individuality. I can't keep my eyes off the women you see in cities like London, New York and Paris - the way they carry themselves and put themselves together are always so unique.
- I'm constantly saying that I have bad hair days when I'm in New York. It's so hard. I've been lucky enough to jump immediately into a car, head straight to the location, and stay in the air-conditioning.
- When I first started dating my husband, I had this weird fascination with the circus and clowns and old carnival things and sideshow freaks and all that. About a month after we started dating, he bought me this amazing black-and-white photo book on the circus in the 1930s, and I started sobbing.
- We have defined these characters - people always expect to see me in a pencil skirt. When they see me out of one - much like when they see Jon Hamm's hair when it isn't slick - they say, 'Wait a minute, you're all 2010!'
- As women, we feel we can't ask for things. There's been a lot of research done recently and, more often than not, if a woman goes in to ask for a raise, she'll get it. But she's thinking, 'Do I deserve it? I've got to give a list of why I deserve it.' Whereas a man will just go in and ask for a raise. It's so scary.
- I sort of feel like 'Mad Men' fans are like sci-fi fans because they are very, very devoted, and they're very loyal and very excited about it.
- I was obsessed with the Canadian novel 'Anne of Green Gables'. I decided I was Anne of Green Gables. There was something that spoke to me about her, and I wanted to have her beautiful red hair.
- I don't think it's not feminist to use every tool you have to succeed, and part of that is being a woman - presenting yourself in a certain way.
- I thought, well, you might see curves there, but that's just a bone - so even if I lose weight that's not going to change anything. That's how I look. That's my shape. Do the math.
- Back when I was modeling, the first time I went to Italy, I was having cappuccinos every day, and I gained 15 pounds. And I felt gorgeous! I would take my clothes off in front of the mirror and be like, 'Oh, I look like a woman.' And I felt beautiful, and I never tried to lose it, 'cause I loved it.
- I've been telling everyone for weeks now about how I get to play Lois Lane. It's a big deal. There are a few characters throughout your life which everyone knows and this is one of them. I can't wait.
- I just keep praying for Joan to get her power back. To resolve her problems and rise to the top. To fight back!
- I get kind of bored on the treadmill, but I do it. And I do a little bit of weight training. I'm really into the BOSU ball. You have to balance on it, and I do weights and squats on it. I'm pretty good at it, I feel sort of like a Karate Kid.
- I met a lot of young girls modelling and they were like, 'Oh, I'm running around town and people are taking my picture', while I was saving receipts and learning how to be self-employed.
- Everyone assumes we're always going to have a cocktail and a cigarette in hand. Fans expect us all to be dressed up all the time. They always say to me, 'You look so young. You don't seem as tall!'
- Getting to wear beautiful fashion is the most fun part of the job that has nothing to do with the job.
- I think Joan's advice would be: always know more than anyone else, always be discreet as possible. And never cry at work.
- I found myself at the beginning of 'Mad Men,' because I wasn't a sample size, spending an exorbitant amount of money on a nice dress that I would never wear again because someone would say - 'Christina Hendricks wore this dress twice.'
- My parents didn't exercise, so it was not something I saw was good for you or fun. I wish I had grown up knowing to do that.
- I'm either in heels or barefoot.
- I guess my mom raised me right. She was very celebratory of her body. I never heard her once say, 'I feel fat.'
- Anytime someone talks about your figure constantly, you get nervous; you get really self-conscious.
- The way we dress on 'Mad Men' is so associated with old photographs, with people's parents and grandparents.
- I use Redken color on my hair and use mild shampoos that don't strip your hair of color. If I need to, I'll use a good colored mousse in between.
- If I get any private time in my trailer, all of a sudden I'm doing sit-ups and push-ups.
- I had been on several shows that were meant to be the big ones, that would go on forever, and they didn't.
- I like a man with a nice, self-deprecating sense of humour.
- Some of the things people have said about me, well, they're unbelievable.
- I would hope that people didn't think I was anything like Joan! It's very hard for me because Joan says such cruel things all the time. It sort of makes me cringe every time I read them because I think, 'Who could be so horrible?' To be able to deliver those lines and do them with a coolness, yet still make her likable, is a bit of a challenge.
- It's a tough business. To my parents or to their friends, I was not a success, but to me I was a huge success. I was having a blast. I was working on shows I loved, I was working with actors I loved, and I was making a living as an actor. And I loved every second of it.
- It is so exciting to get a phone call saying you're going to be working on a Disney film.
- I love cocktails. My specialty drink is a gimlet with a little egg white in it so it gets frothy. I really like rose water - sometimes I'll add it to champagne.
- I have women coming up to me and saying: 'I love your character! She's so empowered. She takes control; she gets what she wants.' That's another side of her. And I respect that in Joan. She says and does things that I would never allow myself to do.
- I think calling me 'full-figured' is just rude.
- Sexiness is about being an individual and having conviction about what that is.
- Over the years, it seems 'Firefly' has only gained momentum rather than lost it. I still get letters from people who watched the show - I get more 'Firefly' than 'Mad Men' letters.
- To be honest, the real reason I did 'Drive' was because of Nicolas Winding Refn, the director.
- I'm an ambassador for the Make-A-Wish Foundation, and one of the children, his wish was to go to the Emmys, so he's going to be my date, along with my husband, and my dad and his girlfriend. So we're going to have a really fun night and it's going to be really exciting. I'm really excited for him to experience that.
- I went to a very mean school and was bullied like crazy. I was a bit of a goth with purple hair, and I was also part of the drama group, which was filled with actors and writers and wasn't really accepted by the rest of the school.
- In person, I wear jeans and flip-flops, and people are so shocked. They tell me I look so much younger than they expected.
- I was a goth girl in high school. Perhaps the powdered white face and the black lipstick were not the most attractive. I felt fabulous at the time but looking back, uh, probably not the best idea.
- We're really spoiled on 'Mad Men.' Lots of television actors use the down season to go out and get creatively fulfilled, but I feel the opposite. Anything else I get to do is just icing.
- I just thought I would work in a hair salon and do community theater.
- I come up with the silliest excuses when it's time to work out. I'll be like, 'Oh no! Now I have to go and find some socks.'
- As for the herbal cigarettes, for the most part I don't smoke as much as the guys do. I'm usually just strutting around a bit more so I don't actually have to be inhaling it. I'm lucky because I do have scenes where the cigarettes work beautifully to punctuate certain things I'm saying.
- Caftans are just the perfect solution to what to wear at home. I love Camilla Franks', but I also get great vintage ones on eBay.
- I adore the incredibly tight clothing! My own wardobe's changed - I've streamlined a little bit and definitely learnt from Joan's sleekiness and tailoring.
- I like the old-fashioned, vintage-inspired swimsuits with halters and maybe a little ruching, and the longer cut that's almost short-shorts, like Ava Gardner used to wear a lot, right?
- When you're doing voice work, you're in a bubble where you just think about the story and the words. They record you on video while you're doing the voice work, so they capture how your face is moving and the gestures you make.
- Some people are way less creative than you wish they were.
- I love anything that's sort of surreal and with fantasy.
- I have faced rejection in this business because of my appearance, but that has only made me stronger and more determined.
- Any woman who is currently with a man is with him partly because she loves the way he smells.
- My mother never said to lose weight. Diets were never a big deal. My mom was always beautiful and voluptuous and curvy, and I always thought she was gorgeous.
- I have a problem keeping my mouth shut. I usually speak my mind. I'm trying to learn my lesson.
- I like salty, creamy foods. I could sit down with a bag of chips and French onion dip and go to town! That would be on my last-supper list.
- I started doing community theatre as a way to make friends, and that was when I caught the acting bug.
- I know plenty of people who don't have children. And I also get a lot of people who say, 'Thank you for speaking out; my family don't understand why I don't want kids.'
- I tend to take things personally. But I can only take so much, and then I jump back. I have strong survival skills.
- I dyed my hair about 42 different colours, and kids can be pretty judgmental about people who are different. But instead of breaking down and conforming, I stood firm. That is also probably why I was unhappy.
- It is tricky because I do wear a lot of vintage on the red carpet, and usually when I'm getting ready, I'll say, 'We need to make sure that I don't look like I'm in a Scorsese film today.' Sometimes I do something a little bit more modern with my hair. You have to mix it up.
- I was a dancer until I was 19. I never had to worry about working out or what I ate. So I've really had to train myself to get down to the gym.
- You can never predict what's going to be successful, so you have to do the one you really love, and I picked 'Mad Men.'
- I've always been someone who really watches other people, human behavior. To watch it and be able to express it through your version has always been really exciting to me.
- It just seemed so odd as people had never commented on my body before. Every woman obsesses over her figure, but I was happy, I felt sexy - I never thought about it. I know this sounds naive, but I honestly never expected this kind of attention.
- I really do love being outdoors - I mean, you'd never think it in my high heels and pencil skirt! But I really do miss the smell of hay and farms, and I like milking a cow.
- No man should be on Facebook. It's an invasion of everyone's privacy. I really cannot stand it.
- My husband says, 'What Joan walk? You've always walked that way!'
