- Praise is nothing that accumulates. Praise is a sequence, especially if you've toiled for a long time. Praise does not pile up. So in a way, you can't get too much. I don't consider it to be a quantity that you can measure by volume.
- It's a wonderful narrative device to bring someone from the outside and look through his eyes if you want to describe the absurdity and preposterous reality that is accepted amongst the ones who are inside.
- I think Stephen Sondheim is a - and I hardly ever use this word - but this is as close as it gets to a genius.
- You get hit over the knuckles enough, you don't stick them out anymore.
- It's a misconception that you don't have seasons in southern California. They are just very subtle. The vegetation is very different. Plants react differently. You just have to be a little more observant.
- I have always been so interested in film as a medium.
- Europeans still believe that working is for living. Americans often have that the other way around.
- Stephen Sondheim I am in awe of.
- I wouldn't really, realistically speaking, know the difference between wearing an S.S. uniform and a U.S. Marine uniform. To me it's all a uniform.
- It took me a lot of times watching it that I started to appreciate 'Pulp Fiction.'
- When a new book comes out or becomes accessible in whatever form, I get it and I read it.
- As a motivation in itself, celebrity is foolhardy and stupid.
- 'The Philadelphia Story' is one of my favorite movies.
- Becoming an actor is like becoming a father. It's not hard to become one. Making a life of it is the challenge.
- I'm open to working anywhere, but not on anything.
- The villain is usually the most interesting part. But it has to be a smart thing. Just dumb cliche villains with a Russian accent and big muscles and a mean face, I don't know. My Russian accent isn't that great, and the muscles aren't that big and the mean face is not enough. You know what I mean? It gets very boring. Tedious stuff.
- Everything that happens later in life is appreciated in a different way. You can appreciate the thing for what it is, which you couldn't if you were 25 and had never experienced much else. You would take it all for granted and think that's what life is like.
- The thing about 'Spectre' is that it is not the work of hack writers. It does not have a hack director. The actors are not hams.
- You can't always do the extraordinary, in between you have to do the ordinary. Because if you didn't, what would constitute the extraordinary?
- Look at ISIS - without the Internet, they wouldn't exist in the same form. The Internet didn't create them, but the Internet facilitates them. And as we know from history, the facilitation is more dangerous than the cause, because the cause can be dealt with, but the facilitation is elusive.
- I am almost neurotically private myself. Because I think it's an important distinction to make between privacy and public sphere.
- I take praise as not just a reward and a result but also as the beginning of a new process.
- A James Bond film can be artistically fulfilling. Absolutely it can. It can be complex, and it can be interesting. I consider Bond movies to be an extension of popular theatre, a kind of modern mythology. You see the same sort of action in 'Punch and Judy' or in the folk theatre of various cultures, like 'Grand Guignol.'
- I think in Europe, movies are made like a commodity and then sold as art.
- I'm very bad with improvisation. I hate it.
- The bohemian artist who exists only for his art, it's a myth. OK, it might have been true for Giacometti, but it certainly wasn't for Picasso or Mozart.
- Well, you need the villain. If you don't have a villain, the good guy can stay home.
- I've always been able to work as an actor and support my family and did great jobs, and more often than not, I got to turn down jobs that I didn't really want to do for various reasons or refuse to work with people I didn't like - and there are quite a few.
- I know from my experience in theater that the crowd is different every night; the reactions, the tension. But it's true for film as well, going from country to country and culture to culture. The difference between California and New York responses, for example. It's really fascinating.
- The fact that Facebook presents facial recognition programmes as a desirable development, well, that in itself is a decisive step toward fascism, as far as I'm concerned.
- It's not the number of trucks parked outside that make a movie interesting but if you have more money, you have more time. More time enables you to try out other possibilities or follow an interesting lead. I don't like indulgence, but to have more possibilities is always more interesting.
- You know, I don't support esoteric approaches to acting.
- It would be completely laughable if I claimed I was always motivated by the pure craft of acting and that recognition doesn't play a part. Of course it does - that's human nature.
- There is no such thing as pure art. It's a bourgeois conceit.
- I'm trying to be very aware of not repeating myself.
- By looking into more details of American history, we can make more sense of what's happening today.
- It's easy to not feel misplaced if this tidal wave of appreciation is coming your way.
- It bothers me that people who should know better believe a glossy magazine fantasy.
- Cary Grant is really the master of not taking himself so seriously.
- I used to hate exposure situations. What is generally referred to as 'red carpet.'
- You're always being cast for what you've been in last.
- For a while, I couldn't decide whether or not I should pursue singing in the opera or acting. And I'm glad that I chose the latter because I wasn't a very good singer.
- You know, I don't talk about the characters that I play. Years ago, I was a little timid about it and I kind of squirmed when I was asked, 'Could you tell us something about your character.' Now with a little self-confidence that comes with the grey beard, I just flatly refuse.
- You see, my version of why anyone would want to become an actor is that it's some psychological fixation, something that happened in puberty that you didn't outgrow in time, which is normal. Nevertheless, if you make it a profession, it can be really neurotic.
- Sometimes I do stuff where people say, 'Why did you do that?' And you know, it's very simple. I do it because I've never done it before.
- I've done so many jobs because I've had to, not because I've wanted to. And it's honourable to do a job because you need to feed your children, and maybe there is also something in it for your development as an actor. But only up to a point.
- Our hubris needs to be downsized, thinking that profiteering on Earth, on whatever level - environmentally, economically, culturally - is unlimited and everybody should get as much as he wants or she wants. Humans need to be shrunk again to their actual size.
- I only do what I like to do.
- The actor is there to translate what's on the page onto the stage or the screen. So I find it important that an actor manages to actually get out of the way, vanish as a person behind the character, never to be seen or talked about again. That's my philosophy.
- I'm not really all that familiar with comic book culture.
- Ten flashing lights are a nuisance but 500 are fantastic.
- My agent is the quickest, sharpest man on earth.
- Something that is very special today might not be special tomorrow, but to hold it, to grasp it, to keep it, to make it special, to elevate it from the ordinary, that's when you open up the champagne. To make it sparkle.
- There is one thing I do miss in L.A. I love autumn.
