- So much of our business is 'What have you done lately?' There is no resting on the laurels.
- I mean, it's very tough, especially on the independent scene, just to sort of stand out, and catch the attention of TNA, of Ring of Honor, of WWE.
- I've done a lot of ladder matches in my career and usually you come out a little more sore than you would in a regular match.
- As the years progress, TNA knew they had something good with the X-Division, then they started building their tag and heavyweight division, and it became one of many good divisions as opposed to the 'stand out' division.
- And so it's sort of a fine line where you want to be recognizable as professional wrestling but you also want to set yourself apart from what some people consider the standard of professional wrestling, which is the WWE.
- When the WWE does well, professional wrestling does well. The WWE is what most people know as professional wrestling.

- I mean, I'm twenty years in the business, I still watch tapes. I still watch matches on Youtube. I'm trying to learn. I watch my old stuff to see what I used to do that worked, that didn't work. You never stop learning.
- Not every pitch I swing at is going over the fence, but you're going to miss every shot you don't take.
- If I wasn't addicted to the idea of performing, I think retiring out of the ring and moving to a backstage position or becoming more of an office guy. That wouldn't bother me so much.
- Once that bell rings, all I can do is perform at the best of my abilities and at the top of my game.
- I grew up in Fayetteville, North Carolina where Fort Bragg is, basically where the Mid Atlantic territories were sort of based out of the Carolinas. So I grew up watching guys like Ric Flair, Dusty Rhodes and the Road Warriors.
- I feel like the X Division, when it first started out, it was the thing that made TNA different than everything else that was on the scene. It was also the thing that brought a lot of the buzz around TNA in the very beginning.
- I'm very interested in keeping my endurance up, my stamina up, I keep my rest periods short and I try to do as much compound movement as i can. Not isolation, but a lot of compound exercises, stuff designed to work the whole the body, to get the full body workout.
- It's cool to see wrestling fans that are also comic book creators sort of put their fandom on the page, and then take that fandom and put it on the screen.
- New Japan, who is on a tear, they're gaining a lot of great United States exposure being on Ring of Honor's television and pay-per-views. I feel like both companies are thriving and surviving and excelling.
- The thing about the Young Bucks is that they've sort of turned their own success into this movement. They don't really follow a format or play by a set of rules, they just go out there and feel everything, so it's hard to gauge a game plan for them.
- I've teamed with AJ Styles, with Matt Sydal, with Donovan Morgan, with Elix Skipper.

- It's all performance and my acting background made me very comfortable in front of people, in front of cameras. It helped me think on my feet in front of a crowd.
- Honestly, I'm sure the WWE's not looking for 47-year old rookies and that's fine with me. The timing of my career worked out where when I might have been interesting to them, were times that I was under contract with TNA or Ring of Honor and that's fine with me.
- Barring wacky nonsense, I'm going to end my career in a Ring of Honor ring. And that to me is fine. It's poetic justice.

- When you're that comfortable with your own product, with your own work rate - so to speak - that's when you become valuable. That's when people start vying for you, to ply your trade in their wrestling match.

- What I do I try different things ahead of time, I don't get stuck in one rut and I don't do the same workout for more than a month at at time.

- I graduated college, my degree is in theatre, so I went to Chicago and tried to get into the theatre scene up there, but it was real hard to break in and find paying work.
- The difference between wrestling in singles and in tags, there's just a different art to it. There's a mentality.
- With syndicated television and broadcast pay-per-view, this is an opportunity for a lot of guys to break into the national mainstream.
- To peel the curtain back, I don't know if I could do Curry Man the same way I did it in TNA and not be racially insensitive.

- I've being doing some stuff overseas. I got the opportunity to go to New Japan a couple of times.
- I've been a comic book fan since I was 10 years old.
- I didn't put a date on what's left in my career. I didn't say by the time I'm 46, or 47, or 48, or by the time I've been in wrestling for 25 years or 26. I just said I was going to keep doing it as long as I could, and as long as I was still having fun.

- There's a pressure to be the wrestler that you are, that character that you've created 24 hours a day 7 days a week. It's tough for wrestlers sometimes to sort of have that separation between person and character.

- And the truth of the matter is sometimes it's hard to be different from the WWE when you're trying to gain those same viewers. Sometimes there's a tendency to sort of follow in the footsteps of the WWE.

- The match with Taka Michinoku for the Light Heavyweight title was in fact my first match with the WWE, but I didn't know about it until I got to the building.
- Ring of Honor has always been about the best wrestling in the world, and by adding the New Japan talent into the game, it's really upped everyone's game.

- I've felt that A.J. Styles has always proven that he's a great in-ring competitor and on the television show.
- There are times when you'll be up in the spotlight at the very top of the show, and you get put back down in the mix because the company is trying to keep everybody fresh and interested, and one guy can't be stuck at the top of the card forever.
- But whether or not I deserved being called 'King of the Indies,' I've wrestled in many promotions across the US because promoters put a lot of credence in that title.
- I feel like with the level of talent that we've got in AEW - there are some fans of mine that would love to see me on 'Dynamite', but the honest truth is, the time to feature me as an act, I feel, is sort of, not long gone, but it's sort of passed, and I'm okay with that.
- Fans that are excited and involved in the action can add an atmosphere that makes wrestling in front of them a great experience.
- I sometimes wonder, the tendency for anybody, especially when you're with friends and you're in the trenches, is to laugh at the stuff that you interpret as ridiculous or silly, and to grouch about the things that you interpret as not being good. That to me isn't morale, that's just like getting through the day.

- When you start to add paraphernalia into a match whether it's a ladder match or a tables match or anything, any of these outside factors, you start to ramp up the intensity and you ramp up the difficulty in these matches.
- I think any company that gives Samoa Joe an opportunity is going to benefit and be happy. I think Joe is a great performer.
- I don't think that there's a burning hunger in the wrestling world to see me necessarily wrestle anybody.

- I do a lot of yoga, it keeps you flexible and you recover from injury quickly and I try to keep my heart rate up the entire time.

- As long as we concentrate on putting out great wrestling, I feel like that's going to benefit us.
- I was very fortunate after I left TNA that Ring of Honor had a position here for me.
- I was never going to become Road Warrior Animal.
- When we started with Ring of Honor, when we started with TNA, there was a very similar mindset that we were building something, that we were doing something good.
- I go back and watch a lot of the stuff that I did back in the day, and it was a lot of wrestling just to show that I could wrestle. And I realized that sort of stuff is sort of pointless.

- As far as the level of success, any step that TNA took, it always felt like it was a small step, but it was a small step forward. I always felt like the smart thing that TNA did was that they never let their reach exceed their grasp, so to speak. They never tried to take on too much at one time.

- When you hear complaints about pro wrestling, it's that there is too much soap opera, too much storyline.
- It's easy to dismiss Cheeseburger. You look at him as a guy who is 5'8, 125 pounds, very inexperienced. I know not to judge a book by it's cover, and if a kid with those dimensions is willing to get in the ring with me and Kazarian, you know his heart is the size of Cleveland.
- Well, I think at this point, having won the championships that I aimed to win in my career, now the opportunities to wrestle different wrestlers is sort of the carrot that is dangling.
