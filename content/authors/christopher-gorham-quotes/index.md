- One of the first times I came to New York was for a modeling and talent competition, IMTA, which I won. I came with a group, like a modeling school from Fresno.
- Talk about songs that make me cry: Track 7 on the 'Phineas and Ferb' soundtrack, 'Summer (Where Do We Begin?).' When you get to the part about sitting with your brother underneath the shade of a big tree in the backyard, ohmygod. Turn on the waterworks.
- I know how to waltz because I used to teach ballroom dancing when I was in high school.
- My wife forever has made fun of my Yanni CD that I had in college.
- I taught at a cotillion. I was one of the teenage helpers when I was in high school. But we're talking very basic.
- I do like to just have football on, so I will TiVo, like, three or four games for the weekend, and I'll just turn it on when there's no live football on, just to have the background noise.

- You know, 'Jake 2.0' had some funny things in it; I mean, I needed my sense of humor to do that part.
- I do abs every day: regular, weighted crunches and sit-ups every other day, then my obliques and my sides on the alternating day. So I'm working my core every day.
- My dirty little secret is that I hate running. I don't like cardio. I also really like food, and all kinds of food - bread, chocolate, all of the yummy stuff. I up my cardio quite a bit and I start cutting out carbs, sugar, and salt just to try to get as lean as I can.
