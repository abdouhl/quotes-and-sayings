- If you're lucky enough to be raised in a rich family, good. But learn how to respect that luck. It's not a given, you know? It's not like, 'Well, it's normal'. No, it's not normal. It's lucky.
- What you've done is done. You've got a goal you never reach, and it's always farther away. It keeps you walking. I don't want to sit down.
- It may be a mistake to say this, but I know my limitations as an actor and I know what I can and can not do. Robert De Niro can do everything. I can't. A 'Highlander' movie is basically my thing. What I'm attempting to do is develop my ability as an actor and try to be the best I can be in the fantasy/action genre.
- Acting is still, of course, what I love to do most. The beauty of it is that by changing characters, it never gets boring.
- I don't need to work.
- The most important thing is to be passionate and ready to accept the pains that sometimes go along with the business.
- Now I don't want to feel cornered as an actor, because I've got a wider range than that.
- To relax, I work.
- If a site is done with pleasure and a fun attitude, it's a great way to communicate with your fans.
- My main place is in Switzerland, but I live on a plane, really.
- I think in some ways it's good to have at least one thing for which you could be really immortal, you know?
- I was always trying, even in pure action movies, to find what was sensitive about the character more than the pure action.
- I wanted to do different movies. I wanted to do deeper movies. More human movies based on human feelings.
- It's not a matter of becoming a superstar. Fame and money aren't the purpose of all this. No actor's going to say, 'I don't want to be famous.' But the main purpose for doing what I'm doing is the passion in the work.
