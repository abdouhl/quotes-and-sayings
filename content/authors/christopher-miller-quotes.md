- Just from a psychological standpoint, it's really helpful having films with a joyful message and positivity, so we try to do that with all our movies, really.
- With a bucket of Lego, you can tell any story. You can build an airplane or a dragon or a pirate ship - it's whatever you can imagine.

- You need to come up with a reason to make a movie, separate from the commercial side.
- There's something that's delightful about things getting bigger and more over-the-top. Sometimes it's empty, and other times, it's just fun.
