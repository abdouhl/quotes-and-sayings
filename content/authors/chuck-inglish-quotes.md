- The Midwest is a musical melting pot and the source and birthplace of several musical genres.
- I'm thinking about recording everything to tape like it's 1991 and seeing how that sounds.
- Grills are how to achieve a great flavor on meats and vegetables. They bring people together. The smell of them getting started is therapeutic.
- I'm not really gonna stop. We've got so much stuff to do, so many songs we talked about, so many things to record.
- I wanted to give 'Droptops' away for free because it doesn't sound like my album. It's way more like a nostalgic Cool Kids sound, but that's me too.
- I want to be a band that people haven't seen.
- Music controls moods and accents life's moments. It's necessary for every situation.
- The Cool Kids are Chicago. Me being from Michigan is a part of that dynamic.
- I'm into emulation, not imitation.
- I think writers just can't come up with any new words for what we're doing, because we're not 'retro-' anything. Like, in 'Gold and a Pager,' we're not talking about what was current - pagers were cool to us, but they never stopped being cool; people just stopped using them.
- Fans are essential in the California heat. The ones with movement keep the air flow active - I need that.
- The '65 Impala is pretty much me as a car.
- A good game will always snatch my attention. No matter the sport, the spirit of competition and audience is nostalgic and relaxing to me.
- I tried to make a 'When Doves Cry' in a rap version. I used a lot of instruments and I broke it down like I thought Prince would do, and that's the song I sent to Big Boi.
- It's just always been a hobby of ours to make music that makes us happy and excites us when we make it.
- Acting and recording an album at the same time, that's not my sport. I could write a movie when my attention was paid to that. But I'm good at one thing at a time.
