- I was lucky to start playing guitar in the Eighties when so many great players were around to inspire me, like Yngwie Malmsteen, Van Halen and especially Dave Murray and Adrian Smith of Iron Maiden.
- At all times, musicians are replaceable. Friends are not.
- Music should not be a contest, it should be an individual thing that each band is putting out from within themselves.
- When I first got involved in the underground metal scene in '82, '83, there were only about five or six major Death or Black Metal bands around. There were so many other bands that were inspirational, that really helped.
- People unfortunately think that if you progress as a musician you are wimpy. I don't get that.
- I try to be positive, and from 'Individual'... which was an angry record. I got a lot of mail from people pouring out their feelings, saying that they could really relate to certain topics that I touched upon. When I read that, it lets know that there are people out there that are people out there who are going through the same things.
- I would like to live forever if it was possible.
- There aren't demons flying around with horns, people are demons.
