- Biographers use historians more than historians use biographers, although there can be two-way traffic - e.g., the ever-growing production of biographies of women is helping to change the general picture of the past presented by historians.
- All the people I have written about remain with me - perhaps they are my closest friends.
- Dickens is a lover of human beings; a relisher of human beings.
- Simon Russell Beale is an incomparable speaker of Shakespeare and a superb all-round actor.
- Dickens is always full of surprises.
- I think it's about as likely Jane Austen was gay as that she was found out to be a man.
- By the time I went up to Cambridge, I was extremely quiet and well behaved, although I now meet people who remember me as not like that at all.
- When you live with Dickens for years, reading him and trying to present him as faithfully as you can, you can't fail to love the man - so the shock of his bad behaviour is considerable, even when you know it is coming.
- I sometimes think that, since I started writing biographies, I've had more of a life in books than I have had in my real life.
- Dickens belongs to the English people.
- The whole world knows Dickens, his London and his characters.

- I continually get more information about a subject after the book has been published.
- I would perhaps like to go back to writing small books about obscure people.

- I would like to have a more social life than I have.
- I was very priggish as a child. I saved up for a book on medieval English nunneries, for which I was despised by my friends.

- When I wrote about Mary Wollstonecraft, I found that here she was, in the late 18th century, going to work for the 'Analytical Review.' What was the 'Analytical Review?' It was a magazine that dealt with politics and literature.
- The thing I love about Rome is that is has so many layers. In it, you can follow anything that interests you: town planning, architecture, churches or culture. It's a city rich in antiquity and early Christian treasures, and just endlessly fascinating. There's nowhere else like it.

- I enjoyed the whole process of learning and was always happy when autumn came and school or college started up again.

- As a young man, Dickens worked as a reporter in the House of Commons and hated it. He felt that all politicians spoke with the same voice.
- Essentially, I spent most of my childhood with my mother and my older sister, and I suppose I had rather a romantic vision of how things might be if there were men around; I saw myself in a country house with six children and a garden. That has never been achieved - and I still regret it.

- 'Philomena' was even better than I had expected. I was so pleased to see the evil Irish nuns thoroughly exposed, and I thought Judi Dench gave a flawless performance, as did everybody else.

- Dickens was a part of how the whole celebration of Christmas as we know it today emerged during the 19th century.

- I think it's quite normal for people to have love affairs.
- In 2007, several musicologists contacted me at about the same time, expressing interest in the work of the mysterious Muriel Herbert, a few of whose songs they had come across.
- 'A Christmas Carol' has been described as the most perfect of Dickens's works and as a quintessential heart-warming story, and it is certainly the most popular.

- If I'm in a state about a book, I'll get up at 6 A.M. and write before breakfast, but usually I'll start afterwards and then work a full day with a break for lunch.
- You become more tolerant when you become older. You're not interested in rapping people over the knuckles; you're interested in understanding them.
- Dickens was very practical and sensible.
- All writers behave badly. All people behave badly.

- I always feel sad when I come to the end of a book.
- I had forgotten until I looked up old notes that I sold the film rights of my first book, a life of Mary Wollstonecraft: there was a lunch, a contract, a small sum of money, then nothing.
- I belong to the Richmond Concert Society, who put on very good concerts.
- In 1843, everybody was hungry, unemployed, and conditions were very bad.
- Why do we read biography? Why do we choose to write it? Because we are human beings, programmed to be curious about other human beings, and to experience something of their lives. This has always been so - look at the Bible, crammed with biographies, very popular reading.
- When dealing with a subject who is dead, you have this feeling of being God. You know who they're going to marry, when they're going to die. It's strange to feel so omniscient.

- I'm interested in history, in trying to relate the past to the present and to understand how people thought about their problems and pleasures.
- After Shakespeare, Dickens is the great creator of characters, multiple characters.
- I was working at the 'Evening Standard' when I heard that there was a job going as deputy literary editor on the 'New Statesman.' I remember thinking, 'That's perfect.' It was three days a week, and I had children, but I could make that work - so I applied for it and got it.
- Biographies are, in their nature, far more difficult to make into films than novels, because novels come with plots constructed and dialogue written, whereas I don't invent dialogue for my subjects or plot their lives for them.
- Biographers search for traces, for evidence of activity, for signs of movement, for letters, for diaries, for photographs.
- The young Dickens was so alive, so self-confident, so funny.
- It's a difficult thing to lose a child, a grown-up child.
- Historians will handle a much wider range of sources than a biographer and will be covering a broader spectrum of events, time, peoples.
- Everyone finds their own version of Charles Dickens. The child-victim, the irrepressibly ambitious young man, the reporter, the demonic worker, the tireless walker. The radical, the protector of orphans, helper of the needy, man of good works, the republican. The hater and the lover of America. The giver of parties, the magician, the traveler.

- Dickens had more energy than anyone in the world, and he expected his sons to be like him, and they couldn't be.
- Poetry was one of the things that interested me most as I was growing up. I used to write it in my head all the time. I still think the very greatest pleasure in life is to write a poem.
- One of my most vivid memories of the mid-1950s is of crying into a washbasin full of soapy grey baby clothes - there were no washing machines - while my handsome and adored husband was off playing football in the park on Sunday morning with all the delightful young men who had been friends to both of us at Cambridge three years earlier.
