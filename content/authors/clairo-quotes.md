- It's really weird being placed into something like that because it was never an intention to make bedroom pop. I was just making music. All the people that have that genre placed on them are not the first people to have a home studio and and post it on the Internet.
- My teacher wanted me to do 'Hot Cross Buns,' but all I wanted to learn was 'Island in the Sun' by Weezer.
- I make a point to tweet out really funny comments I get on YouTube videos. I have the most ridiculous ones.
- Before 'Pretty Girl' was released, I didn't really talk about my YouTube channel or show anyone. I didn't expect any of my videos to blow up like 'Pretty Girl' did.
- I'm someone that needs to talk about my problems. I call my mom every single day at school just to vent about random stuff. Singing is the same thing.
- YouTube was always a secret space for me. I'd randomly post videos of me singing with guitar, or sometimes I'd post some half-finished film projects I'd made.
- It's crazy to feel like you have to sell yourself and just, like, be almost... marketable. I'd never thought of it that way.
- I remember the first album I really completely geeked out over was The Shins' 'Wincing The Night Away.' That album was everything to me.
- Making music has always made me happy. When I go through a situation, the best way for me to get over it is to bundle up all of my emotions about it, put it in a little shell, create something, and then let it go.
- My live show experience has not been good. It's just because I haven't had a band or anything. I played a show in Santa Ana that I'm just not proud of at all. It came out of the blue, and I kind of freaked out and took the opportunity because it was the biggest thing I've ever been offered.
- My stuff gets in a lot of vaporwave Facebook groups for some reason.
- I had moved around my whole life. That was the one thing that was always so hard.
- I'm a producer at heart.
- I bought this Oxygen midi synth from a flea market in Boston for $10. And then I found a cord in my house that fit it, and so I just started using that to do synth stuff in GarageBand.
- My friends started making music, and then I started making covers because I was like, 'I don't have anything to write, but I like music.' So I would just cover Frank Ocean songs.
- I've always wanted to be a PC Music girl, like Hannah Diamond or SOPHIE.
- I think my parents are the first influence on me music-wise. My dad was into Motown and soul, and my mom was into British '80s pop, like The Trashcan Sinatras. I grew up on that. It was great. They were the first people to really bring music into my life.
- I want everyone who's listening to know who I am and not just see me as this singer. I want them to feel connected to my story.
- At the end of the day, when people say, 'Oh, she's an industry plant,' I'm like, 'No, I just have representation, like every single other artist you listen to.' I'm not the first person to get a manager.
- The fact that there has to be a man behind my success when I genuinely have worked so hard is frustrating.
- I was like this weird, edgy 10-year-old. I was figuring out who I was, obviously at the worst time. I had braces and bangs, and it was a nightmare.
- I'm still writing from personal experiences, which is what people connected with in the first place.
- 'Better' is one of the first real steps I've made into 'pop music,' and this collab feels like a match made in Heaven!
- I never want to be one of those artists who feels untouchable and extraordinary. I have to be genuine.
- It keeps me from getting too overwhelmed about the industry when I can just do my math homework.
- I'm still not entirely sure how 'Pretty Girl' blew up the way it did. It wasn't really meant to. The song was originally meant for a compilation tape for a magazine called 'The Le Sigh', and I made the video in about 30 minutes.
- I felt like I needed to be a 'pretty girl' for someone else. I felt like I needed to change a lot about who I actually was to be perfect for them instead of just being who I am genuinely.
- We all kind of dreamed about being musicians, but the narrative around being a musician is it'll never happen to you. It's not something that just happens - one in a million shot - all those things that just make you feel like it'll never happen.
- When you're just making something in your room, you're not thinking that this box with a screen is gonna make you famous. You don't think you're putting yourself out there, because you don't see it on the other side.
