- I'm trying to let winning the world championships settle in right now before I begin training again shortly. During the skating season, we skate on average 20 kilometres a day. On top of that, we're riding a lot and lifting a lot of weights.
- I've learned what it truly means to be Canadian and in turn I've been inspired to make a difference in the world, however small it's been.
- I'll skate on concrete if I have to. I'm not worried about how fast the ice is. I'm worried about how fast I can go on the ice.
- My goal is to try to avoid a regular job.
- The struggle I went through has value.
- I have this thing I say to myself that 'tomorrow can be better.' And I remember that period in my life where I never felt like tomorrow could be better. It was always dread for the next day.
