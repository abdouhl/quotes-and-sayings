- You need to make mistakes in rehearsal because that's how you find out what works and what doesn't.
- I'm a stage actor, and we never get to see our performances.
- My first professional acting job was in 'Hair' during the Vietnam War. So I think I've always been drawn to projects with a social conscience.
- I first came to London as a musician, and when my group broke up, I did 'Guys and Dolls' at the Watford Palace theatre. After that, Ned Sherrin found me and brought me to the West End to do one of his shows. The work went from strength to strength, so I thought: 'This is where the world wants me; I'll stay.'
- I don't like being away from theater that long. The muscles get atrophied if you don't exercise them.
- Our points of reference in America aren't steeped in literature; they're steeped in that five minutes between commercials.
- I like rock music. I like jazz better, though.
- Some film actors want to sit back and look at every scene and all that crap. No, you're an actor - tell the story, and when it's told, there's another one to tell.
