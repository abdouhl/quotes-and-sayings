- You have to accept the fact that sometimes you are the pigeon, and sometimes you are the statue.
- You make a film to distract people, to interest them, perhaps to make them think, perhaps to help them be a little less naive, a little better than they were.
- Stupidity is infinitely more fascinating that intelligence. Intelligence has its limits while stupidity has none.
- As far as I was concerned, either I was a homosexual or I wasn't, so making films would change nothing.
