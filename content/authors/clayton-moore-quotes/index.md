- Once I got the Lone Ranger role, I didn't want any other.
- I often meet adults in their 30s, 40s, or 50s who, as soon as they recognize me, suddenly become six years old again.

- I am a fighter. I believe in that which is right, and the truth is, I have been the Lone Ranger for the past thirty years and I will not give up the fight. I love my public and I'll fight for you. I'll continue to make personal appearances for my thousands of fans.
