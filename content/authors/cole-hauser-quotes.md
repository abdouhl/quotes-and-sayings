- I definitely don't generalize and put everybody in the same cup of water.
- It's always fun to play someone like an action hero that you always wanted to play as a child. I think every young boy loves that as a kid.
- Initially, I got into the business to do drama. I never really thought I would be doing sci-fi films.
- My belief is that if I can achieve that level of entertainment by making the audience happy or sad or angry, then I have succeeded as an actor and have done my job. The profits and the fame as an actor will eventually surface, but first and foremost comes the work as an actor.

- I haven't really had any experiences, as far as having paparazzi sit outside of my house or following me around on the street. But, I actually don't really go to places where they do that, unless they knew where I lived or what kind of car I drive.
- I grew up watching Marlon Brando, Christopher Walken, Robert de Niro, and Al Pacino and even Robert Duvall and was impressed by their caliber of work.
