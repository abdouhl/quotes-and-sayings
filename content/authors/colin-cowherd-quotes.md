- I don't mind long, extended trips to warm weather destinations.
- A sports writer who covers baseball could go up to Tony La Russa and have a real baseball argument, and Tony would listen and it would seem reasonable.
- Tom Brady is aspirational. He married a supermodel. He's creating a global brand. He has houses in Costa Rica, Montana. Tom's always been about growth and evolving. That's not Boston.

- All-Star games don't resonate with me.
- This radio business I'm in is full of guys who read the sports page and rip crap off.

- Parlays are for suckers and college kids.

- The culture at ESPN, I found when I left, isn't the same as when I came. It wasn't as much fun.
- Strong families equal strong leaders.
- It's baseball. You don't think a general manager can manage? Like it's impossible? The game is too complex? I've never bought into that, 'Baseball's just too complex.' Really? A third of the sport is from the Dominican Republic.
- My parenting philosophy pretty much boils down to this: I love my kids; I tolerate yours. Mine just make common, age-appropriate mistakes - phases, let's call them - while your kids are completely undisciplined and probably need counseling.

- Leadership is IQ, it's not skills.

- You have to know what you are and what you're not. And I'm not a politico.
- Big game? I'll take Cam Newton over Aaron Rodgers.
- A lot of these coaches, they're almost like military leaders, and the media is the enemy. Football coaches are just wired tight.
- We're in an on-demand world. You can do real-time commentary now with no barriers. I don't have to drive to a studio, don't have to put makeup on. I don't have to go to a studio and get miked up.
- I think you have to constantly challenge your staff. I have to challenge myself; you get more interesting answers that way.
- Andy Reid really dominated the NFC with Donovan McNabb as his best quarterback, got to a Super Bowl. Then he goes to the AFC, wins with Alex Smith. He's won with five or six quarterbacks.
- I try to broaden every discussion out, make it very relatable to fans.
- I can't control myself. I wish I could. I've gone to parties, I've gone to games, and I drive home and think, 'God, can't you just not argue for once? Can't you just take what people give you and be happy with their answer?'
- Sometimes my tone stinks.
- It's amazing what good coaching can do to a team.
- Here's something that's interesting if you look at basic metrics or numbers in this country - 71% of African-American men: no dad at home. No disciplinarian. Fathers are often the louder voice, the disciplinarian. Many of those kids don't grow up with a dad.

- The demographics of this country are changing. And the people coming to this country are soccer fans, not hockey fans.
- Hockey is no longer a big four. It's football, basketball, baseball and soccer. Now, I'm not talking MLS. I'm talking COPA, World Cup, men's, women's, MLS, youth... and there's a lot of reasons for it.
- I think when you host a radio show, just like Jon Stewart hosts a show, I think sometimes I bring up stuff... that makes people cringe.

- Twitter has created a certain momentum that is not always fact-based. I worry about that because I still live in a world where you need to have two sources.
- Well, I came from a small little town on the beach - Grayland, a town of about 1,000 people. I was the quarterback and a basketball player at Ocosta High School. It was a great community to grow up in.

- There's not a single NFL writer in the country who could diagram a play for Bill Belichick.
- I really latched on to announcers who were good storytellers.
- Tom Brady is fun and happy. Boston is cranky and intense.
- If you look at women in sports, they generally have to be more qualified because it is kind of a man's world. Guys will give guys a lot more breaks than a woman. I'd argue that women make fewer mistakes and are held to a higher standard. I think the ultimate respect you can pay to a woman in my business is you're my equal.
- I don't think that doing things a certain way because they've always been done that way is smart. I don't think you grow that way.
- I hurt people with my words and I regret that.
- Baseball is like any sport. It's mostly instincts.
- You know, John Wall and Vick are very similar. I'm not disputing their talent. I mean, Michael Vick and John Wall are fun to watch. But building my franchise around him, leadership position?
- Defense wins at every level.
- I want to be funny and interesting and compelling.
- New York is a highly educated city. People who are educated generally go to college. People who go to college who are men love college football.
- Listen, when John Wall came out and did the Dougie, first home game, for 34 seconds, he was a moron. It's the dumbest thing I've ever seen. I will never back down.
- Bob Rondeau - he'll never know this - but he was so instrumental. He is a legend to me and had a major impact in my life.

- Disney hovers over every decision at ESPN.
- I've never been a big fan of Cam Newton's.
- Most announcers over talk. I'm in the opinion space so I talk all day, but play-by-play guys generally over talk.
- I have never really had any ugly confrontations, other than Bobby Knight, and that was before I was doing sports talk radio. He is just a very difficult guy.
- I want to create this really smart, thoughtful podcast network where I do for young people what somebody did for me.
- I try to be honest and work hard. That's the only two things I worry about.
- From a small market, nobody had heard of me. ESPN had guts, they had courage, they rolled the dice. A guy flew into Portland, we got a rare snowstorm, he was stuck there four days, John McConnell listened to me, and he recommended me.
- If I am ever forced to cover guys playing video games, I will retire and move to a rural fishing village and sell bait.
- To me, radio is about making you uncomfortable. Television is about making you comfortable: Who do you like? Who do you want to be friends with? So I don't need to tower over people in television.
- The NFL is one of the first places where many star players finally see discipline. Finally have an authoritative male figure: Buck stops here, I make all the calls, you will not get an opinion.
- Sean Taylor, great player has a history of really really bad judgment, really really bad judgment.
- Wild card teams usually have some flaws or they wouldn't be one.

- Troy Aikman has always felt like a Dallas Cowboy to me.
- Tom Brady is the two best quarterbacks of all time.

- I'm not angry. I like to laugh.
- Soccer has surpassed, in this country, hockey.
- Deep down, I want to be liked, but in the end, I'm willing to argue. Is it because I'm seeking attention? I don't have the answers to that.
- I'm in the opinion business.
- I am not a friend of eSports. It's the same with professional wrestling - it's for booger eaters.
- Bob Rondeau was a seminal voice in my young broadcasting career. The two people that I really monitored were Vin Scully and Bob Rondeau. And they both had an amazing talent. They were word efficient.
- Got to be honest, I don't think much of anybody that tatoos themselves several times.
- When I poked Baker Mayfield in the ribs - police video, height - poked him in the ribs, kind of a reach. Oh, it bothered him. He fired back every time. Every time. Because Baker was not ready to go from best college team to lousy NFL team. That's a certain level maturity and self-esteem that few have.
- Political radio is often angry.
- People ask me, 'What's it like to leave ESPN?' and I say, 'I'm not leaving ESPN. I'm leaving ESPNU.' That's what I was on. That network doesn't even have a sales staff.
- Point guard is like the quarterback. It's an IQ-judgment position. The great ones are not about themselves. They're about the others.
