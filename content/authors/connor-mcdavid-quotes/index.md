- There are certain things you can say off the ice, but I think it's mostly on the ice.

- If you're putting the puck in an awkward place for someone, that's right away, advantage: you.
- I love the game so much and I work hard at it and I have a lot of fun with it.
- I think the main thing, you only get one career and you need to make the most money that you can, and any player will tell you that, you need to take care of yourself and look after yourself and your family and those around you.
- Scoring isn't the only thing in this game.
- I'm definitely not one of those guys that's chirping the guys that dress super nice, because you know, there's guys out there in the league - and on my team in fact - that have great style. And I'm just like, 'go for it, man, you look good!'
- I definitely believe in myself. And I don't need to show that on the outside. I just don't feel like I need to tell people how I feel about myself. I know my skills and I know what I'm comfortable in, and I keep it to myself.
- I take a lot of naps.
- If you're starting to lose the love of the game, it means you're not going to work as hard.

- I've always said I want to score more.
- One season doesn't make a career.
- I used to get shadowed when I was 8 years old. Really early.
- We definitely do a lot of tip drills at practice and try to work on your hand-eye coordination and stuff like that.
- Every year is a new year, and when you look at the turnover year to year, teams that made the playoffs last year aren't a guarantee to make the playoffs this year.
- I think the fans want to see offense.
- I've been lucky to be surrounded by some good hockey minds.
- Honestly, I felt pressure more when I was a lot younger.
- At the end of the day, it is hockey. It's the same game, the rules don't change. It's the same hockey game I've been playing since I was 2 years old. I think you can kind of rely on that.
- You look at all the elite players around the League, the guys that are responsible defensively, the guys that can score at will, they kind of do it all.

- It's a weird league in the sense that sometimes you get goals when they definitely shouldn't have gone in, and sometimes you're doing everything right and it's just not going in. It's the way it goes. I think every player who's ever played in this league has gone through it.
- When you're a rookie, sometimes your voice is not really heard.

- It's insane to really think about, someone is going to pay me $100 million to do what I would do anyway on a regular day; it's insane.
- I think I'm a guy that can relate to everyone and is fairly close with everyone on the team and can try to help bring guys together. That's what I tried to focus on when I was in Erie and I felt everyone was a part of the team. I definitely try to lead that way; I'm not the big rah-rah guy.
- I think when I first came into the League, I was blowing the zone all the time, just kind of expecting pucks to get out. You learn very quickly that you can't be doing that.
- Obviously as a kid you collect hockey cards.
