- To come home and have three songs working on radio, I can't tell you how happy I am. It is amazing.
- I don't think I'll ever be a person who likes to work out.
- Traveling a lot and touring, you're in and out of hotels, and you don't have any comforts around.
- Nineties music was what I grew up with, and I want to make music that's soulful but that you can also dance and drive to.
- My grandfather was like Australia's Tom Jones.
- Once we played for the Princess of Monaco in Paris. We were the biggest ducks ever, wearing rented tuxedos. We trashed the party, took a bunch of girls and champagne in limos underneath the Eiffel Tower, and set up an acoustic show. It was like a Hilary Duff movie.
- I'm not trying to say I'm this artist who is all artsy and that I only write music for myself, because I don't. I write music for other people to enjoy, so I think about if it'd be an idea someone else would like.
- Even though I am signed to an American label, I want Australia to fall in love with my music because if it doesn't work here, it won't work anywhere.
- I knew I wanted to do music at eight years of age. I listened to a lot of Motown growing up, and it got to the point where I started mimicking people - Michael Jackson or whoever. People started to notice I could hold a tone. The bug was always there.
- I think videos are really hard. I'm yet to be happy with a video. It's very weird watching yourself on camera, which I guess I'm going to have to get used to. I love the thought of being in them, but it's one thing to say that and another to actually do it.
- I want to be remembered as a great performer.
- The Hiltons know how to put on a good wedding, that's all I can say.
- I want to touch people with the music and help them through whatever they're going through. That's what music's there for - making people happy.
- You have those songs that are very special to you that you don't want to get ruined by production. Something like 'Start Again' shouldn't be touched. It's a classic-sounding song on a piano and violins and harmonies, and I think those songs are perfect as they are.
