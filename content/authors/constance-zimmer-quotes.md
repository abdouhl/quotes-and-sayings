- Being on 'House of Cards' really has given me so much more than just a job; the interactions I have had with real White House correspondents, other journalists and bloggers relating to my character Janine - and their thanking me for representing them - has been extraordinary.
- I'm kind of a 'Daily Show,' Bill Maher junkie. I listen to NPR and I still get the 'New York Times' paper delivered to my door, even though I live in L.A.
- In politics, they play games. In Hollywood, they play games. I think that, overall, everybody is trying to do whatever it takes to get ahead.

- You look at Kerry Washington on 'Scandal,' and a lot of the women on that show in general are very strong, and I think we're seeing it more, and I'm excited because when I was doing Dana Gordon on 'Entourage,' there weren't a lot of strong female characters, which is why I think she came out as such a standout character.

- When 'Entourage' came out, there wasn't Twitter or any of this access to celebrities. 'Entourage,' for me, let you inside of a world that nobody really knew about.
- I have the Muji pen that has different colors. My daughter loves to play hangman, or we draw. It's important you can draw a rainbow at all times.

- On my first day on the set of 'Boston Legal,' I thought the director was calling me 'Candice' instead of 'Constance.' But I didn't realize he was actually talking to Candice Bergen.
