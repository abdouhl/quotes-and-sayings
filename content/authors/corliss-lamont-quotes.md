- Most men, I am convinced, have an unmistakable feeling at the final moment of significant choice that they are making a free decision, that they can really decide which one of two or more roads to follow.
- True freedom is the capacity for acting according to one's true character, to be altogether one's self, to be self-determined and not subject to outside coercion.
- The intuition of free will gives us the truth.
- Intuition does not in itself amount to knowledge, yet cannot be disregarded by philosophers and psychologists.
- The act of willing this or that, of choosing among various courses of conduct, is central in the realm of ethics.
- Human beings and their actions constitute the advancing front, the surging crest of an ongoing movement that never stops.
- The cause-effect sequences in our brains are just as determining, just as inescapable, as anywhere else in Nature.
- I believe firmly that in making ethical decisions, man has the prerogative of true freedom of choice.
- The dynamic, creative present, however conditioned and restricted by the effects of prior presents, possesses genuine initiative.
