- I'm not a technology person.
- It wasn't until I found my tribe of artists - people who were outspoken and not afraid to say what they thought, whether in a song or a dance or a piece of classical music - that I found a refuge.
- I'm in a long-term relationship with Diego Serrano, and I'm very happy. He's the worst influence that I have ever had in my life, and I love him for it.
- I'm not on Facebook. I'm not on Twitter. I know a lot of celebrities who go around complaining how little privacy they have. And then my question to that is always, 'Well, how much of yourself are you putting out there?'
- I came to the States when I was ten, and that was, in many ways, very hard.
- I believe that a lot of what we put in our bodies really can harm us. It's been proven that people who eat Mediterranean and Japanese diets live for a very long time.
- I think if education was celebrated in pop culture, we'd live in a better place.
- My priority is to hang out with the ones I love - my family, my loved ones.

- I actually speak fluent English and Spanish and... I dabble in a couple of languages, but I'm not fluent in German, Russian and Arabic.

- I love being at home, having friends over.
- I love the Discovery Channel. I love all sorts of medical shows. I love a show called 'Diagnosis: Unknown.'
- I'm not on Facebook. I'm not on Twitter. I know a lot of celebrities who go around complaining how little privacy they have.
- Cancer runs in our family. I lost my grandmother to it. There's a saying that you meet people and instantly know them. My grandmother and I had that. The first time my heart was broken was when my grandmother passed away. I was twenty-one.
- My mom has a rare talent for being able to open up the refrigerator, and with the peas, the leftover eggs, the cream, the spinach, the cheese, and a little rice, she can just whip up incredible risotto.
- I like to be grounded by nature, go hiking... go to an isolated island that's not glamorous and touristy at all.
- I have to take care of myself because if you get sick, you still have to work. I'm not much a party animal, anyway. I lay low.
- I love the Discovery Channel. I love all sorts of medical shows.
- Coming from the theater, I love the adrenalin rush from working on 'NCIS.' You get home and you're exhausted, but you feel like you've really worked.
- Leaving 'NCIS' was not planned, so there is no plan. If I were panicking now, it would defeat the purpose.
- I have to have eight hours a night. I feel that everything falls apart if you don't sleep. If I spend four hours memorizing dialogue but don't sleep, then the next day I will not be able to stand in front of the camera and say my lines. For me, sleep is the number one thing.
