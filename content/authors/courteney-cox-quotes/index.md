- At one point my dad called me and said, 'You have always been a great salesman. I think it's time you come home and sell swimming pools.'
- I've got some great guy friends. They can start out as crushes. But when you realize something isn't going to happen, you make a choice whether or not the friendship is worth it. And it usually is. Then you can laugh about the fact that you used to have a crush on him or he had one on you.

- I just am a snob when it comes to humor.
- As you get older, you find that everything looks better more natural!
- Oh, I do get lonely, yes.
- I don't like venison or sushi - I don't want to eat what some people think are 'luxurious' foods.
- I hate shopping.
- It's funny, because I never think of myself as Little Miss All-Together.
- Is marriage for ever? I think you get married with the intention that it will be, but who knows?
- I have a lot of glass in my house, and I remember saying as a joke once that I clean my stuff with Windex while my friends are over, but then I found myself actually doing that the other day. It's horrible.

- I think it's hard, the fact that there's a certain age that we can't have kids anymore.
- Sometimes I use Botox. Compared to most, I use it very sparingly. One time I did too much, though. I feel weird if I can't move my face, and that one time I overdid it, I felt trapped in my own skin.

- I'm not fake in any way.
- I'm kind of all over the place, and I need grounding.

- Botox? I think it's fantastic and also horrible.
- A lot of times people say, 'As soon as you relax you'll have a kid.'
- I don't use a lint brush or anything, and I don't iron, but I could easily pick lint off of someone else.

- I don't like to go out in general.

- I don't want to feel I'm responsible for anorexia across the country.
- I like TV. It all depends what it is.
- It's so easy to grow apart; marriage takes work.

- I'm not great at small talk.
- I don't think I'm too thin at all. I understand when people say, 'Well your face gets gaunt,' but to get your bottom half to be the right size, your face might have to be a little gaunt. You choose your battles.
- When I was a kid I didn't feel like I fit in because - this is really silly and I probably shouldn't say it, but, I didn't think anything was funny. So I used to go home and literally cry to my mom and my step-dad at the time and I didn't think anything was funny. I couldn't laugh.
- I'm not a big clothes person.

- I'm at peace with myself and where I am. In the past, I was always looking to see how everybody else was doing. I wasn't competitive, I was comparative. I just wanted to be where everybody else was. Now I've gotten to an age when I am not comparing anymore.
- The questions I'm asking myself are, 'What makes me happy? Where do I want to be? What will make me happy at 50, 60 and 70?'
- I don't think I would ever quit acting, but there are other things I am interested in. I wanted to be an architect, and I wish I knew more about landscaping.
