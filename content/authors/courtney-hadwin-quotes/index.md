- I've had some messages from some famous people which have been so unreal that they know who I am. I had support from Paloma Faith, Luke Evans, Stevie van Zandt, Jojo Siwa and Sharon Stone. It was amazing that so many big names had been talking about me.
- People know who I am now and what I can do, and it's all thanks to 'AGT'. It was never about winning for me. I just love to perform, and that's it really.
- I haven't really thought about winning 'AGT'. I just think that I should be in the competition to have fun, and whatever happens happens for a reason.
- I think the stage is the place where I feel most comfortable and most myself.
- With 'AGT' I was allowed more freedom to be myself. It was also quite a different scale.
- I'm hoping to work on some original songs and to keep performing in front of a crowd as much as I can.
- From 'America's Got Talent' I've learned to not look at all the bad comments and just concentrate on the positive.
- I like the music that I sing, cos I, like, feel it more.
- When I hear music, I come alive. I feel electrified. I just get into the music and I start moving.
- I'm just happy and proud for what I've done, and for coming in the Top 10 of 'America's Got Talent.'
- The 'Voice Kids U.K.' songs were chosen for me, and I had to try and make them mine.
- I'm just a normal teenage kid.
- I just watched a James Brown video of him singing 'I Feel Good,' and then I kind of just copied off his moves. But I couldn't do them properly, so they turned into my own moves.
- My first favourite moment in 'AGT' was getting the golden buzzer from Howie Mandel.
- Growing up, I've always wanted to be a rock star.
- The 'Voice Kids U.K.' was great, but it wasn't a big show like 'AGT.'
