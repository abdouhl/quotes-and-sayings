- If Scotland and America go to war, I'm afraid I've already sworn in.
- I'm a terrible interviewer. I'm not a journalist - although I have a Peabody Award - and I'm not really a late-night host. What I am is honest.

- Other than the laws of physics, rules have never really worked out for me.
- I proved to my own satisfaction that I am madder than I think.
- For me, comedy should have a certain amount of joy in it. It should be about attacking the powerful - the politicians, the Trumps, the blowhards - going after them. We shouldn't be attacking the vulnerable.
- It's not that we fly by the seat of our pants. We're not afraid of failure.
- I used to psych myself up before the show and now I do the complete opposite: I psych myself down. It's 12:30 at night, you don't want some guy yelling at you. You want some guy just talking to you.

- I do a show. It comes on late at night on TV. And if that means I'm a late-night talk show host, then I guess I am, but in every other regard I resign my commission, I don't care for it.
- Why do people do things that they fear? It may be that the fear contains information. Something can be interesting if you get to the other side of that fear.

- I am probably a pseudo-intellectual.
- Late night is no different than making a film, really, except that it's faster, and if you do a crap one, you can do a better one tomorrow. Writing a novel and doing stand-up - that stuff is very similar.

- I have to do a show which is of interest to me, or else I'm lost.

I was - I hate to say the word humbled - but that's what it felt like. I was wrong about this place. This is a great place full of very fun people.
- I said that the only way I could have a band that would work in the format of my show is if the band were crap. So if I have a band they'd have to really suck.
- I'm careful with money.
- I used to believe, like many people who come from poor backgrounds, that it gave me an edge, but I think that's just something we have to tell ourselves to get by sometimes. I don't believe that anymore. Children of privilege can be just as talented and clever as anybody else.
- I remember talking to someone early on after I was sober about how I suddenly felt awkward at parties. They said, 'Well, you're supposed to. Everyone feels awkward at parties.' It's an appropriate feeling to feel.

- I'm reading a book, because I'm brainy. No, it is a book - if you don't know, it is like a blog except bigger.

- I hope what I do has an art to it, and as an artist you have to try new things and keep yourself entertained.
- I always wanted to make motion pictures, ever since I was a wee boy, and I was 32, and time was marching on. I met a guy who said, 'Come out to Hollywood for 10 days, and I'll get you a deal.' So I figured, 'OK, 10 days.' On the 10th day, he got me a development deal with Disney, not for a lot of money, but it allowed me to make the move.

- HD doesn't mean anything to me. It's a technical thing. It's like demographics. A lot of people know about it.

- A friend of mine that I was in a band with started me on Kafka, which in turn led to Camus and Sartre.

- I came to America, and I made good. It's an old story, but it hasn't been told in a long time. Usually, it's, 'I'm an immigrant, I came here and got persecuted.' My story is I came here, I worked hard, and it worked out all right. So it's still available.

- I've been running my whole life. Running into bars, running around the world. But when you have a child, you can't run. That was a revelation.
