- If you really have a passion for something, you should follow it and listen to your inner voice.
- I'm not saying the persona on 'Strictly' isn't me - it's just that the nurturing side, which is also a part of who I am, isn't what I'm there for. I'm there to judge and to give an honest opinion, even if it's not the opinion someone wants to hear.
