- I would probably go so far as to say that I couldn't act before I met Richard Ayoade.
- I want to do comedy films, serious films - I admire the actors who fly under the radar but get loads done, pop up in a lot of good films.
- I'm a pretty big Ricky Gervais fan.
- The 'Being Human' people were really cool and let me improvise. They had such a good working atmosphere. It was a cool set-up and a really good environment to be in.
- I'd love to pop back into 'Being Human' as Adam. I love the character so much. I've never really played a character like that. I'm always playing the geek, so to play a kid who is very energetic when he wants to be, and who is always trying to get the girls, was really cool.
- I have, like, two best friends, one that I grew up with who's not an actor, and one that is an actor that lives near me in Wales, and they're my friends. I don't have any other friends, really, in the industry. I have acquaintances and people that I will go out for coffee with.
- I'm getting a lot of stick because my character in 'Young Dracula' wanted to be vampire, so now that I am a vampire, everyone's like, 'You finally did it!' But it's cool and I loved doing 'Young Dracula.' That show's finished and I don't know why it ended, so it was brilliant to go into 'Being Human,' which is like the adult version of it.
- I've done four other films since 'Submarine,' so that's quite cool. It's just good to have people respect your work; I've never had that before. Yeah, my life has changed crazy. I'm a kid from a small town in south Wales, I play my Xbox usually and all that sort of stuff, and it's a whole new world.
- I'd done kids' TV in the U.K., but not great kids' TV. So yes, 'Submarine' was the first film and the first good thing that I have done.
- I never wanted to be an actor until about three years ago when I realised it was what I liked doing.
- I now hate actors that blink too much on screen. When people blink, I turn the movie off. So I don't blink at all.
- You have to promote yourself; you have to have this smile on your face all the time and be this nice guy - which I am!
