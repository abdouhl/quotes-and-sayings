- I hear a lot of girls say, 'I can be myself around you,' and I'm always thinking, 'Who are you when you're with somebody else?'
- If you're going to be the lead, you better be ready to always be working.
- Coming up with comedy is hard, man. Those bits aren't easy to think of!
- I grew up on the South Side of Chicago, north Beverly. It was cool, everybody's cool on the block.
- The end of 2016, Mariah Carey got on stage, and it was mean. The technical difficulties that she came across, now everybody think that she was lost.
- I've seen some beyond-amazing performers do karaoke who should be on stage somewhere, and I've seen people who you rather didn't enter the bar. That's the beautiful thing about it; it's for everybody.
- I think Carrot Top is hilarious.
- I was in my early twenties. I was 22-ish. I graduated from college and went right into teaching. The first year, I taught in Indiana at a couple schools, and then I moved over to Chicago.
- I'm Mr. Grits. One of the non-perishables.
- 'Peeples' is definitely not 'Meet the Parents'. It's more a movie about family secrets. It does explore class issues somewhat, but it's mostly about living your own truth.
- I have done my share of karaoke. There is a karaoke place right around the corner from me, and I have been there maybe 800 of 1,000 days I've been in L.A. A lot of songs I know now because of that place. I dig karaoke and have fun with it.
- That's when I'm at my rawest. When I'm performing with the band. It's just like the groove is going, whether we're fast or slow, I can just transport myself.
- My parents did the whole good-cop/bad-cop thing - Dad was the bad cop, and Mom was the good cop. I remember my father saying, 'I'm his father, not his friend.' That kind of stuck with me.
- Being on 'The Office' prepared me for drama. Comedy got me ready, but once you get down to it, they're two sides of the same thing. I mean, the delivery has to be different - in drama, there's more time to breathe, and comedy's all about hitting the joke.
- I'm a performer. I do comedy and music, and I blend them together. My band is 'Nasty Delicious!'.
- Jason Behr and Amanda Brooks were cool to work with. Jason and I are fast friends to this day.
- My first time in Germany. We started off in Heidelberg, which is this quaint, nice town. The Germans, they shoot just like the Americans, except for, if it's a 10-hour day, they're leaving at 5. You don't go to 5:30, 6, 7. No. And then we had a fest for everything.
- People do ask me for advice for some reason. And I'll just kind of pose it back to them and let them answer on their own. I never like to give my advice 'cause I don't want them to come back and 'You were wrong! You ruined my life!' so it's more about 'Hey, this is what you just told me. What does that sound like to you?'
- I do - I do enjoy a good rom-com here and there. Would 'A Fish Called Wanda' be a rom-com?
- Comedy prepared me for drama. There are a couple techniques you can think of. One of my acting teachers said that comedy is like ping-pong, and drama is tennis. You take things a bit slower, so you do get to breathe more and take some more time.
- I'm a performer.
- I love the deadpan. It's such a strong go-to. It lets the audience make their own decisions about what you're thinking.
- Ever since I can remember, I've always been silly.
- I think fans are going to get everything you'd expect from 'The Office', from awkwardness, to a lot of humor and heart.
- I can bring a crowd down. There should be a contest for that.
- That's the most gratifying thing in the world, helping each other.
- My main goal is to connect with the crowd. I leave room for improv. Whatever happens, happens. When I bring my band with me, it turns into the Craig Robinson comedy dance party.
- I grew up in church, so every time I say certain words, I'm like, 'I'm going to get in trouble.'
- I probably have more words to say in 'Mr. Robot' than I've had in my entire career put together.
- When I start thinking about a role, I read the script a few times and then let it sink in - and then take some time to develop how that character is going to play out and what he's going to do.
- There's something about seeing somebody who thinks they're great and is so wrapped up in their moves, voice, and performance that makes it so wonderfully charming that you can't take your eyes off. That's why we all remember William Hung from those first years of 'American Idol. It's the William Hung effect.
- I have a sound. It's called 'funk mixed with stank.' That's what I do.
- Music is in everything I do.
- Doing voiceover is so much fun because you can play with the lines as much as you want. You can put a whole bunch of energy into it, jump up and down, whatever you got to do.
- We even did a re-imagining of 'Spider-Man' that James Franco starred in that didn't make it into 'This Is The End'. That didn't make the final cut, but I wouldn't be surprised if it made the DVD.
- Nick Swardson used to have birthday paint parties. They were phenomenal.
- A bunch of comedians have gotten in 'trouble' for sharing their views. When an actor or an artist or might come out saying something political or whatever, then it becomes about that view.
- You've got to talk to your kids as both a parent and a friend.
- I understand the importance of mentorship for young people, even outside their parents. That's more important now than ever. You gotta have that support system everywhere you can.
- My father tried to discourage me from going into comedy, mainly because he felt like it wasn't promising. It was pie in the sky.
- Comedy chose me. I always had this urge to be silly that I couldn't control. I remember my father having me read 'The Three Little Pigs' to him, and I would improv all around the story, like when one pig's house got blown over, he put on his gym shoes and took off.
- There's a couple of movie parts that I can't remember. There was always something kind of lurking, because when 'The Office' started, I wasn't a regular. You're a guest star, so they don't really need you. They didn't say that, but I've seen the show - with or without me, it's still funny.
- Who knows if I would get to do 'Mr. Robot' if I was on 'Mr. Robinson?'
- Banging on the piano while my grandmother was watching me. I'd run up to her and ask: 'How was that, Grandma?' And she'd say, 'That was beautiful, baby!' And I'd run back to the piano and play some more. I'm sure that's why I still play today, because I was encouraged from such a young age, 2 or 3.
- I'm starring in the 'New Adventures of Voltron'. I play Voltron.
- I so respect Sundance. I'd been hearing about it for years.
- I love hip-hop, but hip-hop is a way of life.
- Look at the laws: you can't spank a kid without getting in trouble. That kept me in line!
- I never wanted to do just one thing. There's even other things in comedy that I want to do. For me, it's always been that I have to have the vision first.
- A music teacher. It was in the inner city at a school called Horace Mann. I think I was most effective when the kids pissed me off.
- I got mad love for hot tubs.
- I worked with Tyler before on 'Daddy's Little Girls'. He couldn't be smarter or more laid back and cool. He's always throwing out lines and is funny as hell. And he was shining his light on 'Peeples', too, lending his name to showcase Tina as a first-time director, and me as a first-time lead.
- It's good to do something different than the subtleties of 'The Office' all the time.
- I'm just looking at Twitter like, 'Ooooooo.' No, I don't engage, but it's great. There's so many avenues to get your entertainment on; you've got so many people invested in this. I love it.
- In acting, you get to that place where it's serene, where you just feel it. I'm glad to be doing the drama because you can kind of take your time more and let a moment live more.
- Even in comedy, you have to be real. It's all about being real. It's how real can you be? That's the challenge. How much are you willing to take on for your character?
- Anything to do with 'The Office' I would revisit.
- Comedy chose me.
- My whole life, people have been like, 'I don't know if you're playing or serious.'
- As a comic and as an actor, I think you've got to be partially crazy.
- It's a farmers market. You can get whatever - peaches, a sandwich. There might be a little band there. I'd sit in with the band. Yeah, that's what I would do. Sit in with the band at the farmers market. Sing a couple of songs, eat a peach, and hug people.
- I'm a Scorpio. I have different mood swings.
- Nothing is guaranteed.
- I'm focused on the work. And now I've done 'Morris' and 'Mr. Robot,' my appetite is whet to go deeper. It's fun, and it's challenging, and it stretches me. I'm not saying I'm done with comedy by any stretch of the imagination. I'm saying, yeah, let's see how deep the rabbit hole goes.
- I went to the Heidelburg Castle, a 1200-year-old castle, looked around. It was pretty awesome, but you know, they've got a coffee shop in there, and they have some sections closed off. I wanted to see the part where they tortured people, but it was cool, though.
- Always wanted to go to Germany... probably one of my top ten.
- The thing that makes you a good 'Caraoke Showdown' singer is you gotta have some knowledge of these songs. You gotta be ready to attack. You gotta shut your brain off and just go.
- My mother is a retired music teacher. She taught me in high school, and she would take us and put us in these madrigal groups. We would go to a museum or whatever and just perform.
- You know Seth and Evan, they were lead writers for 'Pineapple Express', and they are great at mixing things up. Taking different genres and mish-mashing them up to create something dynamically new. They'll throw comedy at you, but with a dash of horror and fright that is supposed to make you shocked and scared.
- I was in a TV show called 'Lucky' on FX. The casting director from 'Lucky' was casting 'Dragon Wars'. She called me in to meet with the producer and audition, and I got it from there.
- I think I, and the audience, would enjoy a kissing scene with me and Rihanna. That would've been cool for me to see, rehearse, practice, and all that. Me and Rihanna.
- I've had some good moments at karaoke. Back in the day, oh my gosh... before, I was more in the public eye. Nowadays, I don't do it as much because if you do, it's going to be on the Internet.
- I was approached by my agent, who said they were interested in me for 'Mr. Robot'. Then I binge-watched the show, and I was like, 'Uh, I would like this. Show me how I'm gonna fit in there, but yeah, I would love it.'
- I think I said something mean when I was little, and my mother snapped on me. I was just like, 'I'm sorry!' I could relate. If I had cursed out my dad, I probably would be just waking up.
- I have a phrase I say: 'What the damn?' It's my favorite. It just came to me one day.
- It's funny to see how people react to the project, to read their thoughts, and I wonder aloud, 'Did they even watch the movie? Did they even get it?' I know we, myself and the entire cast, put a lot of heart, love and humor into 'Meet the Peeples'. I'm very proud of that film and what we were able to accomplish.
- I got a call from my manager saying, 'Howie Mandel wants to talk to you.' And I'm a comic - big fan of all he's done. He was pitching me 'Caraoke Showdown', and I was just excited about it.
- I'm a band leader and substitute teacher, and then one day they bring me into a music class, and I'm like, 'Wait a minute, I know this stuff.' And the principal is like, 'Just throw the video in and call it a day,' and I'm like, 'That's not good enough. I want these kids to know what it's like to have a gig and all that kind of stuff.'
- It's always nice to do a family movie, because I do a lot of R-rated stuff.
