- The high point of my career was winning the Champions League. No one will ever erase that from my memory, in the same way that no one will ever erase the fact that I did it in a Manchester United shirt.
- I don't mind people hating me, because it pushes me.
- Winning - that's the most important to me. It's as simple as that.
- I have my flaws too, but I am a professional who doesn't like to miss or lose.
- To me, being the best means proving it in different countries and championships.
- People have to understand one thing: at the age of 18, I arrived at a dream club like Manchester United. It was a dream come true. But, even at that moment, I was thinking about playing in England for some years and then going to play in Spain. Even at that time I was thinking that way, and I always gave 100% everything.
- I want to consistently play well and win titles. I'm only at the beginning.
- I never promise anything. I don't promise anything to my mum. I don't promise anything to the supporters.
- I don't like being alone.
- There's no point in making predictions. It's not worth speculating because nothing is set in stone and things change all the time in football. Today there are opportunities that no one knows if they will come round again in the future.
- My friends ask me if I want more kids, and I always say yes, I want more; it's the best thing you can have in your life.
- It obviously bothers people when Real Madrid win. It makes them jealous. There isn't a level playing field.
- I was ironing my own clothes when I was 11 years old. My mental strength goes back to those days.
- I'm living a dream I never want to wake up from.
- Lots of young players have triumphed at United, so why can't it happen to me? I'm not worried I'm young - it's an incentive to do the best I can.
- I have two Golden Boot awards at home. It would be nice to win another, but I wouldn't mind it if I didn't.
- Why lie? I'm not going to be a hypocrite and say the opposite of what I think, like some others do.
- Talent without working hard is nothing.
- One rule that will work if it is used everywhere, is that when you have a free-kick, the referee puts the mark on the floor to make sure the defenders keep their distance.
- My father always taught me that when you help other people, then God will give you double. And that's what has really happened to me. When I have helped other people who are in need, God has helped me more.
- I'm not going to change the world. You're not going to change the world. But we can help - we can all help.
- Every season is a new challenge to me, and I always set out to improve in terms of games, goals, assists.
- I don't have to show anything to anyone. There is nothing to prove.
- Many people look at me and think they know me but they don't at all. This is the real me. I am a humble person, a feeling person. A person who cares about others, who wants to help others.
- There are people out there who hate me and who say I'm arrogant, vain, and whatever. That's all part of my success. I am made to be the best.
- I love Manchester. Everyone knows that - I have said it many times. Manchester is in my heart.
- I'm proud to play for Real Madrid because I have fun; when you no longer have fun it's a sign that it's time to leave. For now though, I'm happy here at the greatest club in the world.
- I was saluted by Alex Ferguson when I was subbed and that made me very happy.

- We cannot live being obsessed with what other people think about us. It's impossible to live like that. Not even God managed to please the entire world.
- I have practically no private life. I'm already used to this and ready for it. Yes, sometimes it is hard, but it is the choice I made.
- To be honest, there are no problems between me and Messi. People have their own opinions about who they think is the better player. It is what it is, but there is no rivalry beyond games and what happens on the pitch.
- In football, I don't have a lot of friends. The people who I really trust, there are not many... Most of the time, I'm alone.
- I am not the humblest person in the world. I admit that.
- At United, there are great traditions, which you can't buy in one or two years. They are created by victories. You need to prove again and again that you are better than the others. Manchester United have always done this, and are still doing it, so they are the best.
- When you are nominated for the best player in Europe, the Ballon d'Or, playing in the Champions League, there is so much pressure. You don't know what will happen. This pressure is inside you - you always have it.

- Without football, my life is worth nothing.
- I know I'm a good professional, I know that no one's harder on me than myself and that's never going to change, under any circumstances.
- I still learn, but I think it's the best thing in life to have a kid.
