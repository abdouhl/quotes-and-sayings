- Getting buried alive will always be my claim to fame.
- I've been on the show for six years and I don't even know what her history is. I sort of make things up in my mind, but I think it's hard for an audience to follow and invest in a character when they don't have the details.
- They've never written a love story for me since I've been on the show and I think there's just more weight to it when two people love each other.

- Danny and I worked really hard in the beginning of the relationship to find different levels of this couple.
