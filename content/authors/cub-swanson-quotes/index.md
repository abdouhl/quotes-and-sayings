- When I was super young, and everybody who has been in fan of mine from the WEC days, I was just tough as nails, fearless and that's what made me tick. I'm not those things anymore. I'm fearless, but I plan ahead. I'm strategic. I'm smarter, and I'm just a different person than I was.
- I'm just not going to let anybody build their name off of me.
- My goal in this sport is to be the best version of myself that I can be.

- There are young guys coming up, trying to make their name off me, and I'm a stubborn dude. I don't want to let that happen. That's very motivating.
- I think that one thing that I've prided myself on is that tough situations make for tougher people and that was one of my goals as well getting into this sport, I wanted to be a tougher human. I wanted to be a tougher man and basically when I had kids I'd be able to be like a superhero to them, and I feel like I'm accomplishing that.

- When someone throws a power shot and you want to counter, you have to lean into it as you block it so that you can come right out with what you are throwing.

- I'm fast and I move well so I know how to come in at weird angles and keep my feet under me. I'm looking for that power shot and I might not be able to fire off anything after it if my feet aren't under me. Footwork is a huge part of my game.

- Whatever big fights I can get, I'm up for the challenge.
- I definitely think that a lot of these fighters should be taken care of long-term. But I feel like we're in that kind of situation where it's, like, the early NFL players.
