- I was going to middle school in Berkley, and I did not fit in at all. Like a lot of kids, I found theater to be a good place for me.
- You can do gross-out until the cows come home but if there isn't something to balance it, then it's not going to work at all.
- To be honest, I haven't seen a lot of the current crop of teen movies because there's only so much time and there's nothing that really drives me to do it.

- Sometimes a person has to be dead a while before people can appreciate what they did when they were alive.
- I'm at least getting my foot in the door as far as doing straight dramatic parts, which no one would have ever considered me for in the '80s. I never objected to that because I love doing comedy, and I'm not the kind of actor that insists that unless you're doing a serious dramatic role, you're not acting.
- I'm a character actor but unlike a lot of character actors, I don't look radically different from film to film and there was a bunch of them at once.
- There's something about the way of playing a repellent character, that if you can play him with a certain amount of charm, you can get away with a lot.
- For an actor to have a role that they're recognized and remembered for over the years, it's unusual. It's very lucky if it happens once - and it's luck that it's happened to me a couple of times.
- In 1984 nobody knew what cable was going to be. It was there, but you didn't know where it was going.
