- I find getting the first draft down to be the biggest challenge. Every word, every punctuation mark, every plot point is a decision. It's much more fun to play with something that already exists.
- I'm fond of my werecats, if only because I have four real-world felines staring at me as I type.
- For me, it's been a treat to interact with authors who were publishing when I was a young reader. Judy Blume once gave me a pep talk at a writing conference. I had a short story featured in the same anthology as Beverly Cleary. Magic.
- Big picture, it's amazing to create characters and see them brought to life in the art. And to love that art. But I especially enjoy writing a character with heightened powers that aren't especially useful to him.
- In terms of graphic versus prose, I could probably do a lecture on that topic. But what stood out most was the difference in pacing the language and resulting scenes. One illustration can do so much for the reader.
- My stories include realistic fiction and fantasy.
- I've always been fond of Tim Drake/Robin. I suppose it's the YA writer in me. I enjoy the intensity of young, smart heroes. I'd love to write him in either graphic or prose form.
- Children and teens take in stories to the deepest imaginable level. What we put on the page can change the people they'll become and the course of their lives.
