- I am so grateful every day to do a job that I love. That is the key to life and what I would like to teach my daughter: do something you love and even if you're not good at it, just blag it.
- When I was in hospital, I recorded a ghost. My fave YouTube channel is Huff Paranormal, which is about a guy who talks to ghosts like he's talking to his neighbours.
- I love reading about ghosts, near-death experiences, astral projection - which is when you leave your body.
- I'm so bad with money, I had to hand all my cards over to my husband. It doesn't comprehend in my brain.
- Oh my God, I used to love 'Just Seventeen'. My treat was to go to Woolworths with my pocket money and get 'Just Seventeen' and a packet of Juicy Fruit.

- At Rada, I was cast as Lady Macbeth and tried to do it as seriously as I could, but people still started laughing. I just think they find my face too funny.
- I went to London for drama school but I hated it.
- I'd love to be an artist. My mum is so talented and she used to design her own greetings cards. I'm crap at drawing though.
- I'm difficult to cast. In comedy, if there's a female character, usually written by a bloke, she's either the ditsy good-looking one, or the sexually aggressive one. I never fit into those.
- Growing up, we loved 'The Royle Family'. Caroline Aherne, she was just incredible.

- I'm terrible at learning lines.
- It's brilliant there are so many writer-performers around.
