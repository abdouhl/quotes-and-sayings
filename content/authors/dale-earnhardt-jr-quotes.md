- I know a lot of Cup Series champions, and they each have a very different personality. They all go about handling adversity, their challenges, and even confrontation a little differently.
- I grew up around it. That was what my friends were listening to - some of my closest friends are big hip-hop fans.
- I've done everything I ever thought I would do. I've done more than I thought I was capable of doing.
- I wish Michael Schumacher would come try NASCAR. That'd be cool.
- I've been able to make a lot of money and live a lifestyle that I never dreamed of. And I've been able to provide for my family.

- I don't think any of us knew the dangers of repeated concussions or the fact that even when you got a concussion, the idea to go get treatment for it never entered our minds. We just didn't have - we weren't educated enough. We were really ignorant to it. I would get concussions in my early 20s racing, and it was a bit of a badge of honor.
- I can't remember ever racing without any pressure.
- I am proud of the Earnhardt name, but it don't stand alone. You know, it's part of the sport, with all those other historic people that have been a part of it, and you don't want people to forget the part you had in it and what you did and the contributions you made and the sacrifices you made.
- I get asked one question a lot: 'What celebrity encounter would render you starstruck?' The answer is simple - anyone who's ever strapped on a Redskins helmet, much less coached them to three Super Bowls.
- I didn't think I was ever going to be a Cup driver. When I was a kid, before I started racing in the Xfinity Series, I thought that I was never going to get a chance, and then, if I did, I wasn't going to run well enough to maintain that opportunity and keep progressing.
- I can cook anything. Anything. I'm good.

- I keep sour grapes in the fridge all the time. And I eat those all day long, all week long, all month. All the time.
- I always make things worse than they are or create problems that aren't there. And going and doing some simple task becomes a problem. I start imagining problems that aren't there. What people are going to think, who's going to judge me and am I going to be good enough? Am I worthy?
- Some people ain't approachable, and some people are.
- Winning the championship is more than 50% driver. It's probably 60% driver, 40% car. I don't really know where luck fits in there - over the course of a season, everybody catches their breaks.
- I don't like going on stage. Stages mean 'nervous' for me.
- I always liked 'The Last American Hero,' the one about Junior Johnson with Jeff Bridges in it.
- I want to continue to be a part of the sport, and not just as an owner in the Nascar Xfinity Series. I want to be a valuable asset to the growth of the sport and continue to help raise the bar and raise the awareness of the sport and promote the sport as much as I can.
- I've always wanted to win a championship so badly.
- I never thought I would ever win a Daytona 500. I never thought we would sweep Bristol. I just never thought any of that stuff was going to happen or be possible.

- I wish I'd a got married sooner. I wish I'd a had kids sooner. I wish I'd a figured all that out sooner.
- I love stock-car racing and NASCAR. I kind of take offense to anybody who has any cross words about it. It's kind of like your brother. You can talk all the crap you want about him, but you won't let anyone else do it.
- When someone tells me they've never been to a race, I tell them that the first one they should go to is Bristol, Tennesee. The shape of the track, the energy, and excitement under the lights is similar to what you might get at a stick-and-ball game in college football or the NFL.
- I look at my trophies and can't believe they're mine.
- My role models weren't holding steering wheels and mashing gears on Sunday. They wore burgundy and gold with names like Art Monk and Darrell Green.
- I think some people who have never met me have a misconception that when I was living with my father when he was successful, that I was somehow adversely affected by his success or the money he had and was making at the time.
- I love running good because it meets expectations, whether it's the fans' or my own. And I know that they come to be entertained: they pull for a particular driver to be entertained by that driver's success and that driver's personality, and they relate to that individual.

- When I run a race, I, maybe inadvertently or unknowingly, concern myself with whether the fan was entertained or got what he expected or whether they got what I think they deserved out of me and out of the race.
- When you have a concussion, one of the symptoms that is common is anxiety. Imagine having the normal amount of anxieties that everybody shares - about life and meeting people in social spaces, whatever. Imagine that being multiplied by 10, 20. And so your worry over people's perceptions of you multiplies.

- The Dodge Charger in the late '70s at Daytona, that looked like an awesome car.
