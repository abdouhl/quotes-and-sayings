- You see people you identify with, and you take pieces of people you like and shape who you are. Like, I sound just like my dad. But that's literally my vocal chords. I can't sound like anything else... I sound like him, but I act like myself.
- I wanted to be an animator originally. I went to art school; I went to art college and everything. But that screen was just calling me.
- Even in real life, sometimes you find that person you click with that you get irritated by every other person in the world but you can be around this person every day and you'd be fine with it.
- My dad was pretty strict. We didn't even get to watch any of his movies until I was, like, 17 years old. I didn't even see his stand-up, really, until I started doing stand-up, and that was when I was 22. So he's pretty strict. We had curfews until I was 17... he didn't play around.
- Television is a thing that people get very familiar with. They want to hear your voice in their head.
- Jim Carrey and my dad were best friends. He would always be in my house and stuff like that.
- I was always the class clown and got kicked out of class at least once a day for just being a goofball. Not suspended or anything, just sit outside and look at the tree on the bench. I got benched a lot. You keep one foot on the bench and try to get as far away as possible.
- My uncle Shawn used to stay with us when we were really young, and I used to come downstairs and see him break dancing on this piece of a cardboard. I probably always thought they were cool since then. I never knew his comedy, but I used to always see him break dancing. And he was terrible at it.
