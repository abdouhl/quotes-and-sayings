- I think all chefs who pursue great flavor have good ethics.
- It's a fallen world. We eat and sacrifice in the process.
- Vegetables deplete soil. They're extractive. If soil has a bank account, vegetables make the largest withdrawals.
- There is no such thing as guilt-free eating.
- We need the humbleness and clarity to see that our food, while benefitting from technological advances, has benefitted even more from free ecological resources: Cheap energy, lots of water everywhere, and a stable climate.
- People complain that cities don't have fresh, sustainable food, but it's just not true.
- When you pursue great flavor, you also pursue great ecology.
- I'm not an environmentalist, or a doctor, or a nutritionist.
- Conventional agriculture has never succeeded in feeding the world, and it's never produced anything good to eat. For the future, we need to look toward alternatives.
- If you look at the carrying capacity of agricultural areas throughout the world, their ecological habitats are changing. So I think we're looking at - in our lifetime - great collapses of food services.
- I'm not here to say I don't eat vegetables - I do, a lot of them - but, from a soil perspective, they're actually more costly than a cow grazing on grass.
