- If you've become a huge act and you're still doing the same music you wrote with your friends when you were making zero dollars, you're lazy.
- What's completely insane to me is that people would consider music that's simple to be dumbed-down. Couldn't simplicity be a deliberate, smart choice?
- I just wanted to make a record that wasn't escapism. Like, I didn't want to write another record that was devoid of meaningful content.
- The main thing I want to do is make people feel more connected and more active.
