- I've had so many parents ask me, 'So when should you talk about what it means to be gay or LGBTQ with a child?' I don't think there's any age that's too young.
- I'm tired of living the vanilla, non-offensive life. I think that's a really sad way to spend my life, and I lived it like that because that's what I was brought up in, taught to not rock the ship.

- I grew up and had a lot of friends who were gay and Mormon. They couldn't come out to their parents. They couldn't even come out to me because we just wouldn't talk about it.
- I've spent a lifetime trying not to offend people - that's one thing that Mormons are really good at is smiling and shaking your hand and doing everything they can to not offend you. And I have gotten to this point in life where I don't want to live that way anymore.
- LoveLoud isn't just for the youth, but also their families and friends. They can attend and become educated on how to truly love and accept our LGBTQ youth.

- There's nothing wrong or weak about seeking a therapist. I have a therapist.
