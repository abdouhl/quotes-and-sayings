- I took a break to take care of a lot of stuff that I'd let go by the wayside for decades.
- 'iCarly' gives me the luxury of addressing the fans directly. It was a sort of loving nudge to the fans saying, 'We're just a fun little sitcom to make you laugh.' This isn't a heavy-duty soap opera.
- Kids spend seven hours a day in school, and they have their homework at night. I'm not there to moralize or to teach them right from wrong. We're there to provide something that is really fun, that's a diversion.
- What I loved about TV when I was a kid was that no matter where you came from or who you were - black, white, rich or poor - you knew the same shows. It was a common thing in our culture.
- That's the goal with TV, to make something that everybody likes and that gets remembered forever.
- Right when I moved to L.A., I started writing. I wrote some screenplay. I'm sure it's terrible. But I wrote a screenplay by myself. When I first moved to L.A., I had no friends. I didn't know anybody. I just sat in a little studio apartment, and I wrote a screenplay.
- On my Nickelodeon shows - 'Victorious' is my seventh show for the channel - there's this same distinct comedic voice that goes throughout. I'm not saying it's brilliant, but it works and kids think it's funny.
- I try to make a great sitcom that would make my heroes proud of me.
- Even the kids who seem to have a lot of freedom, their lives are pretty controlled. So what I try to do on my shows is to have kids come out on top. They're the smartest ones in the room. They're the ones in charge.
- By the time I was on TV, I was 19, but I played a kid, and they treated us like kids, so it's almost like I was a kid actor. Basically we were considered props who spoke.
- Delegating is something that I don't do as much of as people wish I would.
- I'm never going to write fart jokes, because I feel like I have a responsibility to the audience to give them good stuff. I should be able to come up with something funnier than any third-grade boy could think of.
- My TV comedy idols are the Charles brothers, who did 'Cheers;' Larry Gelbart, who did 'MASH;' and Larry David, who did 'Seinfeld.' When I was 6 or 7-years-old, I'd watch 'Saturday Night Live' and guys like John Belushi and Dan Akroyd became my on-screen heroes.
- Nobody gives a damn that I was in 'Head Of The Class,' but when they know I was Ricky in 'Better Off Dead,' they're like 'Holy crap, man! You were Ricky.' They go crazy.
- Really, when people put together the highlight reels of the classic moments from 'Friends,' 'Seinfeld,' 'Cheers,' even 'MASH,' they're full of broad slapstick comedy. Call it cheap or lowbrow, but it works and it works for people of all ages.
- I think so much of kids' television, kids' entertainment, is done by adults from a looking-back point of view. If we come up with a really great joke that will make me laugh hard and would make my friends laugh, we pitch it aside.
- I was 21 and thinking, 'When this 'Head Of The Class' boat ride ends, I don't want to fade off into the sunset. I want to keep working. I want to be involved in the entertainment business.'
- By the mid-'80s, I was an actor. I was never super-famous, but I was definitely on the map.
- I create a world where kids rule. If you think about it, kids are always being told what to do, what to say, when to do it - they're very controlled... I give them an escape, where the kids are in charge.
- My dad would have me watch the shows that he liked. I watched 'I Love Lucy.' I watched 'The Dick Van Dyke Show.' I watched 'M*A*S*H' and 'Mary Tyler Moore' and 'Bob Newhart' and 'Taxi' and 'Cheers.'
- I think the networks used to try to program for kids and family.
- A lot of times people who write sitcoms for the 18 to 49 crowd think writing for kids is easy. It really isn't. First of all, you're very restricted in what you can do.
- I realize we're not curing diseases with 'iCarly,' and we're not doing Shakespeare. It's not an Academy Award-winning film, but it has definitely touched people universally.
- Having been on the other side of the camera gives me such perspective on what I'm doing.
- My shows are meant to be entertaining, not educational.
- It's fun to intentionally write bad dialogue. It's not so fun when you do it, but didn't mean to.
- Many shows in television have tried to do a Web element, and usually it's dumb. 'iCarly' has set the bar in television and Internet. I don't think there is better example. That may be the most significant thing about it.
- My friends and family would say I'm in an arrested mental state of development.
- I've said from the start that I'm not going to write kiddie sitcoms.
- Really, I'm just a big kid myself.
- It's a huge high to be able to earn a nice living doing the thing I love most - making comedy.
- I liked television in the old days. I liked that everybody knew every episode of 'The Brady Bunch,' everybody knew every episode of 'Cheers.'
- I couldn't, and I wouldn't have the long-term friendships and continued loyalty from so many reputable people if I'd mistreated my actors of any age, especially minors.
- Publicity ultimately means bigger ratings.
- Over the years, I've grown and matured as a producer and leader.
- I used to write sketches. I loved David Letterman in the '80s. I used to write Top 10 lists for him, and I faxed them in anonymously. I'm sure they threw them away.
- When I was a kid, my favorite show was 'Happy Days.' If I could have heard a recording of the cast of Happy Days just sitting around having fun, talking about the show in a party atmosphere, I'd have lost my mind.
- I actually wrote an episode of 'Head Of The Class.'
- Everywhere I go, kids are always, 'I want to be a star, I want to be on TV.'
- Jerry Trainor is one of the funniest people on the planet.
- Casting is what I put at the top of the heap in importance to any show that I do.
- We work hard to make a good show and it's exciting to be recognized by a third party.
- When I was on 'Head of the Class,' 25 million, 30 million people would watch that every night - now a big hit doesn't get a third of that audience.
- You don't want to hang out day after day with people you don't want to be with.
- With people all the way from 17 to 2... 'iCarly' often is the No. 1 show, not just on cable but all of television.
- I think the most important thing I do as head writer of 'Kenan & Kel' and 'All That' is make sure any jokes we do, any situations we approach are from a kid's point of view.
- Sometime in the early to mid-'90s, 8 P.M. television went away from family to being 'Friends' - and you really don't want your 10-year-old watching 'Friends.'
- We try to cast very real kids who have raw talent.
- I think my shows can draw an audience of 12 million because I ask, 'What can make a 7-year-old, a 17-year-old, a 30-year-old and a 77-year-old laugh?'
- I try not to cast icky people.
- I don't think of myself as a guy who writes for kids, I really don't. I try really hard to write a good, solid sitcom.
- I don't want to be an old man some day and look it up and see some episode of one of the shows I did and go, 'ugh,' and be disappointed in myself.
- I never interacted with actors in any way, texting or otherwise, that should make anyone uncomfortable.
- If there is anything I've learned about kids today - and I'm not saying this is good or bad - it's that they all want to be stars.
- I'm very willing to defend creative things that I believe in.
- I don't want to wake up at 60 and have to call the neighbor who's 12 to help me with my computer.
- I had a great relationship with my parents, but there's something about hanging out with your older sibling that just has a whole new level of cool for a kid.
- As everyone who works for me knows, I almost never let the girls wear ponytails on my shows.
- I have a rule: Kids get to be the star.
