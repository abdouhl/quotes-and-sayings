- All that money stuff was so strange; all it ever meant to me was freedom from worry. I'm happier now than I've ever been but I still wish I had that money.
- I like to go with the energy because when you ignore it that's when you start doing things wrong.
- Growing up, all I did was work and vacation, but I loved it, no one pushed me into anything. The thing was I developed no special skills. I don't have any resentment because I am a performer and I've always felt that, but it did take its toll socially.

- I've got to be honest, there's no pleasure when you're working.
- I have been sober for the longest time. Oh, it's over a decade now. No joke.
- I'm tired of defending my character. I am what I am. What you see is what you get.
- I've learned through experience that life is never that bad. The secret is just paying attention to how you feel and not letting anyone else dictate what in your heart you know is right.
- I'm learning to play by the rules. I sort of hate to think of it that way, but that's how it is. I'm really learning to function out there and in such a way that I don't need to drink.
- I'd hopefully work through all my issues with men first so then I'd be okay being with a woman.
