- I appreciate the city of New York just embracing me, and Brooklyn in general.

- That's my ultimate goal, just being a part of something special.
- As far as coming out on top with the right mentality and it molding you into the best human being you can be, I think that's what Brooklyn did for me. I became an All-Star, I got to touch the playoffs. To get a piece of that, I'm forever thankful.
