- Technology will eventually destroy the way schools are run now.
- You can't make someone learn something - you really can't teach someone something - they have to want to learn it. And if they want to learn, they will.
- When kids play, they are working on imagining the kind of world we live in.
- So, I see technology as a Trojan Horse: It looks like a wonderful thing, but they are going to regret introducing it into the schools because it simply can't be controlled.

- And they understand that to be an effective member of a democracy, you have to accept responsibility.
- If you watch young children play, you will notice that they create games, characters, situations, whole worlds in which they immerse themselves with intense concentration.
- But, if you observe children learning in their first few years of life, you can see that they can and do learn on their own - we leave them alone to crawl, walk, talk, and gain control over their bodies. It happens without much help from parents.
- I think people with open minds will observe the way we do things and realize that our goal is to have successful, happy, productive adults, and they will take our ideas and implement them elsewhere for their own children.
- Just the concept of personal freedom within a democracy, for instance, is a relatively young idea - only about 300 years old in this country.
