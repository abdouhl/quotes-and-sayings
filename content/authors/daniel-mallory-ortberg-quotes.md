- I think female solitude is a mental condition as well as a physical state. You can be married and a spinster. I think spinster is an identity every woman can claim, if she will... I feel like a lot of women, or a lot of feminists, joke about taking to the sea or living alone in a cottage as this kind of fun freedom.

- I have fun going on Twitter and the Internet. I feel safe and comfortable, and I wish everyone could feel that way.
- Usually, the first thing I do when I wake up is I start working, so I often won't start the day by reading anything because I like to minimize my 'commute' as much as possible. I wake up, open my laptop and start working in bed.
- I graduated with an English degree and worked for awhile in academic publishing.
- I'm on Twitter a lot of the day because I really like Twitter. It's great for jokes. But when I'm writing, I can't do anything else. I can't even listen to music. I just have to write, and then I can do something else. I can't multitask.
- Eighty per cent of my output is 'Mallory clowns on the Western canon,' and I'm happy to be that person.
- My credentials, briefly: I no longer go to church or believe in God, but I can still name every one of the fruits of the Spirit and reeled for days upon hearing the announcement that Audio Adrenaline was reunited with one of the singers from DC Talk.
- Usually my writing is very over the top and bombastic and very, like, 'I'm amazing! Look at me!'

- After I do my first writing of the day, I will generally look at Twitter and Google News - and that's my big media secret. I look at Twitter and I look at Google because they pull all the headlines from other websites.
- Weirdly, often the more I write, the more ideas I have.
- It certainly was unusual growing up with two fairly well-known pastors as my parents.
- We went to church twice a week. My parents were employed in ministry; we prayed before dinner. We rollerbladed in the summer. We were allowed to watch the 'Simpsons.' I fought with my younger brother over Legos.

- When I was twenty years old, I had gum grafts put in.

- A lot of my creative energy is spent coming up with a concept that, once I get it, I feel like it writes itself.
- Anything where I get to write a lot of jokes and have a lot of creative control - that's all I want.
