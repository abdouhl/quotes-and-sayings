- I feel very ready to be a pop star. I feel like that's something that I deserve, and I feel prepared for being number one in the charts!
- I really enjoy '24 Hours In A&E.' I always cry my heart out at it.
- My mum and dad were incredibly supportive - although I suspect my dad would have preferred me to go the university route. However, I know they were extremely proud when I won the 2011 BAFTA Best Actor for playing comedian Eric Morecambe in 'Eric and Ernie.'
- A lot of the flowers I like are weeds. Oh, and dandelions, but they're a weed, too.
- I would die of pleasure if 'The Day Today' or 'Brass Eye' came back. Though there's something really special about the fact that they only did one series of each.
- My nana used to tape 'The Simpsons' when it aired on Sky. We'd get the VHS tapes - my dad would courier them from Nana's house to us - and we'd watch them on Sunday nights.
- When I was little, I was obsessed with Roland Rat. I also loved Danger Mouse. Later on, when I got a bit older, I was obsessed with Ren & Stimpy, but Roland Rat and Danger Mouse, they were my guys. They were my team.
- I like to think in an emergency situation, I'd act in a really brave way. But the truth is if I ever did get in a situation that looked remotely dangerous, I'd fall on my knees and start crying.
- I think I might have exaggerated some abilities in the past. Practical abilities for acting jobs you sometimes have on your CV - I have definitely exaggerated in meetings to get a job and then not been up to scratch on the day.
- I was a big fan of 'Blackadder,' and my first commercial was directed by John Lloyd - I could have bored him for hours if I'd known he directed my favourite show!
- I was about ten when I first got laughs playing Fagin in 'Oliver' at junior school in Offerton. It was the best feeling in the world, and I didn't want it to end.
- What sticks in my mind from seeing the Teletubbies is Tinky Winky's handbag and Tubby Custard. I always remember wanting to have a glass of Tubby Custard and some Tubby Toast in the morning.
- I decided I'd try my hand as a stand-up comedian, as I loved making people laugh, and appeared at the Latitude Festival, won the 2007 Laughing Horse New Act of the Year, and was a nominee for winner of the 2007 So You Think You're Funny competition.
- It's a total thrill to be helping to bring the Teletubbies back to life.
- I have two younger brothers, and we're very close in age.
- For some reason, I got really obsessed with Samuel Pepys and his diaries when I read them, and with that period. I was probably a man with a wig and a frock coat in a past life!
- I'd quite like to invent something that allows me to in eat the shower - not sure what it would entail. Some sort of funnel that goes from the plate to my mouth to move the food to my mouth and keep it dry, perhaps.
- 'Teletubbies' is a national institution, and it was a privilege to be asked to be their voice. It feels super surreal, but it does feel wonderful.
