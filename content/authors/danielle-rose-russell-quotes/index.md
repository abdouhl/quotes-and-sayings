- When 'Legacies' picked up, we never really saw the history between both of the twins.
- I think there's a real sex appeal to vampires. They're very sexy.
- I really enjoy doing stunts, especially. I had never done any stunt work, ever, in my life before, and in our first episode of 'Legacies,' I was doing a bunch.
- I'm always studying actors and movies. You can never not do your homework.
- I did a lot of screaming in 'The Originals,' and I hurt my voice so badly that I said, 'I can't scream if you want me to be able to work for, like, the next three days.' So, what I usually do is that I scream once in the season, and we'll just use that scream, all throughout, or extend it, or do whatever we need to do.
- As an actor, I love to play a good crying scene.
- As someone who watched 'The Vampire Diaries' when I was 10 or 11, getting to be Miss Mystic Falls was very surreal for me.
- What was important for 'Legacies' to actually be a successful show is that we had to introduce new mythology.
- I hadn't seen anything of 'The Originals' until I was down to the end for the role and I watched the whole fourth season, and then, when I got it, I did my proper homework.
- 'Legacies' is its own show, and it takes on a younger twist to the supernatural world.
- I had only ever done films that never had this huge fan base. I acted just to act. And so, coming into 'The Originals' and 'Legacies' and that fandom for the first time, I didn't know how to handle it at first, but I have a better grip on it now.
- I love to cook; I love to bake. It's, like, my favorite thing besides acting.
- I always think it's really nice to see characters band together and fight for what they all believe in.
- I have a very normal social group that I really feed off of. They ground me. They're super supportive.
- I started really working in, like, 2014, so I was 13, 14 years old.
