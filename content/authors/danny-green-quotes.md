- There's a lot of guys in this league you're not going to stop. You can contain them, so the best bet, especially in the playoffs is try to contain most teams' All-Stars or their superstars and limit their role players.
- I think the best thing with any superstar is to try to limit his touches. Try not to let him catch the ball where he wants it, try to deny him some, double team him some, throw different looks at him.

- That's probably the biggest thing for any team in the playoffs, for every team - if you want to win. It's not about your numbers. It's not about scoring. It's about the team and whatever it is you need to do to help the team win. Whether it's rebounding, taking charges, getting steals, blocking shots or guarding somebody.
- Two very great players. A lot of similarities and some differences, but they are extremely serious about their game. They work their body hard, how to take care of their bodies and lead their team. Obviously, Kawhi is not as vocal as LeBron has been over the years.
