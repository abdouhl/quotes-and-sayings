- I'm proud to come from the Midwest and that's where I'm comfortable at.
- I don't regret trying acting. When I decided to stop, I don't regret that either.
- I'm glad I was in 'The Shining.' It was not a bad experience for me. It just wasn't something that panned out and I decided to go back to being a regular kid.
- I know it might be kind of ironic, but I like funny films and documentaries.
- People don't recognize me when I got out in public.
- I once read that I had six kids and was a pig farmer. That's not entirely accurate.
- In the end, auditioning was a big deal. It was a long trip for us. I had to take off school and my parents had to take off work. In the end, it wasn't very fruitful. I think it was just before high school, I decided this wasn't much fun anymore so that was it.
- I teach biology, it's kind of a difficult science and time is limited. As far as I'm concerned, it's all about the students. I teach classes that are for majors, so some of them are pre-med, pre-pharmacy and pre-dentistry and veterinarians.
- I don't do many interviews. But when I do, I try to make it clear, 'The Shining' was a good experience.
- For me when I watch 'The Shining,' it's like watching a home movie. I understand how it scares people. I think it's an entertaining movie, don't get me wrong. But I look back on it with so many memories.
