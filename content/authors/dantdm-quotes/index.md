- I have 3 pugs.
- The YouTube industry is quite alien to a lot of people.
- So Jemma and I have always loved dogs and a few years ago we took the plunge and decided to finally own our very own pug, Ellie! From there, we fell in love with the breed and are pug mad!
- What's cool about YouTube, unlike TV, is that there isn't that competition element. I mean, you could make it into that, as there's obviously numbers involved, but people are free to watch whoever they want.
- Touring the world was almost like a side project that got out of control. It's like two incredibly demanding full-time jobs that I'm trying to do at once.
- We're all trapped in the digital world. It's filled with cat videos, and you have to dodge comments about how much you stink.
- I just like to make fun videos, I guess.
- I know people that make similar content to me who are 30 or 40 years old. So I don't think there is an age limit to it at all.
- Pugs are really great dogs to have as they are such loyal, funny companions.
- The best thing about YouTube is that anyone can do it, and that's exactly what I did.
- Everyone experiences bullying at some point - there are always older kids who think it's cool to pick on the younger kids.
- When I started making Minecraft videos, there was already a ton of them out there. But when I started introducing the storytelling element, which no one had done before, that's when my Minecraft traffic started picking up.
- We've been to New York twice, and I quite like it a lot.
- Everything you see on my channel was made by me - no one else was involved.
- So I do make a real effort that all of my videos are things that, if I had kids, I wouldn't mind them watching.
- Because the cool thing about media and the online world nowadays is that anyone can do it. Whereas I think through traditional media, if you have something that you want to create, you have to know the right people and get a little bit lucky as well.
- I feel like I've got really good rapport with parents. They always say I'm a YouTuber they can feel safe just letting their kids watch.
- There must be a level of skill, but that is not necessarily why people watch my videos.
- I'm a very visual person, which is probably why I make videos rather than write scripts.
- Small things sometimes mean a whole lot!
- Learning a game and doing something wrong is sometimes funnier than being good at it.
- I have many friends and close collaborators working with Maker, which inspired my decision to join forces with the team, and couldn't be more excited to be part of the many exciting things happening at Maker and Disney.
- I'm not a massive reader of traditional books.
- If I wanted to show family or friends content that had loads of cursing in it, I wouldn't be as proud of that.
- Divorce is hard enough when you're an adult - never mind when you're a child. That was probably when my shyness started, when I was at my shyest.
- If you put something online, it's essentially there forever. You don't know who's kept it, who's screenshotted it.
- When I do fan meet-ups, the pugs usually end up getting more gifts than me!
- If someone's making a decision on your behalf, make sure you trust them.
- The beauty of the Internet is pretty much unlimited.
- I just think it's so important to have fun because if you're having fun, then your viewers will have fun too.
- I think pugs are actually the perfect dog for YouTubers, just because they're lapdogs. YouTubers spend a lot of time at home, and they're perfect companion dogs. When you need to work, they don't mind. They love sleeping!
- Keeping it clean is important to me because I'm just aware of my audience. My audience is a younger generation and, just in general, I wouldn't want to show my mom a video of me swearing like crazy. It's good clean fun.
- There's a common misconception that if I uploaded a 20-minute video that I just pressed 'record' and put it online. It's not that at all.
