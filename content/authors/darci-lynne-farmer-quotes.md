- It's so God-given - my talent - because it took so very little time to get it down to where I was able to perform.
- That was my goal going on 'AGT,' was to keep ventriloquism alive and get it more common, to put it out in the open so kids like me who wanted to pursue it as a passion... can do it.
- I like to watch 'America's Got Talent' every Tuesday just to scout out the competition so I can see what I'm up against.
- I don't see myself as celebrity like other people do. I just think that's funny.
- Singing in multiple voices, especially Oscar's, can make my vocal chords tired.
- I go to California and to New York, and it's not like the people are really mean.
- I don't like sweet, warm beverages. It makes me gag!
- It's a little crazy. Last year, I was in seventh grade, and we were the babies at the school - 'cause my middle school's eighth grade and seventh grade - and now I'm eighth grade, and all these new students have come in, and they're all like, 'Oh my gosh! Darci Lynne!'
- I got to perform at the Grand Ole Opry, which is just so amazing. That stage is iconic; it was awesome being on it.
- My last name's kind of interesting - Farmer. I don't really think it's interesting for the stage. I think Lynne kind of had a better ring to it.
- One time, it was really funny, I was going on stage... and they were like, 'Oh, we didn't mic the puppet! Mic the puppet!' So, that's how I know that sometimes I do a very good job, because they think that the puppet is actually, like, real.
- I fangirl when I see someone famous wish me congratulations.
- During the week, I'm a normal kid, and then on the weekends, I go out and perform to thousands of people.
- Ventriloquism kind of helped me find my voice. It's really helped me come out of my shell.
- I just really like performing for different crowds and seeing different places.
- It's so fun being on the stage and in the spotlight.
- I do get recognized a lot in public. And that's just kind of weird to me.

- GE Appliances has agreed to give my mom a whole kitchen's worth of new appliances and a washer and dryer, and all I need to do is shout them out.
- I love hanging out with my friends, because I have the best group of friends ever.
- I want to meet Jimmy Fallon. I want to meet Kristin Chenoweth, and I want to meet Ryan Gosling.
- Petunia relates to me more than any other. She was shy at first, but she's definitely come out of her shell, I can tell you that. Petunia is like this small little rabbit, but her big huge voice comes out of her little body.
- Being on 'America's Got Talent' has really helped me expand my self-confidence on the stage and anywhere - I'm more comfortable, and it's just really helped, and I'm glad about that.
- Edna - when I first picked her up, she had a voice that really spoke to me.
- My parents prepared me for the worst, hoped for the best.
- Oklahoma is my home. It's definitely slower paced than California.
- We always go to downtown Oklahoma City to look at all the Christmas lights that have been put up... We go to the Christmas Eve service at church, and we always beg my parents to open a present - just one present - on Christmas Eve. We get them to cave.
- I actually am a country music fan. I listen to a lot of Blake Shelton and Carrie Underwood and Maren Morris and Keith Urban.
- Pentatonix are amazing, and meeting Hunter Hayes was awesome.
- I really don't want to guess or assume. I just leave it all to the man upstairs and the future. I'm just excited to see what comes next, and I'm gonna be ready for it.
- It's good to get critiqued, so you can get better - and I want to do that.
- I sing 'Blue Moon of Kentucky.' It's a country song. It's one of my favorites to sing.
- I go to public school, which is nice because that's where I can go to be Darci, and when I perform, I'm Darci Lynne. It's my balance.
- Embrace who you are. It's OK if you're shy sometimes. Just don't worry about what others think. Do your thing.
- I don't really want to be known as just the puppet girl or just a singing ventriloquist. I want to be known as the performer, singer, ventriloquist, actress, Broadway star, all of it. I want do it all.
- 'Stranger Things' is the best TV show ever made, so I love watching that.
- I'm a real-life 'Hannah Montana.'
- I wouldn't have the experience or the confidence to go on 'AGT' without being on 'Little Big Shots' because doing 'Little Big Shots' was really fun, but it was also really good practice for my appearance on 'AGT,' and it was just a great, awesome experience that I will remember always.
- It's weird to think I'm in a show in Vegas with my name in lights. It's crazy, like a dream.
- Oklahoma has been so great to me.
- First, I am definitely going to give some money to my mission program at church, and then I have to get my mom a dishwasher.

- We are a very faithful family, and that's very important.
- It's just weird because I can't believe that all those people wanna come see me. Like, there's so many. So, it's just crazy to think about, but it's also really awesome.

- I wanted to get a puppy, but then things started getting super, super busy, and I didn't have a chance.
- We filmed part of it here at the Alex Theatre in Los Angeles, and then we filmed the other part of it in Oklahoma because that's where I live. It's called 'Darci Lynne: My Hometown Christmas.' We wanted to incorporate that I celebrate Christmas just like any other kid.
- I usually hold a puppet and play with different voices until something happens and the right voice just hits me. Then, I'll pick a name that just seems to fit the character that naturally comes out.
- I think little chubby dogs are the cutest.
- I can't remember if I got recognized at Disneyland. I probably did a couple of times as well, but I can't remember.
- I love singing - singing was basically kind of my passion before ventriloquism.
- I would love to get a pug. A puppy, a baby pug - I just want one so bad.
- I got to go to Hawaii with my family. That was really, really fun.
- Saying certain letters without moving my mouth is tough... like B, P and W, you know.
- I love eating Chipotle.
- I have to control my mouth - and that's hard enough - and then I have to manipulate the puppet and make it look real - like, make its interactions look real. And then I have to sing at the same time, and I have to have my facial expressions reacting to the puppet... So it's a lot going on, and I have to focus on every single thing at the same time.

- I'm always going to have the puppets, probably not for the rest of my life, but I'm not going to stop doing ventriloquism anytime soon. I'm just going to add singing, recording songs, and maybe playing in a TV show.
- I guess just being more known is the biggest change, getting noticed in public and having a lot of followers on Instagram and things like that. Just a crazy new life.
- I just say go for it and be yourself, even if you're scared or nervous, because you'll never know what happens if you don't try.
- All of my puppets have their own personalities, their own background, and they enjoy what they do. How they say things, sing things, how they talk. I kind of created them out of my own personality. They are all me.
- A little before my 10th birthday, I was like, 'Can I please have a puppet, Mom and Dad?' They were like, 'No. You are a singer, not a ventriloquist. You have three brothers, and you're in gymnastics. There's no way we have time for this.'
- What has been so great out of all of the success is that I inspired so many people to take up ventriloquism, especially little kids.
- I used to have a really hard time talking to people or looking them in the eye. Or I'd always, like, hide behind my mom, and, like, when we went to restaurants, I didn't like ordering my food. I'd have my mom order it because I didn't like talking to the waiters.
- I had to keep up with my schoolwork so I could keep up my grades. That was tough to balance both being a superstar onstage but being a normal kid trying to get her math homework done.
- There are times where I'm like, 'I wish I can do this' or 'I wish I can be normal like this,' but with my life, I try to keep it normal.
- I actually did a project with my puppet one time in fourth grade. I made up a song that went with the rhythm to a song I do now. And I had to make up a song about a penguin and research and put information in the song about a penguin. And I sang it with my duck, because I didn't have a penguin puppet, but close enough.
- Sometimes when I'm performing, whenever my puppet cracks a joke, it actually makes me laugh.
- I decided I want to sing more because that's been my passion since I was six.
- I'm a person who hates practicing. It's my arch-nemesis, but it helps.
- I do a lot of vocal exercises and drink hot tea, which I hate.
- One day, my brother had his friend over, and they were in the laundry room, and I stuck my puppet's head around the door and then started chasing them with it and made my puppet laugh very scary. It was really funny.
- 'AGT' was so much fun because I feel like the best part was meeting all of the contestants because everyone there was never mean, never competition - except for Preacher. But I'm kidding. He would just mess around and be like, 'I'm gonna beat you.' Everybody there was just really nice, and I got to be friends with mostly everyone there.
- Even though I'm in this big, crazy business, I'm still just myself. I still celebrate Christmas; I still live at home.
