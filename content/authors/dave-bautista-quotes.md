- People look at me, and they have a certain perception, and they slap a label on me. The guy you saw in a wrestling ring is not who I am.
- The worst injury I have ever suffered in the ring was a torn triceps; they had to take a piece of my hamstring to repair the tear. It was brutal; I was out for 6 months.
- Especially, I don't want to ever be compared to The Rock because I'd be the poor man's version of The Rock. I'm just not him; it's not who I am as a person or as a performer. The Rock's very big and bold, and I'm not.
- Yes, I am physical but never go looking for fights. I have been in my share of them but never looked for them.
- For some reason, I'm the guy people love to hate, which I think is weird. People who know me find that very strange, but for some reason, I am. I don't mind being that guy - I have fun with it.
- I internalize everything, keep everything inside. I'm not used to spilling my guts, and when you have to do that on film to make a point, it's hard. It's rough. I don't think it's as easy as people think.
- Honestly, I don't aspire to be a huge movie star. I really just fell in love with acting... Everything I do on-screen is very subtle.
- I had been struggling to get roles in Hollywood for three and a half years after leaving the WWE. Then I finally got an agent - the agent I have now. He's a great guy, but he turned me down three times before he even decided to take me on a as a client.
- I never excelled at one sport or had a very strong passion for anything other than wrestling and bodybuilding.
- I look like a gorilla, just the way I'm built.
- I'm a professional wrestler at heart, and I miss it.
- For some reason, I struggle seeing myself as a leading man.
- I was actually sitting on stage at a press conference one day, and I totally lost touch with reality. I just thought to myself: 'Vin Diesel is sitting next to me, and Benicio Del Toro's on the other side. This is weird, man.'
- Sometimes it's hard to get people to take me seriously as an actor when they just see me as this WWE muscle head.
- I'm still learning and trying to become a better actor. I still feel insecurity.
- It's a weird thing... putting your emotions out there for everybody to see while filming. I think it puts you in a kind of vulnerable state.
- I was a poor kid. I came from nothing. We didn't have any money; a lot of times we didn't have any food, and now, all of a sudden, I'm a superhero in a Marvel movie? Talk about the American dream, man - I'm living it.
- Drax isn't your average stereotypical soldier/warrior/musclehead. He actually has some depth. It was a character that I wanted to play, not only because I love acting so much, but also, I needed to play to get people to actually take me seriously as an actor and get away from the pro wrestling label.
- Know your lines; otherwise, have an open mind because you want to get lost in the moment. When you have talented actors and directors to work with, then it's pretty easy to do.
- I was an amateur wrestler, which I loved. It was my passion, but I started really late; I was a junior in high school when I began.
- 'Smallville' gig was another one of those things I got through WWE. At that point, I had absolutely no aspirations to pursue acting.
- My first acting lessons were Shakespeare. The first time I ever started working with a coach was doing scenes from 'Measure for Measure,' which were tough dramatic scenes. And then 'Taming of the Shrew,' which required comedic timing. And that's the kind of stuff I love.
- I'm particular about the projects that I've chosen. Each one of them, I've taken a step up, like climbing a ladder. Before, it was baby-steps, up to 'Riddick.' Then I took this huge leap onto 'Guardians!' It was such a higher level, this huge project which originally I never thought I'd have a chance in hell of getting.
- It was always one of my favorite things, the action figures, the video games, when I was with WWE, even though I'm not a gamer. I would literally go out and buy the games just so I could play myself.
- Nothing can motivate me any more than I'm already motivated. It just can't happen. Me being motivated was never a factor. Never.
- You do take a beating in professional wrestling. But I love it.
- I'm not a big guy. I'm not a menacing guy. I'm not an intimidating guy. I may look that way, but just spend two seconds talking to me, and you know that's not who I am - not as a person, as a character. It's not who I intend to be.
- I don't watch my playbacks because I hate to see myself act.
- The pressure is always stepping on stage with actors who are just so well-established. It's a scary thing. I haven't been around the block that many times, especially not on big projects. Dialogue makes things easier. When you start bouncing dialogue off of other actors, it becomes comfortable; it becomes conversational.
- Just getting auditions was rough. But also just learning how to act - when I did my first role, in a film I did which was a favour to a friend, I realised I was really bad at it.
- I don't want to intimidate people. There's nothing bullyish about me, you know. If there's anybody who's anti-bully, it's me.
