- My children were taught at an early age how money works and that it comes from hard work. They've been on a commission - not an allowance - since they were little. They learned that if they worked around the house, they got paid. If they didn't work, they didn't get paid.

- Most of the things we buy are wants. And we call them needs, but they're wants.
- While I encourage people to save 100% down for a home, a mortgage is the one debt that I don't frown upon.
