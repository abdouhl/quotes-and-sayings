+++
- My work explores the frontier between rationalism and superstition and the wavering boundary between the two.
- I learned to be a regional writer by reading people like Flannery O'Connor. She was a huge influence.
- Themes around education and learning run through my work.
- It's always been the case that politicians want different things from children than good educators do. Good educators want imaginative, exploratory beings, but politicians just want economic units.
- I know I'm writing better now than I ever did for adults because I'm writing for an audience who know that they don't know everything.
- The sounds and rhythms of words are really important to me.
