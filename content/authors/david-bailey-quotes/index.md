- It's not about composition. It's the way you feel about how your objects should relate to each other.

- I was surrounded by strong women so it had never even occurred to me that women were anything other than equal to men.
- The reason I did fashion was it was the only way to get paid to do anything creative. You couldn't support yourself as an 'artist' - I hate that word. The only way you could be 'arty' was as a fashion photographer, because it still had a certain amount of integrity involved.
- Fortunately I didn't get educated because if I'd got educated I'd be an educated fool now.

- I did painting before I did photography.
- The trouble with people like Tony Blair is they get confused, they think intelligence is education when they're two different things.

- I won't do advertising if they bring a layout and say, 'This is what we want to do,' because anybody can do that; it's not interesting. They've got digital and the computer; it's not taking pictures, it's not magic - it's a picture done by committee.
- I didn't know I was going to live for 50 years. It has come as a shock.
