- When you record and tour year after year without a break, it starts to feel like you're on an assembly line.

- Individuality is a personal thing. It's based on your own personal feelings and expression of self. So, really, it's nobody's business to judge you but yourself. And if you feel that you're expressing yourself as an individual, and you feel confident in it, then that really should be all that matters.

- 'Savior Of Nothing' calls out the would-be social justice warriors of the world who become so enveloped in fighting so passionately that they become exactly what they're trying to correct. They preach acceptance so much they become unaccepting.

- We've always used that as a goal - the record that literally every single track on it could be a hit. A record that breaks doors down, that opens up new opportunities to us, that helps you achieve true immortality as an artist.
- The first record I ever bought was Kiss's 'Destroyer.' And those classic bands like Black Sabbath were my first loves.
- Other music that 'Ride The Lightning' led me to discover was to start really kind of sinking my teeth into some of the thrash of the era that I literally had no exposure to - whether it was Slayer, whether it was Testament, whether it was Megadeth. It was the opening of a doorway, for me, to a whole new palette of music.

- I in no way, shape, or form envision myself as the modern-day Ozzy Osbourne - nobody can.

- I think there's no truer and more pure purpose than to be able to refine your art to a point where you feel it's as possible as it can be.
- I think that we're more united than the media would care to admit. We're not as divided as the perception would relay - not in the United States, not anywhere, really, in the world.
- We never enter the studio unless we feel like, right now, if these are the songs we record, that we would have an album that we're proud of and we're excited about. And we put everything under the microscope and examine it the best we can to make sure that we're prepared.

- The level of study that I was at, I was probably only about two or three years away from being ordained as a rabbi, so I really needed to figure out in my head where I wanted to go with things. And I just couldn't do it habitually anymore.

- At the end of the day, what people want from me is to get up there on that stage and make them feel powerful and give them a release for an hour and a half or two hours every once in a while. And if I'm still able to do that, hopefully I'm still making people happy.

- I can't deny the impact of, obviously, becoming a father and having my son come into this world, and even becoming a husband. The irony is that, when people think that in certain ways it softens you, in many ways, I'm more defensive and more on guard and more frightened and more angry at everything in this world now that I have them to worry about.
- All I can ever hope to be to my son is someone who's supportive, someone who listens and understands and points out possible other ways of thinking, ways of feeling, ways of approaching things, suggests rather than demands.
- It used to be that, whenever I walked around without my old piercings, that I was very rarely recognized - it wasn't a common thing; I could be somewhat incognito.
- I think that there's always a time to be tongue-in-cheek, and there's always time for humor, but there's a time to be serious and a time for emotional content.
- I support the troops with every fiber of my being. I don't support them having their lives wasted.

- I attended five different Jewish day schools as a teenager. I mean, I was trained as a hazan!
- I'm a fan of Genesis prior to Phil Collins. I don't really like Phil.
- Every time we put out a piece of art, it continues to define who we are. What could possibly be more important than that and require more of your focus and your time and your energy.
- Obviously, what happened from the 'Immortalized' record was we achieved a level of success that, to be perfectly honest, was unpredecented in our career. Every track released from that record ended up going No. 1 at radio.

- I always feel it's not a parent's role to either allow or to deny, but merely to guide.

- There'd be no merit to replicating something, to repeating something. As artists and as musicians, you wanna continue to go in different directions and develop.

- Even though there is obviously a marked stylistic difference between the majority of our catalog and a cover like 'The Sound Of Silence,' it certainly isn't the first time we've done an acoustic track.
- I'm pretty much done with political commentary. I've said everything I could possibly say. I've been a big mouth for long enough.
- Social media has become a high school playground where the challenge is what idiot can come up with the best insult, and do you end up congratulating them for it?
- Every politician, in order to be a politician, has to be adept at the art of one and one thing only, and that is lying.
- I've been blessed with a platform and a voice, and I owe it to myself and my family and our people to use it responsibly.
- There's still anti-Semitism everywhere, and unfortunately, what has happened with our people no longer being the underdogs in this region, peoples' perception of Israel has changed dramatically.
- You have to decide what's important to you. For instance, myself, I mean, I lead a very, very straight-edge sort of lifestyle on the road.
