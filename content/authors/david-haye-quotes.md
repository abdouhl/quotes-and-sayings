- Bernard Hopkins is one of my idols.
- That's what I actually like about boxing: no matter how well you do, you can still have a normal life.
- Money talks at the end of the day.
- Boxing fans are a very cynical bunch.
- I'm going to be a movie star, break Hollywood.
- I'm too fast, too sexy, and too talented to be blown away by a large, slow robot from the Ukraine.
- Everybody wants me to finally close the curtain on the joke that is the Audley Harrison show.
- There is no room for sentiment in a boxing ring.
- Just before a fight, as the ring empties, you can feel it. There is danger and loneliness all around you. Soon it's just the three of you in there: the referee, your opponent, and you. You're in a very lonely moment then. But, strangely, that's when I feel most comfortable. The ring becomes my office, and I go to work.
- I have the heart of lion.
- Maybe Tony Bellew is my Benn-Eubank.
- When someone unloads on me, I keep my head moving; I don't freeze. I punch back with them. The occasion never gets to me. Not one bit. I enjoy it.
- I'm good at keeping on top of my emotions and not letting them influence the fight.
- Fight fans just want to see the best against the best - if only it was that simple.
- It would be nice to crack America, but I need the opponent to do that. If Eddie Chambers is the best American heavyweight they can dig up, it's a very sad state of affairs.
- Every boxer needs to be able to punch, but none more than me, and that's because I'm not that skilful, and I'm one of the smallest heavyweights you'll ever see.
- I eat tall, chinny, Eastern European heavyweights for breakfast.
- My performance against Ruiz was a good one - there were plenty of knockdowns, excitement, and drama.
- It's the warm-up in the changing room when I switch on. I don't even think about the fight until then. Some fighters are bouncing about the walls, but I switch off. Then it's like someone flicks a switch in me.
- I want to leave a legacy, but to do that, I need to be on my best game.
- Fighting in Germany, Wladimir Klitschko makes so much money for everyone.
- The bigger the pressure, the sharper I am, the more in tune with my body I am, the better my tactics seem to be. A lot of people crumble under pressure; they do something crazy.
- The Hayemaker is a dangerous fellow who, when the bell rings, is on a seek and destroy mission, by any means necessary. No playing around. No comedy. It's just straight-up business.
- To beat Wladimir Klitschko, I have to be better than I've ever been.
- I've had injuries before. They are just obstacles to overcome.
- I've been in the ring with the Bronze Bomber, Deontay Wilder. I've tasted his power, and he's tasted mine.
- I've got three Bentleys, a couple of Mercs, and two Range Rovers.
- I'd like to be one of the ones who got out on his own terms.
- I want to fight who the fans who want me to fight.
- Chisora's not a nice man, not a nice human being.
- When I'm training, I use heavier crepe for wraps, for protection - but you're not allowed to use them in competition. So when it comes to the fight, the wraps are softer.
- My son's dream is to win Wimbledon - I'd love that.
- I've had a lot of good nights, and ideally, I don't want to be remembered for a bad night.
- Whenever the Klitschkos pick opponents who punch back, things go pear-shaped for them.
- Arturo Gatti-Micky Ward. Joe Frazier-Muhammad Ali. You get these rivalries in boxing - not that often, so when you do get them, why do you want to sanitise it?
- The whole idea behind going ahead with this Chisora fight was that a victory may then lead to a fight with Vitali Klitschko.
- You can't hit someone if they're holding on to you.
- I want to knock out both Wladimir and Vitali Klitschko, and I don't care what order they fall in.
- Fury said he would rather fight his cousin than me.
- It's always my plan to knock out my opponents.
- Look what the Rumble in the Jungle did for Zaire. No one had ever heard of Zaire until then. After Muhammad Ali fought George Foreman for the title, no one forgets it.
- It makes absolutely no sense for me to turn down a fight I desperately want.
- Muhammad Ali is my hero. Yes, he was the best boxer in the world, but he also put himself on the line. He talked when black Americans had to be quiet.
- The boxing public aren't interested in knowing me. They want to know The Hayemaker, the one who gives it big.
- The Klitschkos don't care about being great fighters, whereas I do. They may be big in Switzerland, but so are yodellers, and nobody wants to watch them fight.
- In the lead-up to fights, I'm very relaxed, very calm.
- A lot of people say, 'OK, I'm overweight, so I'm not going to eat any food; I'm only going to have an apple a day,' but then your body will go into starvation mode, so what you've got to do is increase your metabolism.
- I've got a really canny knack for avoiding big punches or clean punches.
- I would love to have gone there, fight at Madison Square Garden or a casino in Las Vegas, but there are no American heavyweights now who can pose a challenge to me.
- You need to stay hungry and not allow someone like John Ruiz to come over and mess you up in front of all your fans.
- It's hard to judge somebody before or after a fight. Adrenaline is flowing, and you're hyped up.
- It's boxing. It's about getting people interested. If I didn't say some stupid things from time to time, there wouldn't be that many people interested in me. But I let my fists do the talking when the bell rings.
- There are a lot of fighters, when I fight them, they stay hit forever and never fight again.
- Even on one leg, I thought I could knock Tony Bellew out. I was gutted when Shane McGuigan threw the towel in.
- Once you share a ring with someone, go to war with someone... you have a different type of respect for someone.
- Although boxing is a sport, it's still entertainment. You've still got the fear, press conferences, the stare-downs. It's all an act in some ways. My whole life I've been doing it. I love this side of boxing - as much as the actual fight.
- There are no shortcut to losing weight. Just hard work and dedication, hard work and dedication.
- It's sad to see boxers sometimes when they've come from these massive highs with thousands of people screaming for them. They're the best at what they do - then, that's it: stopped, finished.
- I always told everyone I'd be heavyweight champion of the world one day. They'd say, 'All right, whatever.' I said, 'OK, you'll see.'
- I am not interested in fighting against 50 wimps like the Klitschkos do.
- You get these young kids who are training their whole life to go to the Olympics. To go there and not fight someone else like them but fight someone who has might won an Olympics before, been a world champion, and is just coming back to fight some kids, I think is insane.
- Mark de Mori is a solid operator.
- It was always about being first, about winning. There were no prizes for second place. My mother and father said, 'Do whatever you want, as long as you're the best at it.'
- Slowly but surely, as time goes on, people forget about you. People stop talking about you. You stop seeing your name in the papers. I like to believe that I don't think that will bother me. As long as I know I've achieved my goals and people believe I'm the best at what I do, then I'll be happy.
- If I didn't have a great right hook, the bigger, heavier fighters would grind me down and smother me.
- There are probably one million dudes in America called Kevin Johnson, and beating one of them doesn't make you an all-time great heavyweight.
- Even though he's a moron, I supported Tyson Fury.
- You can't fight if you're nervous.
- I always fight better when my opponent's angry.
- In 2000, I got stuck in the sea off Cyprus after I fell off a boat. I was out there for over an hour. I am not a strong swimmer, but adrenaline kicked in, and I swam back.
- I love watching reruns of 'Sex And The City.'
- No one's going to hold your hand in the boxing business. And the people who do end up ripping you off.
- Nobody will hold it against him if he cancels the fight with Dereck Chisora - the public aren't interested in that fight; nobody knows who he is. It is pretty sad but shows the mindset of Wladimir Klitschko and why he will go down in history as a heavyweight who just fought the worst possible people out there.
- I spent more than Â£150,000 on a limited-edition Mercedes SL.
- Only time will tell whether the Klitschkos need me more than I need them. They won't believe that. But it depends what they want out of boxing. If they want guaranteed easy victories, then they can do what they've always done, but if they want a tough challenge, you'd think they would want to beat down my door.
- If I hit the Klitschkos with the same shots I was hitting John Ruiz, both of them would go over.
- I was born with a black eye. When they pulled me out with the forceps, they clamped them round my face, so I had a big bruise from that.
- Winning the title then losing it to John Ruiz... I'd be devastated.
- One thing you can guarantee with the Travellers, they've got a lot of heart.
- What I want to achieve in boxing is worldwide. I want to show I'm not just a British commodity... To do that, you have to fight the best and fight all over the world.
- Whatever any boxer does in the ring, I don't think any reporter should call him a coward. Anyone who does that I lose complete respect for. There's a difference between being a coward and being scared, or apprehensive. Different fighters have got different mentalities.
- I definitely believe if you give me any part of your chin, you are going to sleep.
- Anything's possible if you set your heart on something, no matter how big and how crazy it seems.
- I'm a showman.
- I've never been to Ukraine, but I have heard it's very dangerous for a black man. There are crazy racists who have already sent me death threats.
- Once I have beaten Mormeck, I don't feel there'll be anything left to prove. After winning the world title, I will be recognised as the No. 1 cruiserweight in the world.
- If you ever need a good steak, Stringfellows is the place to go in London.
- I want to have the same success in my acting career as I did in my boxing career.
- When I first went to Fitzroy Lodge, I said I was going to be heavyweight champion of the world and retire when I was 30. This is when I was 10.
- I have always maintained you should be able to bench press and deadlift at least twice your body weight.
- I would fight till I'm dead. This is why I am here. I am put on Earth to fight. I feel it deep in my waters.
- It's often my opponent's plan to take me into the later rounds, but the amount of damage that has accumulated on them means they don't hear the final bell.
- I've got good genes. My dad was a martial arts instructor - and he was good.
- People say, 'Where do you get your strength from?' Well, where does an ape get his strength from? They are 20 times stronger than humans, and they don't rely on a meat-based diet. They eat plants all day long. It's a myth that you need meat for strength.
- To me, being heavyweight world champion and Olympic sprint champion are the two greatest prizes in sport.
- My punching power passes any other heavyweight.
- I've got no desire to fight Dereck Chisora inside the ring or outside the ring.
- No flipping tables over any more for me.
- I seem to get the best out of myself when the pressure's on. My senses are heightened. I feel sharper. I do better things.
- I was actually very fortunate. I think I was actually the only kid in my class at one stage that actually had a father in the home.
