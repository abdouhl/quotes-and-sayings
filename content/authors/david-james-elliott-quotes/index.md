- I've always been fairly reserved and laid-back.
- But I do enjoy the freedom of doing a movie and then having some time off.
- Usually in fist fights you get punched in the face.
- I've never made choices based on money - I always trust my gut.
- I worked with a man named Patty Crane who was Errol Flynn's stand-in back in the '30s in Hollywood.

- I remember on 'JAG,' Joe Jackson punched Stephen Culp and shattered his nose.
