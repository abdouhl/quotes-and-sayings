- Sometimes when I hear my voice on tape, I'm like, 'Who is that horrible man?'
- You try things on in life. You wear them for a while, and you see what's next.
- I'm compelled to paint nearly every day. I just felt like making a painting, went out and bought paints and a canvas. Now it fulfills me creatively when I'm not doing music: it's something you can do by yourself and it's totally yours. It's a great adjunct to my life.

- Playing music is the best thing in the world. It makes show business almost bearable.
- I'm not impersonating anybody. I'm perfectly satisfied with what I am.
- You know, when you're making a record, you come up with 15, 20 songs. Then they start to fall by the wayside as your interest wanes. It's kind of like a process of elimination to determine which songs wind up on the record.
- I've been around the block a couple of times, and the guy I am now is the guy I like to be.
- I'm afraid of me.
- We thought that's the way you were supposed to be if you were in a rock 'n' roll band. Flamboyant.
- You know when you read that someone has to leave a show or a tour because they had 'nervous exhaustion'? Well, I had one of those and discovered that I was quite close to death. I always assumed that my lifestyle was going to take me at an early age, but when it was actually occurring I was, 'Not yet!' I pulled back.
- I've been tired since I was 15.
- I listen to a lot of different kinds of music.
- When I was a kid, I had some Charles Lloyd records.
- Sometimes I've found that by getting into a certain drag, or a certain feeling, you can cast off your mortal coil and really do something. I don't know if it's important, but it's something. It's entertainment.
- Most bands are commercial enterprises. But I'm not in one of those bands.
- As I recall, my life as a child was so all-consuming that I barely had time to consider the future.
- The first Latin music that blew my mind was bumba, which was a Puerto Rican beat.
- Music is my love and to me acting is more mercenary. I don't pound the pavements for roles: if it happens, it happens. I hate that auditioning thing.
- In the late '70s, I had a band - the David Johansen band, for lack of a better name - and I started collecting, not records, but tapes from people I knew who had jump-blues records.
- I still do a lot of shows with Brian Koonin, but we haven't had a full band lately.
- My father was a Norwegian tenor and my mother a New York Irish librarian.
- I don't know why I'm alive but I know there's a reason for it.
- Until I was six years old we lived in the projects, then my two brothers and three sisters and I moved to a three-bed that my mother's father built.
- I mean, if you asked me what I'm going to be doing when I'm 85, I'd make a quick picture in my mind and, well, I'll be singing.

- It's really a drag to do the same project over and over again.
- The stuff that I dig, it's usually got a soulful component to it. A singer that I really like. I might not understand the language that they're singing in, but I'm really communing with this person.
- I'm doing exactly what I want to do, and I'm having fun doing it.
