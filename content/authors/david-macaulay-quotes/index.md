- Making books is hard work. Some books are, of course, more demanding than others.
- I've never thought about the ages of my readers.
- I'm just looking for projects I enjoy.
- Occasionally, I just need to escape from my work or be reminded of the comparative bliss of my own life, so I pick up a novel.
- I'm a big fan of the digestive system.
- I went back to the notion of story, which is always a good thing to have if you're trying to get people to pay attention to a book and pick up information along the way.
- If you are lucky enough to be successful, you get drawn further in and you stop paying attention to the stuff that matters.
