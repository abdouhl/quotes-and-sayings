- I had proposed to HBO a series about the city cops in Rome at the time of Nero. What had interested me was the idea of order without law.

- Learning to live with the given is the great humbling educational process of life.

- When I was a kid, my dad used to take me out to the race track, and so many formative experiences have to do with associations like that.
- I've been beaten. I know what that's like. They say, 'Who has been a nail can learn to be a hammer.' So I know what it is to beat people.

- The idea of the western, I believe, as people conceive of it, is really an artifact of the Hays Production Code of the '20s and '30s, and it has really nothing to do with the West and much to do with the influence of middle-European Jews who had come out to Hollywood to present to America a sanitized heroic idea of what America was.
- In college, I started to get soaked in the materials. Subsequently, I worked with R.W.B.

In the course of that work, my interest in Faulkner deepened and has been sustained ever since.
- When I was working on 'Deadwood', it was understood that the script was a work in progress, and when we got to set, everyone would kind of work on it together.
- It's kind of an intuitive process. I wish that it were more systematic, but it just isn't.
- What constitutes - where are we when we sleep? What is our sense of reality at that moment? It's, you know, science now suggests to us that what has been perceived as matter for a long time is, in fact, energy.
- The truth is I try to show up each day available to do the work that God or whatever it is that's making, you know, the solar system work wants me to do. And I expect when he wants me to stop, I'll be the first to find out.

- When I was growing up, it was not the heyday of the western.
- A syndicate is a group that has gotten together to pool their money so they can cover more contingencies. If I come to track with, say, $200, and I join a syndicate of 20 people, each of whom can bet $200, we can spread our bets, and that gives us a better chance of winning.
- There is not an amount of money that a writer can earn that I can't blow.
- What part of 9/11 is big? If the future continues to reinterpret the past, it could be argued that 9/11 provides irrefutable proof that unless there is some other way that we learn to deal with our technology or deal with our brothers and sisters, it is goodbye as a species. That genie does not leave that bottle.

So they'll enter it for $40,000 so the horse looks like it's performed badly.
- In any operation, what you have to do is to persuade the patient to grant access to the patient's energy. The purest form of that is when you're trying to help a woman through labor: when you're saying, 'Push, push!' and you're rhythmically with the woman.
- Faulkner speaks to us on the questions of race, the challenges of modernity, and modern man's dilemma in all of its aspects. That he is able to specify among those and bring those themes alive is one of his great gifts. There are so many different kinds of pleasures one gets from encountering those materials.

- To think in terms of what the effect of a story is going to be, as opposed to trying to discover its inner logic, is one of the fundamental dangers in the process.
- The kind of flinching from any form of art or experience that PETA seems to advocate is ultimately life-hating.

- Faulkner wrote for film, and his ear is just impeccable.
