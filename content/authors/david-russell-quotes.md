- My father kind of had hopes that I was going to become an artist like him - the typical thing. Of course I could play guitar better than him when I was about 12. But I couldn't paint better than him. So I went, 'I'm going to be the guitarist of the house, not the painter.'
- If you have a piece by Bach, he often develops the piece to such a high level that you can hardly do much more to it. But Saint-Luc wrote very simple baroque music, and so if you do not embellish it, it just falls apart. It's way too simple.
- We live in a Newtonian world of Einsteinian physics ruled by Frankenstein logic.
- I don't try to make the guitar sound like the harpsichord or lute. That makes you end up being like a bad copy.
- The hardest thing in life to learn is which bridge to cross and which to burn.
- If the price is very cheap then it's almost certainly a fake.
- My parents are artists and they decided they would prefer to paint in the Mediterranean rather than in Scotland.
- Life to me is a journey - you never know what may be your next destination.
- I pluck with my fingernails. If I break a nail, I can't cancel a concert. So I can make a nail out of a ping-pong ball.
