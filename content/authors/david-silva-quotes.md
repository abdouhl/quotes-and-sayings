- Football in England is much more direct that in Spain - not just in terms of tactics or style but in the overall approach.
- I'm a very quiet person, and I always try to take the pressure off myself before games.
- The Premier League and the World Cup are equally important to me.
- The press often ask me about Messi and Ronaldo and who is the best, but one thing for me is very clear. For me, the No. 1 is Andres Iniesta, because he is my team-mate for Spain, and I can see that he is able to do even more difficult things on the pitch.
- Football is very simple for me.
- When you see Pep on TV or read his words in the newspaper, it is the portrait of a man who is the ultimate professional. But when you work with him, you don't just come to see him as a coach. You learn about his qualities as a man. It is that side of Pep Guardiola that the people on the outside don't get to see.
- I think you learn to value the important things in life.
- I love to play in the middle to be in contact with the ball all the time. I'm very happy to play in that position.
- At the end of the day, we're playing a sport.
- It's very difficult in England because the season is very long and hard compared to other places. There's not a lot of recovery time at all, not even a break at Christmas. You just have to do your best and get on with it.
- Why did I leave Valencia? Because the club needed me to. I was happy there and wouldn't have left, but the situation the club was in demanded it.

- I've always said that I'd like to play for Las Palmas - my local team.
- I enjoy creating goals more than scoring them.
- On the pitch, I have always had that responsibility to lead the team. But, of course, when you are captain, players, especially the young ones, they look at you more for the things you do on and off the pitch. But I have always been a very calm person.
- There is definitely a difference when you are fighting for a title against clubs like United or Real Madrid or Barcelona. They are so used to winning, it means that you have to have a different frame of mind when you challenge them because that's the only way to overcome them.
- Personally, I don't focus much about the statistics of goals and assists. I always want to improve, but I'm not worried about statistics.

- I know people say you have to be big and strong to play in the Premier League, but you cannot just judge a player by their size. You have to look at their other qualities, too.

- I am not too worried about not scoring many goals as long as someone else is.
- It's an honour for any player that a club of the prestige of Manchester United should follow them, and that, in itself, is enormous praise.
- Everyone has an image of a premature child, but until you live it and experience it, you just don't know how bad it is.

- I don't know what happens with other players or what is in their heads, but for me - just win.
- I'm very happy to be at City, and I would like to continue there for as long as possible. It obviously depends on my health, my quality on the pitch, and if the club want me to stay.
