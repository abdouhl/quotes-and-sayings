- The argument that there was a social pathology of the English Reformation, that there were fundamental changes in English society and the English church which made the Reformation inevitable, is academically stone dead.
- I wouldn't dream of commenting on Hilary Mantel as a novelist, frankly I'd be grateful if she stayed off my patch as a historian. She is intelligent, she is bright, she is an admirable writer. I happen to find her Tudor novels unreadable, but that's because I am a Tudor historian.
- Successful immigrants assimilate or become bi-cultural.
- If I'm relaxing, I'll make a proper cooked breakfast and very slowly drift into the day.
- Human beings enjoy the myth of romance.
- We have a lot to learn from the Tudor education system. It had diversity, placed rigorous demands on its students, and encouraged high achievement.
- Not to invent yourself is to be false. To follow preordained rules is a profound betrayal of what it means to be human.
- The Windsor monarchy is held in just awe. The whole process of criticism of the personal behaviour of the monarch is put in absolute suspense until about 1977, when it begins again.
- The whites have become black. A particular sort of violent, destructive, nihilistic gangster culture has become the fashion. Black and white, boy and girl operate in this language together. This language, which is wholly false, which is this Jamaican patois that has intruded in England.
- I've studied kings, so I'm very aware of the feet of clay of authority.
- Floating the idea that every kid in Brixton can become a whizkid at information technology is dishonest.
- I was a complete and typical only child. I was bookish, and sport was out of the question anyway. I had read all of Dickens and most of the volumes of Arthur Mee's Children's Encyclopedia by the time I was 11. The only time I was popular at school was the day I won the debating competition for my house.
- The wives of Henry VIII are too big to be left to chick lit. Their importance is the impact they have on the broad history of the period. On the lives of every man and every woman who lived in England then, and subsequently has lived in England.
- Churchill may have made some horrendous mistakes - Gallipoli, for one - but he had a sense of the profundity and integrity of the English experience. By contrast, Blair believes he excised the past in 1997, though what no one on the left seems to have realised is that his historic mission was to destroy the Labour party, not the Tories.
- I spent a lot of my infancy in hospital and actually started school in a wheelchair with this enormous plaster, and then into a surgical boot and callipers, none of which helps assimilation with other children.
- I've always been very good at obliterating the undesirable.
- If you make a book which is little more than putting a television script on the page, and add a few pictures, that would be a bad thing. But I would never do that because I happen to be very interested in language, in writing.
- I always bought pictures, I only started to buy oil paintings when I started to make serious amounts of money because they cost a serious amount of money.
- At the top, successful blacks, like David Lammy and Diane Abbot, have merged effortlessly into what continues to be a largely white elite: they have studied at Oxbridge and gone on to Oxbridge-style careers, such as that of an MP. But they have done so at the cost of losing much of their credibility with blacks on the street and in the ghettos.
- Since I was a child, I've gone to bed when things get too much. As a result, I have more trouble winding up than winding down in the morning. I need a second cup of coffee and then I potter around in a disgusting white towelling dressing gown for as long as possible.
- Academics aren't paid very much, but as a single gay man I was never badly off. You don't have kids. You don't have a non-working wife's insatiable demand for shoes or wallpaper.
- I believe young people need rules. They will respond to discipline.
- Unhappy marriages are big box office.
- The notion of public service has effectively been abandoned. Every political party now buys into business values, and into the notion that by definition business must run things more efficiently.
- I never snack apart from fruit such as Cox's apples.
- Programmes are like weeds - they spring up, grow quickly, and then should be allowed to die quickly.
- My father, Bob, was a sweet, gentle man who was prone to frustration. I hardly knew him as a child, but that was typical of those days. He got up early, came home late and wanted to be left alone.
- We should recognise that only around a third of the population can be in internationally competitive jobs. So we need to develop a middle-band craft economy like the one the French have so cleverly maintained.
- We are dangerously devaluing knowledge and learning by no longer having a requirement to remember anything at all.
- Historians have become far too precious. Their work has become ever more specialised and, as they steadily lose the context of their studies, they end up knowing more and more about less and less. It's a malaise that has now infected A-levels and GCSEs.
- In the early 60s, you read your essays to your supervisor rather than hand them in. I was both lazy and clever, and realised I didn't need to write essays at all, I could simply talk with some notes in front of me.
- Television is a performance, but apps actually reflect thought processes.
- When you look at the history of the monarchy, there's one period that stands out where it is held in universally, awe-inspired reverence and esteem. It's not Henry VIII, its certainly not Victoria; it's the first 70 years of the 20th century.
- I've always challenged authority.
- I've always had a naughty streak.
- It's very easy to front 'The Weakest Link;' it takes 10 minutes to prepare. But it takes three months to prepare an hour-long history programme.
- Our education system has been taken over by bean counters and narrow-mindedness.
- In the early 20th century the monarchy was held up as the archetypical virtuous British family. In the late 20th century it became the most wonderful symbol of the complete re-engineering of family structures.
- Only bad teachers lecture at a tutorial.
- The Tudors' is terrible history with no point. It's wrong for no purpose.
- I am passionately committed to state education.
- High malice is almost inherent in the profession of historian.
- It's not every day that you're the subject of direct personal attack from the Leader of Her Majesty's Opposition.
- Most of Britain is a monoculture. You think London is Britain, it isn't.
- I mean, really, compared to a senior civil servant, I'm very modestly paid!
- We have this extraordinarily unbalanced constitution, in which we have an elected dictatorship of the prime minister.
- My parents were Quaker, and they were part of that old self-improving working class.
- I was born in a council house, my father left school at the age of 11, had his teeth out without anaesthetic at the age of 22.
- Even austere, puritanical Cambridge of the Sixties was infinitely nicer and infinitely more attractive than the world I'd known before.
- I was outrageous on the 'Moral Maze.' The closest I sailed to the wind was when I almost outed a most saintly Cardinal in a talk on homosexuality in public life.
- Human life isn't about ideals. It's a compromise, and occasionally it's boring.
- I've got no problem with getting history wrong for a purpose - Shakespeare often got things wrong for a reason. But it's the randomised arrogance of ignorance of 'The Tudors.' Shame on the BBC for producing it.
- I'm not a delicate man.
- I spent a lot of time in hospitals as a child with these dreadful calliper things, and in push-chairs and God knows what else. I had no interest in sport and no ability at it, and so on. But on the other hand, I had a very powerful imaginative life.
- If you look at comparative figures, the last two episodes of 'Six Wives of Henry VIII' were watched by 4m. Graham Norton, who is very funny, gets 3m. Johnny Vaughan's comedy, which I have never seen but people say isn't very good, got less than half the viewers of 'Six Wives.'
- The notion that you can duff up a country for three months, pacify it for a bit longer and then miraculously transform it into a liberal democracy is just ludicrous. You might achieve some kind of democracy: it's the liberal bit I take issue with.
- The whole history of the 20th century can be written in an utterly fascinating way.
- It's one of the great mysteries to me how anybody who has ever believed in socialism can conceivably vote for Blair or New Labour, which is further to the right of any Tory government apart from that of John Major, and is taking privatisation into realms unheard-of.
- My relationship with my mother was unhealthily close. She was very supportive but wanted to fulfil her ambitions though me and was very reluctant to let go. She also hated my homosexuality.
- I went to a progressive primary school in Kendal, followed by a boys' grammar school and then Cambridge.
- You could say that my life since has been a sustained act of luxurious rebellion.
- The reign of Henry VIII is the axis around which England turns.
- The mere mention of domestic service brings some people out in spots of outrage, but there is a crying need for relatively low-level employment. It's ridiculous that people at the top are killing themselves in demanding jobs and then coming home to mow their own lawns.
- I started school in the autumn term of 1949 when there was a tomato glut. We had tomatoes in every form known to God, man or beast - and they were all equally detestable. When you pushed them with your fork, a warmish liquid spurted forth. It was rather like sort of bursting a boil.
- This is going to sound shocking, but being born with two club feet was quite a good beginning. If you pull through that, you're very unsentimental. My earliest memories are of really agonising pain.
- Delving into history is not an escape for me. I'm like a detective, sniffing for clues with a terrier-like excitement.
- What is striking is how the reputation of the monarchy has gone up and down in my lifetime.
- What Black Lives Matter is doing is a deliberate inversion of the proper processes of historical analysis. It is beginning with a conclusion. And it is adapting facts to that conclusion. You should begin with the facts and work forward to a conclusion.
- I could easily have spent one half of my life in a psychiatric hospital, and the other half in the Priory.
- The idea that it's only the young or people who've grown up with a technology who can appreciate it. Complete nonsense!
- I remain a very reluctant member of the Conservative Party. On the principle that one sort of ought to. Unfortunately, in 21st-century Britain I have no political home whatever. I get very sickened at the conventional right-wing label.
- Freedom of speech wasn't won by being nice, it has been won by struggle with religion.
- To footnote properly takes time.
- I hate niceness.
- Listen to David Lammy, an archetypal successful black man. If you turn the screen off so that you are listening to him on radio you would think he was white.
- My mother had been an incredibly bright kid but her family couldn't afford for her to stay in education. So she lived through me. She was a very remarkable woman and I owe a huge debt to her. She was unashamed about delighting in the fact that I was intelligent, and she drove and pushed me. She was also completely indifferent to popularity.
- One of the reasons Britain escaped the poisonous nonsense of Nazi Germany and Stalinist Russia is the sheer, absolute, middle-of-the-road, tedious banality of the House of Windsor. I don't want my politics to be passionate.
- If all the people of this country, black and white alike, are to enter fully into our national story, as I desperately hope they will, they must do so on terms of reciprocity.
- I tend to be a bit of a proselytiser for the importance of royal courts, but all politics - in fact every form of human organisation, and this is something that's so dreadful for all those brought up in the 60s - naturally reverts to monarchy. Newspapers have editors, companies have chief executives.
- We don't normally go on about the fact that Roman Catholics once upon a time didn't have the vote and weren't allowed to have their own churches because we had Catholic emancipation.
- I've written on Apple Macs since the early 80s - they're lovely to use and beautiful to look at.
- The notion that you have to hold something in your head seems to have been forgotten. It is an absurdity that children learn to investigate topics without having dates in their heads, or the facts.
- My mother scrubbed other people's floors for a living, and I remember vividly her worrying about being down to the last half crown for the week. And I was aware of it, and absolutely determined that under no circumstances would that ever happen to me.
- The BBC is in many ways wonderful, but it is not good at recognising when a programme has come to the end of its natural life.
- We really should stop taking historical novelists seriously as historians. The idea that they have authority is ludicrous. They are very good at imagining character: that's why the novels sell. They have no authority when it comes to the handling of historical sources. Full stop.
- Writing is a real activity conducted in real time.
- I was born a cripple, with two club feet, and mild polio in the left leg. I was in orthopaedic boots right through to my teenage years and, unfortunately, the fashion then was for light shoes. I discovered very quickly that I had a sharp mind and an exceedingly sharp tongue.
- I'm not a completely envy-free zone - I envy 25-year-old men with magnificent bodies - but when I look at my colleagues on the whole, I don't think I have much to envy!
- What I love doing is creating a room, with attractive paintings and colours and furnishings - very much my mother.
- Above all, it was the style of Quakerism I was brought up with - an aggressive contempt for popular opinion. The assumption is that most people think something that is wrong, which is great.
- Why would you want to drape yourself in the trappings of marriage?
- Family really meant almost nothing to me for many years but then, to my enormous surprise, when I met my partner James I found myself re-engaging and re-connecting. My mother died in 1977 but I got to know my father as an adult, and he got on well with James. A rapprochement with my whole family followed.
- My father was a trained engineer who got his qualifications at night school.
- The food of my childhood was revolting because I was a child of rationing. However, I still managed to be a very plump child and, indeed, as a teenager, positively fat. In my early twenties I lost three stone in one summer using the only diet that works: the pure protein diet. I kept to it until I was about 50.
- In the same way that I've no desire to live in earlier historical periods, I never touch historical recipes. Most historical cooking is detestable.
- I organise my work in the form of a daily diary. Each chapter is strictly chronological but is also monothematic - say, a war, a set of peace negotiations, a joust.
- The use of computers and other mobile devices has to be so carefully controlled. As we discovered with 'Dream School' rather awkwardly, it can become a source of total disruption that destroys the co-operative learning experience.
- Walking is central to my relaxation because when I'm writing I'm stationary for seven hours at a time.
- I'm a kind of double-breasted rebel in that I've always believed the important thing is that generations react against one another. For instance, there was always something oddly creative about the fact that Hanoverian sons hated their fathers so much.
- I enjoy cooking, but stick to modern dishes.
