- I'm just a little artsy-fartsy computer dude.
- It would be cool to custom-write music for some kind of story. That'd be cool.
- I do this sort of thing where, even for my own shows, I like to supply my own fingerprint of creativity. Not just ideas, technical things: offering model data, creating visuals for my stage show myself, babysitting renders, learning that technology as I go. That's what makes me feel like an artist.
- I'd like to think I wouldn't get booed off stage if I chose not to wear the head - I did gigs prior to having the head made and never had any problems. I'm aware though that, as a gimmick, it can create its own little monster as a brand.
- I'm not a DJ. I play live and think we put on a show. That's it.
- Disco evolved into Chicago warehouse. Then there was techno; eventually, it evolved into EDM.
- God bless Skrillex. I love the kid, but he puts out a new video, what, every four weeks? I'm like the Dos Equis guy. I don't normally do music videos, but when I do, I go big.
- Creamfields is, without doubt, 1 of the highlights of year for me. I really can't wait to come back.
- I am very strict on what products I want to associate myself with, and I felt that some things were just to make a buck.
- I really had no aspirations for becoming a DJ, and now I find myself having to campaign to be in the DJ Top 100.
- I get anxiety from a noise or some scuffling at the side of the stage. I hear stories all the time, from as minor as Dillon Francis getting smacked in the head with a flying beer can to Dimebag Darrell.
- I have a very varied taste in music from Boards of Canada to Radiohead. So I just love making music and being in the studio.
- I don't think anyone's career is so big that they can't know where their major synchs are or where their publishing is going.
- The label does what's good for the label. Always.
- I didn't come up as a DJ, so I don't play by DJ rules.
- I was a bandwagon jumper. If everybody in high school listened to it, so did I.
- I get to listen and enjoy music that is partially mine. Maybe influenced and guided. I created some simple outlines, but ultimately, I'm hearing a derivative work.
- The way I see EDM right now, it's a healthy industry for sure - minimal work for maximum profit.
- EDM is, like... Event-Driven Marketing, I think, is the acronym there. It reminds me a lot of disco. That had some hang-time, like, 10, 15, 17 years tops... Not too many people are forward-thinking about electronic music. They're just kinda like, 'Now, now, now - do it, do it.'
- With my previous record deal, it'd be like, 'OK, so I have this track then, EMI - do you know any singers, maybe? Do you have any singers on your little label there?' And funnily enough, they didn't. But I prefer finding unknown singers myself anyway.
- I've always wanted to go into film scoring.
- Virtual reality, to me, seems to have a number of different tiers. Entry-level-tier VR is this experience: on a phone, some simple head-tracking, and some quick and dirty, game-engine-quality stuff.
- You have to have a certain amount of grit in your sound, and having real synths and talking certain elements outside your computer can help with this.
- I'm a video game enthusiast. I love video games! They were a huge part of my upbringing in their early form, when I was all about 'Dig Dug' and 'River Raid.' As they evolved, so did my music-making, and we just kind of grew up together like cool friends.
- I'm exploring this world of game development and GPU and getting involved in any capacity that I can to meet talented artists and programmers and developers. That's what you're gonna need to get a high-end experience done.
- I was just trickling releases out slowly and building the Deadmau5 brand slowly. There was never this big marketing machine behind it or anything like that.
- I really like the grittiness of early Amon Tobin - I'm a huge fan of his old music, and I tried to borrow from it, not emulate it. I don't love my own original work.
- The industry has always had a problem with the 18-to-25 market, but EDM is perfect - a unique identifier for a group in that mental and fiscal state; in their youth, but free to do whatever they want. We filled that void.
- If I had a nickel for every time someone asked, 'When are you doing an album?' My career is way too transparent to do say, 'Guess what - I've got 16 tracks you've never heard!'
- I have back-and-forth feelings about everything a lot - it's not limited to my albums.
- There are some guys out there who make great music who may or may not be super-emotionally attached to their work. To each their own.
- Nothing goes full-circle with music.
- Music is 80 percent fun and 20 percent work. Video games, for me, is all fun.
- Going out and being nice to the world at large doesn't make me feel good, so I replace that with things, with technology that does get me excited and does get my brain spinning, until one day it stops spinning, and then you can bury me.
- I do get freaked out sometimes. I have kids hop my fence, get into my back yard, and just start screaming at me.
- 'I Remember' was produced before the vocal. It's just another body of work in the long list of bodies of work.
- Everybody's all up on the EDM bandwagon now, because it's, like, another viable conduit for traditional pop music to ride for a bit so they can get out of their little stagnant pool and make a dance hit.
- Usually, companies, when they approach other people to do VR, they're like, 'We're gonna offer a virtual reality experience' - to me, that usually means they're gonna put a bunch of 360° cameras in a room, film something, and wrap the video in a sphere so you can head-track and look around. To me, that's not virtual reality. That's 360° video.
- I love watching professionals play more than I love sitting there 20 hours a day trying be a pro myself.
- When I'm working on something and need to take a little break, I'll go down and play some video games.
- I like to consider myself an all-rounder, and I'm not trying to be King of the Scene or anything. I'd like to do everything, from writing film scores to producing pop albums.
- I don't believe there's a cap on creativity and passion.
- I like to think of 'the studio' as a laboratory where I can go in, learn tricks, apply, revise, and release. I'd figure I had about the same emotional attachment to my craft as a guy over at NASA does over... NASA stuff.
- There are some great songs - like, I really like 'Snowcone' and 'Whelk Then' and 'No Problem.' I think I'm dissatisfied that it's not written from start to finish; it's over a year's worth of work that doesn't correlate.
- I'd be pretty saddened to hear anyone say, 'Yeah, listen to this... God, I'm awesome, the way this all sits together,' about their own work.
- I've got $130 million in the bank and a whiteboard full of cool ideas for emerging markets and technologies where we're gonna test the waters and see what happens.
