- Most bad behaviour comes from insecurity.
- I was never afraid of failure after that because, I think, coming that close to death you get kissed. With the years, the actual experience of course fades, but the flavor of it doesn't. I just had a real sense of what choice do I have but to live fully?

- You see people on TV flying in to places just to pick up a baby, or brush some flies away. That's great if they can bring that issue to public attention. But that's not what I wanted to do. I was interested in committing to something that I could function in whether I was Debra Winger or not. Because nobody might care about that next week.
- But I never worried about having a child in my 40s, which is unusual - normally, I'm the queen of worry.
- I just want to sleep, and eat, and learn about what's going on in the world.

- I tend to wear outfits that match the walls.
- It's no secret that I didn't love 'An Officer And A Gentleman' then, and I certainly don't love it now, so at least no one could accuse me of being inconsistent.
- I have enjoyed a wonderful run in films, so far, and I may, at some point, come back. But it will be in my own time and in my own style.
- If you want to get a facelift, get a facelift. Don't sit there and talk about why you got it because of the pressure.

- There's a small club of women who are willing to age.
- When you connect with a cause, it's like falling in love.
- I don't believe in careers. I believe in work. I'm not interested in some 'big picture that would be really good for me'.
- I've been acting all along. I understand that I haven't been in people's viewers, but acting has never not been a part of my life, just more time in between and less high-profile.

- I will walk out on a scene if it's all lit and ready to go but it's not happening.
- Show me the story. I just want to tell a story that pulls me forward.
- Ultimately, however, the script an actor enlivens is someone else's words.
- I want to start a trend of women as we really look. Some good things, some not so good. I am tired of looking at frozen faces.
- Just because we're on schedule is no reason to shoot bad acting. Someone once said to me, 'You're inconsiderate.' And I said, 'Inconsiderate? Bad acting is the ultimate inconsideration.' It's a collective slap to a million faces at the same time.
- Granted there are only seven stories in the universe. And I agree with that. But give me a great variation of those stories. And literate.
- I used to love going on a junket and promoting a film when it was not a 24-hour news cycle, and when there weren't so many media outlets. You could actually talk about the film.

- I don't think it is worth trying to look 10 years younger through surgery.

- I do admit to being challenging, but it's always for the work, it's never personal. I will walk out on a scene if it's all lit and ready to go but it's not happening.
- Never say never, but the thought of electively cutting oneself is beyond my grasp, and I also object to it politically. Denying the lines on our faces makes a comment about age and wisdom I don't care to make.
- I was the all-American face. You name it, honey - American Dairy Milk, Metropolitan Life insurance, McDonald's, Burger King. The Face That Didn't Matter - that's what I called my face.

- I am lucky enough to be married to a guy who tells me I look beautiful every day.

- It's inconceivable to some people that that wouldn't be the sexiest thing to do in the whole world: to be a movie star, and make money, and be pampered, and whatever.

- In the early part of my life I carried the flame for fiery women: perky women who were not dumb.
- When I was younger I probably didn't understand something basic about tact, but I think it kept faint-hearted people at arm's distance and that's not such a bad thing, because life is short and I know the kind of people I want to work with.

- I had a very insightful friend who warned me back when I stopped reading scripts, 'It's easier to change directions while you're still moving.' If you stop, it's harder to get started again. I still don't think I made the wrong decision, but he was right.
- Bad acting is the ultimate inconsideration.
