- I love every minute of being at West Ham.
- At West Ham, I was the last person to be offered a scholarship. I remember an Under 18 match against Fulham. I was 16 and had to prove myself. Everyone else already had their scholarship. It was probably one of my best games. Knowing that every day I'd have to fight has made me into the person I am today.
- Growing up, John Terry was my obvious idol. I based my whole game on him.

- I have a special connection with the fans. It's unbelievable.
- I'm composed, and I'm a calm player.

- Mum and dad are always looking out for me; they just want the best for me.
- As I'm growing up, going into holding midfield, I'm watching Busquets quite a lot for Barcelona. The way he controls the game, his reading of it, technically, defensively - everything about him cuts him out above the rest. I'm really enjoying watching him.
- I've seen comparisons between myself and Bobby Moore. It's nice to be told there are similarities, but nobody will come close to him - what a player, what a man!
- I like Jorginho, the way he plays and passes.
- I have equal respect and love for both England and Ireland, and therefore, the national team I choose to represent is not a clear-cut, simple selection.

- People who troll you want a reaction, and there's no point in doing that. I just try to focus on my football.
- I thought I did well for only being 19 years old on the international scene. I was proud of myself.
- It's important to be vocal, and to be fair, I've always had that in me, to be honest. One of the things my dad has always said to me is make sure you're vocal, and before the game, I always get a text off him telling me to do the things well and again, 'Be vocal, Dec.'
- My pride at wearing the Irish shirt was always 100 per cent genuine. It was a great honour for myself and my family and something I will always cherish.
