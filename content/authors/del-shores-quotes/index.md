- With my work, I always want to people to just forget about anything stressful going on in their lives and be fully entertained. Laughter is key. If they shed a tear or go home thinking about the play, that's a bonus.
- I love my play 'The Trials and Tribulations Of A Trailer Trash Housewife' because I get these letters from all of these women who literally have left their spouses who were abusing them. You know, I'm just breaking up marriages right and left. But, that need to be broken up.
- I tell stories, and I do it through writing, through acting, through my stand-up, and through directing. All the hats I wear - producing as well - ultimately, I am a storyteller.
- Through the years, I have been overwhelmed by the number of people who have shared how much they relate to my 'Sordid Lives' family, and how many gay men and women used it to come out to their conservative families through the humor of the film.
- As a kid, I was always inspired by the comedy of Carol Burnett. I loved Dick Clair and Jenna McMahon's 'Mama's Family'.
- 'Sordid' is rather unique. That's why so many gay fans are comfortable to share 'Sordid Lives' with their families. It's not really a gay story. It's just much more a family story that happens to have gay members, which most people do.
- I don't discriminate against straight or gay people in casting; I'm open to good acting.
- I can't tell you how many letters I've gotten where someone showed 'Sordid Lives' to their mom, dad, or family and used it as a tool to come out.
- I started writing 'Southern Baptist Sissies' right after I had written the screenplay for 'Sordid Lives', so that's when I started on a darker path in telling the truth about my journey in the church, but there was still a lot of funny.
- Putting a face on a gay is important. We are just people.
- I love directing actors. In the last few years, I have started expanding my directing into workshops for actors who truly want to grow and learn. My mom was a high school drama teacher, and teaching makes me very happy. My workshops are nurturing.
- I was there in 2009 for the Matthew Shepard Foundation dinner. I was honored with an award - Making A Difference Award. It was a wonderful night.
- 'Queer as Folk' is gay gay gay gay gay.
- Not a day goes by where someone doesn't write me asking me for more 'Sordid Lives.'
- I have no regrets of fighting for four years to get 'Sordid Lives' on the small screen. It was a fantasy. I mean, I got to work with amazing actors like Rue McClanahan!
- If you cast the right actor, it not only compliments your work, it elevates your work.
- I came from the theatre, which had given me opportunities in television as well as a film adaptation of my second play 'Daddy's Dyin'... Who's Got The Will?' for MGM.
- I'd like to have one of my plays on Broadway.
- I consider myself a religious person, but when it comes to God and faith, I don't know. I guess that means I'm agnostic.
- Good southern boys always have this connection with their mom.
- I'm a gay man and a proud gay man and a loud gay man.
- So many kids are still sitting in pews being told they are not worthy of God's love. 'Sissies' will show them they are not alone, and I hope that healing will follow.
- In late 1999, I was walking down Ventura Boulevard in Sherman Oaks with my late producing partner Sharyn Lane after a day of editing 'Sordid Lives.' We passed the Psychic Book Store and decided to go in and get a reading. We weren't believers, but what the hell? We needed a sign.
- When I wrote 'Southern Baptist Sissies,' that was the first time that I really ventured out into pure drama with themes where there was not one laugh sometimes. But I've always gravitated organically to blending tones and usually get good reviews about that. That's what life is about.
