- I'm not going to do anything out my way to try to get somebody to watch me because I want to act a buffoon. I want to build a character that I want my kids to look up to.

- Unlike GGG, who just boxed Steve Rolls who was ranked about 81 in the world, I'm fighting real guys.

- I stay in the gym consistently.
- At the end of the day, there's a line full of people that want to fight Canelo and there's champions that maybe fought better opposition than me, but the reason why is because these people didn't want to fight me.
- Sulecki is no pushover. He ain't no Steve Rolls, ain't no Rocky Fielding.

- If the crowd wants me to go out there and bang out - and that's not something that I do - then they need to go watch somebody else.
- Akavov moved, he used the ring real well.
- Sulecki was a tough guy. He wasn't taking no for an answer. He came to fight, though, and I did what I had to do, and that's look pretty. Tall, black, handsome.
- When I get into the ring I need to show what I can do, not tell you what I'm gonna do.
- I want all the top guys, all the belts.
- I put my career and my life on the line every time I step in the ring.

- That's all we're looking to do, make great fights, baby. That's it. And may the best man win.
- Tony Harrison is definitely not Demetrius Andrade. Yes, he's probably a prospect and doing good things but everybody sounds good, everybody's a prospect until you get in there with somebody that knows how to fight.
- We don't control Canelo or Golden Boy.
- My name ain't Liam Smith, my name ain't Rocky Fielding, my name ain't Amir Khan, James Kirkland - it's Demetrius Andrade and it ain't no easy walk in the park.
- If someone wants to come and say hi and respect the work that I've done, I'm happy to meet them.
