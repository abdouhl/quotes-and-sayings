- I don't cry about results, I don't really care.
- To get a fighter like Usyk is a lie and for him to get a fighter to spar like me is a lie. I didn't need anyone to box like Usyk, what I wanted was southpaws to see the way they stand and the way they move their feet.
- Dillian Whyte hasn't got any power. He hit me with his best shot, didn't even bother me, and he knows that. I hit him with my best shot and he was asleep and I hit him with another one and I woke him up.
- We do everything for money.
- It's what you bring to the table for downloads and how many pay-per-views you can get. For an up and coming heavyweight, it's difficult to break into that scene. You have to take a pay cut.

- Everyone else who has fought the Klitschko brothers has been scared.
- I like to go to peoples backyards. I'm a better fight on the road than at home.
- If you could have had a fighter with David Price's body and my mind, you would have had the Great White Hope the United Kingdom has been waiting for for years. With my will in his body, we would have had this giant Scouser knocking everybody out.

- I grew up in Zimbabwe and we didn't have much. My dad worked away for the whole week as an engineer, came back on Friday with his pay and gave the rent money to my mum. He'd put aside money for food and stuff and he'd keep the rest. That's how Africans lived, but there was enough to go around.

- When you lose badly, when you get knocked out and the ref has to stop it, that's when you know it's been a bad fight. But when you lose a fight having over the 12 rounds and you don't look like you've done any rounds, that's when you know it's quite good.

- The title game is too hard.
- I'm a rude person. But men are hunters. We look. We like. We approach. Women don't like the fact I do it with a swagger. They don't like me walking into the room like I got a million dollars in my pocket, when I ain't. But as a boxer you need that swagger.

- An elephant is the king of the jungle for the simple reason a lion is only brave when there is loads of them.
- If you lose a fight you were paid £800,000 for, the next fight you'll get £100,000 so that's a big drop. If your ratings drop everything drops. I just want to make a good living for my daughter and the rest of my family and to enjoy life.
- I'm open to fighting anyone, whether it's Tyson Fury or Deontay Wilder.
