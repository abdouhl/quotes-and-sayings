- I went to a theater arts school, so I'm interested in many different projects, whether it be film, television or even live theater. I'm a performer. That's what I do. That's what I want to do.
- I think models in general have a certain insecurity about themselves because they're known for being beautiful, so they have to prove to everybody they have personality and they are intelligent.
- Whether it be through television, or through music, or through dance, or through film, whatever it is, as long as it's the right project that makes sense, then I'm all for it.
- For me, a dream partner is someone who is willing to learn and to put their trust in me.
- For me, I like to push myself... I hate feeling complacent or that I'm not learning.
- I feel fairly certain that my painting skills might not be best shown on 'Dancing with the Stars.' I'll have to come up with another way to showcase that side of me.
- I was kind of reflecting on my life and certain experiences, and you know, when I'm teaching and coaching my partners on 'Dancing With the Stars,' I sort of use those stories and anecdotes to help them sort of overcome certain fears.
- My type, which I didn't realize until somebody pointed out to me, apparently is brunettes with darker skin tones, but that is about it as far as aesthetically.
- I think for me, the thing that gets me in the right mindset is just watching something funny, something light, something that makes me feel good. Regardless of what it is - when you feel good, when you feel upbeat, creativity flows!
- When you're a choreographer and you put so much into a routine that's emotionally driven, those are like my ideas and my little babies that I have here and then I put them out there and they're there to be judged and looked at. When it's all over, it's just such a relief.
- I'm just the biggest klutz. That's the problem. I don't get hurt doing cool things.
- In school, some of my favorite subjects... I mean, art was my favorite subject. I loved art! I used to go during lunch time to the art room and paint or draw or something.
- Can someone's true value really be estimated? Maybe there needs to be an Edmunds.com for people on TV. That would be funny and possibly cruel.
- I want to choreograph, I want to direct, I want to act, I want to write music, I want to play music, I want to sing. For me, it's never-ending. I want to do it all, really.
- For me, there's nothing more masculine than when I'm completely in control of my body and can call upon my body to do whatever I want it to do.
- Whether I'm doing a routine where I want to move people, or if I want to feel moved myself, I definitely tap into those moments where it's not just dancing or movement. It might just be a hand gesture or just a slow look, or even just the way you slightly tip your head forward. These subtleties speak volumes.
- It's such a cliche thing to say. I want to choreograph, I want to direct, I want to act, I want to write music, I want to play music, I want to sing. For me, it's never-ending. I want to do it all, really.
- I'd like to do Broadway if the right project came along, but my mission in life is that I want to help change people's lives.
- I'd love to do more theatre and acting. I attended a performing arts high school in London, and it would be great to be able to put all of that training to use again.
- I'm all for big production - I love putting on shows.
- The key for me is really just to stay in a child-like state in the rehearsal studio. I'm really goofy and really silly and crazy. If I get too serious, I start hitting a wall.

- For me, you've got to start from within. The things you eat directly affect the way you feel and the way you move.
- I never dreamed of dancing on television or anything like that. It's more of things that come along that excite me and inspire me.
- I come from a theatrical background, where, if you're working on a movie or a play, you always respect the people you work with. You're accommodating.
