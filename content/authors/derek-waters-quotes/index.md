- My dream is to be able to make something in Baltimore that's just there. Make a movie or make a show there. I only left because there wasn't any opportunity except being an extra in Barry Levinson or John Waters movies.
- I don't want to be labeled one thing. My main thing I care about is being able to create the things I want to do with my friends, whatever platform that is.
- I love stories, and as I got older, I realized how important what happened yesterday is to how you try to make your present better.
- People are proud to be from Baltimore. In any industry you work in, you need support to survive. And this city has that support for anyone who was born here or lived here. And it also gives you the feeling, 'Oh, I stand for this place. And if I do something I'm not proud of, I might not make my town proud.' And I want to make Baltimore proud.
- I like discovering stories where I'm laughing and I'm learning. It's like, 'How was I never taught that in school?'
- I'm a comedy snob, and I never want anything that I do to get old.
