- A lot of actresses say they are 24 when they are 34 but I find that ridiculous. I wish we didn't succumb to the youth-is-all ideology in this industry, because there is a huge audience out there who want to relate to characters of their own age played by actors of their own age.

- I was always quite mature as a child and as I get older I'm regressing.
- I actually thought it was quite nice to feel that I could legitimately take up extra space and not have to apologise for doing so. It goes with the territory and I think you have to embrace your pregnancy otherwise you risk having a terrible time.

- As long as you're chasing something, that keeps you alive, right?

- There's a difference between loneliness and solitude. You pursue solitude, I think. But loneliness is a completely different isolating thing.
- I was a product of the late '70s and early '80s, so when we think of how we're so protective of our kids now, it's sad in a way. I guess what I'm trying to say is that we limit the development of our kids in a way.
- It's a collective experience when you're making TV. You think of all the people who work hard to make this extraordinary and you just hope that it works well.
- I think if you contribute to a job, and it's repeated and repeated, and sold over the world, and the producers are making millions, you should benefit from it.

- I am very scatty, I don't follow things through, I forget things. I am not perfect.
- My mother was a woman of the '50s who had a family in the '70s while finding her political and feminist voice. She could make marvellous three-course meals after teaching all day but hated it. Because of that legacy, it took me a long time to realise the delights of the family table.

- I've been very lucky with having a run of working with very special people and it just makes you work harder.
- Twenty or 30 years ago, certainly when my mother was my age, I'm sure she felt things were pretty over for her. You had your kids when you were 20. You brought them up. They left home. Then what do you do? While I feel genuinely optimistic. Well, I have no other choice.
- A lot of first-time mothers worry about how they will cope. But I'm more patient than I thought I would be even though there are good days and bad days.
