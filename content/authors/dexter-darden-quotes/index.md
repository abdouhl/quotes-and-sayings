- I love to see people laugh and put a smile on peoples' faces. Anytime I'm doing that I'm happy.
- I'm super into sneakers! I'm totally addicted. Just from playing ball all the time. I was always looking for the freshest kicks on the court.
- It's hard sometimes, especially with a book like 'Scorch Trials,' to truly adapt to the way the book is because so many of the scenes that take place in the book are really graphed and painted for the imagination. Trying to bring that to life is a really big task.
- I can watch cartoons all day!
- There are so many YA novels being made because there is so much young talent that can bring it to life. J-Law was one of the first females to do it with 'The Hunger Games,' and it's been going on for a while now. With J-Law, it was like, 'Hey, I'm Katniss,' and then, 'Hey, I just won an Oscar!'
- For sure, my sneakers gotta match my jacket.
- I think what makes 'Maze Runner' so unique is that it is a brotherhood. It's really about a group of boys. It's not really a love story - there's no love triangle, none of that. It's mostly about a brotherhood of boys who really don't know what's going on.
- I love to cook. My mom taught me to cook at a very, very young age.
- Everyone tells me I need to do comedy. It's never something that crossed my mind, but to be able to do a true comedy and make people laugh, that would be great.
- I listen to everything: hip hop, R&B, alternative, pop. I love JCole, so I'm always listening to him. Kendrick and Drake.
