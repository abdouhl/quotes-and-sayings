- I like playing a guy who wears pants as opposed to shorts.
- Really, voice-over is great. If it paid as much as on camera work, it's all I'd ever do.
- Doing animation is closer to pretending than anything else you get to do. It's much more like when you're a kid putting on a character.
- Working on a sitcom and improv improves your comedic chops. If you do it long enough, the one thing you learn to do is listen to the other characters.

- I remember how, when I lived in Paris, there was a McDonald's, and I'd always see Americans eating there and think, 'Why do they come all the way to Paris and eat at McDonald's?'
- When you're in Hollywood, you get sort of jaded about what you think the sense of humor of Hollywood is supposed to be, so you can't think outside the box.
- When I was a kid and we first moved to the states I used to watch 'Batman' all the time - with Adam West. I finally got to work with him years ago, and I totally geeked out.
