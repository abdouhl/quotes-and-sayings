- The key for me is to score goals and win trophies.
- I'd rather have someone who tells me straight up what happens rather than sweet things that I want to hear.
- It is not easy for me to pick out one goal or match as my favourite, but if I had to choose one Wembley memory, it would probably be my free-kick against Portsmouth in 2010.
- What worries me is to be in the best physical form to score goals.
- Jose Mourinho has been really clear about what he expects from me, saying he wants me working hard rather than just scoring. Hard work is what he values.
- Goals are what count for me. It's not about a battle with defenders. Fighting hard, giving everything and working hard on the field you have to combine with the goals you score. It doesn't matter if defenders want to battle with me or not; I will just be trying to do my job as well as I possibly can.
- I have to be extra careful, but I'm never going to change the way I play.
- I look back, and I know what I left behind in Lagarto when I pursued my own dream.

- Football is my life, and I cannot imagine myself doing anything other than playing this game.

- I don't like losing. I don't like to be in a losing position, and I show this a lot. I demonstrate on the pitch.
- My mindset is always to be victorious, to win the match.

- I want to be competitive; I want to run all over - I want to win.
