- Things are neither clear nor clean in the world of football right now and many people recognise this reality.

- In the end, it is about whether God wants us to be in the final, but I know that is what God wants. This time we will not need the Hand of God, because it is the will of God.
- If you don't want to play clean football then go up into the stands.
- At the moment there are some England players who are the stars of their club teams, but not for their country. It's difficult to explain.
- The problem is that they are all stars at Madrid. You need someone to carry the water to the well.
- If I could apologise and go back and change history I would do. But the goal is still a goal, Argentina became world champions and I was the best player in the world.
- While the coach is entitled to celebrate the team's victories, there is a manner and a way of doing so without aggravating the opponent.

- I have 23 top players and they are all ready to put on the jersey and work on the pitch and that makes you happy and then you have peace of mind.

- When I wear the national team shirt, its sole contact with my skin makes it stand on an end.
- There are hundreds of Beckhams playing football all over the world.
- I am Maradona, who makes goals, who makes mistakes. I can take it all, I have shoulders big enough to fight with everybody.
- When God decides its time, I guess he'll come for us.
- To see the ball, to run after it, makes me the happiest man in the world.
- Beckham is a nice man and I'm sure he will reach 100 appearances for England. But he is just a good player, nothing more.
- You can say a lot of things about me, but you can never say I don't take risks.
- Of course in the first matches you are more careful, perhaps more careful than you should be.
- All the people that criticised me should eat their words.
- When you win, you don't get carried away. But if you go step by step, with confidence, you can go far.
- I like English football, always have. It's just that people go on about the World Cup in 1986 and then I'm seen as the real bad boy.
- I certainly have an advantage over some because I can pass on so much from the World Cups I played in.
- God makes me play well. That is why I always make the sign of a cross when I walk out on to the pitch. I feel I would be betraying him if I didn't.

- I'll be too old to face a difficult championship as the one in America will surely be.
- I gave all I had. Now I want to enjoy my family.
- To see my country lose a football match is very hard for someone who has worn the shirt.
