- But acting is just something I do. It's not a passion like filmmaking is.
- Essentially, I am a lazy bum. I prefer lolling around, watching movies and yapping away to glory with my family and friends, when I have the time.
- All I am trying to do is communicate a story that I can visualize in my head, into something better for the audience. If that means paying attention to detail then that's what I will do.
- I enjoy humor with a poignant touch.
- I am not saying theatre release movies are restrictive. But I do not get certain 'freedoms' which 'Joji' gave me; I did not get those with both my earlier films.
- I find it difficult to direct myself in my films and so I avoid taking on any major roles in my films as I feel my judgement might be flawed.
- 'Joji' is a special film, the story will keep audiences hooked till the end.
- As a film-maker, I enjoy telling stories, and every film has its own journey.
- I've always been interested in the arts and chucked a science degree to study theatre and performance art because I was so enamored by it.
- I think I'm overrated as a director!
- I act because I find everything about cinema fun and exciting.
- A film released in a theatre needs to provide entertainment to more people. It is different with an OTT platform, not just in terms of audience size - it gives space to break more conventions.
- I have tried using spaces indoors in 'Thondimuthal'... In my view, 'Joji' is more limited in terms of the number of characters - in that sense the canvas could be considered limited.
- Cinema felt like a fantasy. It was like watching dreams unfold on the screen before me.
- There are two kinds of responses - the one we think we might get and the one we wish we get.
- I always wanted to be a director. And I make films that I like.
- I have great expectations about 'Trance.' It has been in the making for two years and we shot in Kanyakumari in Tamil Nadu, places in Kerala and in Mumbai.
- Directing is my first love; turning an actor was rather accidental.
- Sometimes, during a shoot, an actor might fail to turn up or there might be a need for an actor for a scene... and then if the director asks me, I step in front of the camera.
- The Malayali audience, which appreciates a good story or experiment, is our strength. They don't ask who is the star of a new film, they ask who is the director and writer.
- Clearly the encouragement I received after 'Mahesh...' helped in the making of 'Thondimuthalum.'
- From the 'get go', we were working within the limitations of the pandemic. The idea was to work around the situation, and that led us to 'Joji.'
- I don't believe that films can be compared to each other as each one is a work of art and deserves appreciation on its own merits.
- When I heard the stories of both my movies, I liked them. These are the kind of stories that I enjoy.
- In 'Maheshinte...' fight is the central aspect of the story - a man who is assaulted physically in front of his own townsfolk and how he fails miserably. Humiliated, fighting back his honor becomes the sole reason behind his existence.
- In each of our lives, there are certain moments that have the potential to change everything, depending on how we react. Those are the little stories that I'm trying to capture.
- I enjoy acting in all kinds of roles; it's only that I don't get the time to do all what is offered to me!
