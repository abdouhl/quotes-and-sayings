- When the media's around, I try to be careful. I don't want to make a mistake or use bad language, and I have to really concentrate because of the language barrier.
- I've always made a fool out of myself.
- Everybody has different tastes. Some people love Italian food; some don't.
- I was never the most confident man in the world.
- My whole first season was surreal. My first game was against Detlef Schrempf. There was German media everywhere. It was probably my worst NBA game. It was all a blur.
- I was never a great screen and roller, obviously.
- My dad never really played basketball, but now he's my biggest critic. I come home, and he says: 'Why didn't you shoot there? Why didn't you drive?'
- Over the years, I pride myself on being more than just a spot-up shooter. I've gotta put the ball on the floor. I've got to post up and drive the ball from the perimeter and get to the basket - all the stuff I was actually doing that helped us win the championship.
- I played all kinds of sports when I was young: tennis, handball, basketball, some soccer. I focused on basketball when I was 16 or 17 and then came to the U.S. when I was 20.
- I never looked at basketball as work. I always enjoyed it as my hobby. I loved it. Once that love is gone, and I'm tired of working out every day and doing all the stuff to get me ready for games, and I'm tired of lifting and conditioning and doing all that other stuff around it, and I'd rather stay in bed, then it's time to go.
- I love to play, and I love the sport, but I don't play it to gain popularity.

- Top of the key is my shot.
- Most of my game is not really based on explosiveness, but I've gotta have a little lift on my jumper.
- I came into this league when I was 20, and I didn't know if I was going to make it.
- I felt, when I was 20, I wasn't quite ready for the physical contact of 82 games. Mentally, it was tough. I forgot what city we were in most of the time. I can't even imagine going through it at 18 or 19.
- I want to see myself as a student. Keep learning, keep improving, keep your eyes and ears open.
- Obviously, sometimes in the summer, when you're by yourself in the gym, you lift, you run... it gets hard sometimes. It gets hard sometimes; I'm not going to lie.
- I started to play the guitar for a couple of years, which was fun. I still bring it out once in a while, could bust out a couple of songs, but I'm not very good at it.
- I'm not big on material things, but I like my cars. They are German-made and custom-made.
- The only advice I would give young guys is to keep your ears and eyes open. Never see yourself as a finished product.
- Corner is the easiest three in basketball.
- I've never faked an injury or an illness before.
- I always wanted to be a basketball player. Nothing more, nothing less.
- When you're older and get more experience, the game slows down for you. I know exactly what spot to get to where I can always get my shot off no matter who's guarding me.
- I understand you've got to go through tough times to get better.
- I think I can always shoot 3s. I think I can shoot 3s when I'm 60.

- I may not be the most physically tough player, but I think mentally I'm right up there.
- Money isn't something I play for. I want to compete. I want to win.
- I think different guys have different priorities. For me, it was always important to be in one spot, one city.
- You always want to improve, learn from the veterans on the team.
- When I think about my MVP season, I will also think about the loss to Golden State. But winning the award as Most Valuable Player of the NBA is just a huge honor. I didn't really realize how big it was until Mark Cuban had tears in his eyes at the award ceremony.
- Growing up, my idols were Lucky Luke and Jolly Jumper. And Scottie Pippen.
- Off the floor, I'm really laid back: like, nothing really fazes me too much. But on the floor, I do get emotional and a little carried away. However, I started playing when I was 13 to have fun with my teammates, and that never stopped. I enjoy traveling and having fun in the locker room with the guys. Life is too short to be miserable.
- I'm not trying to make a brand out of myself.
- I try to stay away, but In-N-Out, you just can't compare it. It's the best. It's the best. It's healthy fast food; they do their own meat and their own salad.
