- It feels like as you get a bit older, you've worked out the things that are good for your life apart from with acting.
- We want 'Doll & Em' to be something we're proud of. We'd love to do another series, but it's not the be-all and end-all. Our friendship is the be-all and end-all.
- Essentially, we wanted to be in one of Azazel's films, so the notion was we'd simply write an Azazel Jacobs movie ourselves, and then give it to him and be like, 'Right, here's you next film, now direct us. Go.'
- The idea that you've been friends for your whole life and then suddenly the other person becomes your job - it would be so weird. It would be hard not to become massively resentful.
- This is really bad to admit but, you know, when you put your name in Google to see how many credits it's got by your name or something. So you put in 'Dolly Wells' and suddenly it goes 'Dolly Wells Feet' or something.
- When Dad died in 1998, it really hit my confidence - he'd helped me write and he thought I was really funny, but since he'd died I didn't feel right. And it felt like no one but me even remembered him.
- We came up with this idea of a power struggle between two people who really love each other, and 'Doll & Em' took off. Calling it by our own names was the director's idea, but hopefully people will understand that we're playing versions of ourselves.
- My dad was an actor, so he would try and put me off and say, 'Come on, you've got to go to university first.'
- I love 'Curb Your Enthusiasm' and 'Extras' and also 'The Trip.' That had all the nuances of friendship and finding things out about their lives without it being too much plot-driven.
- Deep down, I feel 'Doll & Em' is a love letter to our dads, because we adored them.
- There is something very freeing about being anonymous because nothing is expected of you; nothing is getting back to anyone, and no one cares.
