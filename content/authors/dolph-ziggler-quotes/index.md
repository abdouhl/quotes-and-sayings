- You want to be an NXT fan.
- Growing up in Cleveland, the first time I went to a WWE event, Cleveland didn't even have an arena. The Cavaliers were playing at the Richfield Coliseum. I would go out there.
- I have no desire to switch companies or go to UFC or anything like that.
- I have a lot of downtime in airports and on flights.
- I, being the ham that I am, always want people looking at me.
- For the longest time, Cena would be, and still is, filibustered by half the WWE universe.
- The Cavaliers used to play at the Richfield Coliseum, and I actually went to see them when I was a little kid. Mark Price, Brad Daugherty, Larry Nance, all those guys.
- I've never been in the ring with The Undertaker.
- It's really funny to me that I get called a workhorse or somebody who's really good at making other people better in the ring. I feel like I'm good at every aspect of this. I feel like I'm a great talker; I feel like I'm a great representative of the company. I broke records in college. I have an amateur background with fighting skills.
- There is a glass ceiling for everybody until you find a way to get that connection that Cena has.
- For the longest time, I was in random cold matches for 30 minutes and tore the house down for no reason, and everyone complained, 'Why isn't he in some kind of a story?'
- I'd love to be in the ring with guys like Goldberg, Brock Lesnar, and The Undertaker, as, no matter what they've done, I know how good my conditioning is. If those three can say the same thing, I'd love to go and hang with them because I don't think they could hang with me.
- Miz and I grew up a couple of minutes apart in the Cleveland area and both had dreams of being WWE Superstars and being the best.
- When I was 5 years old, Hulk Hogan was the world to a lot of little kids.
- Though I'm not a huge fan of The Rock, I admit that I am a fan of the fact that he does his own thing. He gets excited on the mic. He yells. He didn't listen to what people told him to do, and people responded to that.
- It's the WWE; it's Vince McMahon's show. He lays out what he wants from you. It's not always going to be what I want.
- Little kids who get picked on and bullied can relate to the Lucha Dragons, who are smaller, but they're quick and exciting and never give up.
- You know what, I'm out there to give 100%, and I do what I think is best. I really don't care what other people think.
- After a while, you reach a certain point to where you know what your talent is, you know what you're capable of, and you have to not care.
- We are on the road 250-280 days a year at least, and it's something that, if I have a wife and kids at home, I don't know if I could do it.
- I know how good I am, and the fans know how good I am.
- You never know the opportunity you're going to get, and you're never going to know how good anyone can be without the best opportunities, just as it goes with time.
- I do have a personal life. I spend half of the week at home. One of those nights, I'll go out with some friends and have a good time. I have a day and a half at home, and love to just sit on my backyard by my pool, read a book, or do some writing. That's my vacation.
- If I have 30 seconds to make everyone remember what I do, I better make the most of it.
- I'm a huge fan of comedy. I write material whenever I can.
- When something special happens in wrestling, it's that much more special to me and for me to go, 'That was awesome,' because I'm as bitter as there is, so if you can get me to go, 'Woah, that was cool,' a couple of times, it's a special show.
- I'm a huge Jon Lovitz fan.
- When I was 8 years old, I watched 'Saturday Night Live,' and I always wanted to be on there and be an entertainer.
- Some advice I would give myself from the Spirit Squad years - try and get taller.
- I'm someone who loses 80 to 90 percent of the time. Even when I lost, I put my body on the line and I told the best story. If I stood out, if my attitude towards fighting was different, I found a way to stay around and keep revamping myself and my character.
- I want to know why people are getting laughs. Why this joke works and why that one didn't work. It all comes back to helping me be a better WWE Superstar. So I love it.
- When people are funny, I like to let them know that they're funny. There's so much negativity, it's cool to get some positivity out there.
- All of those Shield guys, who came in protected, have done nothing but deliver, in my opinion, and I am a harsh critic of everyone.
- I am not trying to be the next anyone - I am going to be the first Dolph Ziggler!
- I go out there to steal the show every night.
- I'm not going to be one of those guys who changes, and all of a sudden I'm shaking hands and kissing babies.
- I live to leave somebody with a positive experience when they've met me, and make someone smile for the day.
- Even though I only get a few days off, I do not stop, whether it's getting some stage time at an open mic or flying to L.A. to watch a ton of stand-up shows.
- I was a huge fan of Jon Lovitz, Dana Carvey, Jan Hooks, obviously Phil Hartman, and a very young Adam Sandler.
- Some people debut and beat John Cena. Some people debut and lose to R-Truth. That happened to me by count out. So, everything is different.
- When every new football season starts, we get all excited about the Browns. But no matter how bad they do, no matter how much they say they're rebuilding, they always have the support of that town behind them. No matter what, Cleveland is always behind the Browns, and we always root for them. One of these days, it's going to pay off!
- I'm always trying to make myself a better sports entertainer.
- I've always wanted to be the best at every aspect of the business. Not just someone who does great moves or high flying moves but every aspect and can take control of every match in case something goes wrong.
- People can pick and choose what they want out of it, but I feel like I'm a modern day Renaissance man of anything you could want me to do... except be six inches taller.
- I study entertainment and apply it to myself to one day become the greatest WWE superstar we have, and it's a lot of work. So I write jokes and material every day... you have to keep people's attention, one way or another.
- I have more respect for amateur wrestlers, especially collegiate ones, than anyone else. It's a gutsy sport with no real payoff except for knowing that you were better than someone else. It doesn't have big crowds, it doesn't have big money, but it is fun going one on one.
- My goal when I first started in the WWE was to stand out.
- My first time actually appearing in a match at SummerSlam was 2010, and I was wrestling against Rey Mysterio in the opening match of the show. I was pretty brand new as Dolph Ziggler, and obviously Rey Mysterio was a well known superstar.
- WWE has given me an out where, any days off that I have, they allow me to work on outside projects.
- I have always gone above and beyond, whether I've been given 30 seconds or 30 minutes, but at some point, you have to deliver and go to the next level.
- Whatever you do, take pride in it and be great at it.
- Dolph Ziggler is a name you'll remember. It will stand out, and you'll know it before you even meet me.
- The thing is, in the WWE, we have the WWE title, the World title, the United States title, the Intercontinental title, the Divas title, the Tag Team titles. And I feel like, in this business, when Mr. Perfect had that Intercontinental title, that was the belt we saw as the stepping stone to becoming 'the man.' The franchise of the WWE.
- I want to change the game and break through the nonsense without any Establishment help.
- On a good day, I'm a bitter, angry, chip-on-my-shoulder type of guy.
- When I was 5 years old, I wanted to be a WWE superstar.
- I'm from Cleveland, Ohio. And I'll tell you a real quick thing: we didn't have a pro hockey team when I was growing up, so I adopted the Red Wings as my hockey team just so I could, you know, be amused and enjoy playoff hockey every single year. I really get into it. Detroit is my team.
- I always kind of did my own thing, but it got me into trouble a lot, so I started listening to what people were telling me to do to show I was a team player.
- Winning the Intercontinental Title for the first time, in 2010, was a real milestone, as I grew up living off some of those Intercontinental Title matches.
- I do circuit training - different workouts without stopping. I like having that stamina, where I've never been too tired to put on a match or go above and beyond.
- When I finally get the chance to say what I want, to talk about where we're going from here on out, when my voice, my words, become the measuring stick for WWE, I think that's the moment that's going to reinvent our entire business.
- You want to be the best, and you hear a lot of good things about yourself, and then you find out that you're going to debut as a caddy - it's a little gut-wrenching, and it hurt.
- I don't eat anything before, but I can still go kill it at the gym and be in and out in 45 minutes or an hour, even doing workouts in the sauna to get the blood and sweat flowing.
- You don't just go to your bosses and say, 'This sucks. I'm supposed to be winning everything.' If you have an awesome idea or a story, or something great, you go, 'Hey, how about we do this,' but when the story is not you, you have to find a way to make it work.
- When you live life like The Nature Boy, there are some monumental highs and, sadly, some unbelievable lows. No matter what happens in his life, he always comes back bigger and better than any of us can even imagine.
- I wouldn't advocate anything to anybody - everybody's different. Some people can put on those toe shoes and think they're having a better work out than those in tennis shoes. Everybody can advocate their own way of doing something.
- I would love to make my entire career as the guy who did not get cheered. Of course, I'm still going to get cheered by people who think they're smart, and that's fine - they're acknowledging how good I am at my job - but I don't want cheers; I want the boos. I love it.
- If I was always doing my own thing, I would be bored out of my mind.
- A lot of people are successful in this business because of a catchphrase or athletic ability or charisma or wrestling; Ric Flair is the personification of all of those things, much like his daughter Charlotte, as she is already a multiple-time champion after only a few years in the WWE.
- I feel that I am better than Roman Reigns, but you know what? He hasn't wrestled as long as I have.
- Some people are fighting much, much more important battles and much bigger battles, and if we get the chance to put a smile on their face for ten seconds, it's so worth it.
- I've made it clear - I'm not patient at all - several times.
- It's not always about wins and losses, but winning two Survivor Series matches is something I will never forget.
- For the most part, and even with Miz, the WWE superstars are so good to the fans and everything they do.
- My dad used to work a night shift when I was five years old, so I would get up when he went to work and watch Johnny Carson. I remember not knowing what was going on, but loving it.
- I am never the favourite, but I live for that.
- I was a big fan of amateur wrestling, and I loved it and dedicated my whole life to it for 20-something years, and it's not really a glory-getting sport.
- I'm very adamant on social media about recommending comedians to people if they don't know them. I think it's so important to go see them.
- Nobody works harder than me in the ring; no one steals the show more often, and no one gets better reactions for a guy who's not even part of huge storylines.
- Of course, legends can call out whoever they want and do as they please, but they can't just show up and get handed matches.
- Getting the approval of Ric Flair is the wrestling world's version of Johnny Carson calling you over to the desk after you just crushed a standup set on 'The Tonight Show.'
- I get cheered more and more for one simple reason: When I step in the ring, I steal the show! I will not accept anything less from myself.
- I started wrestling when I was five. I lost my first match and cried in front of my dad, and I never wanted to do that again.
- Sting can call out whoever he wants; he's a legend in this business.
- I make sure to write every day, even if it's a little bit.
- I do what I do best - and that's take it away from every one else.
- WWE has no issues with my stand-up. I do not miss work for any reason and will continue to work around my schedule because I'm a professional and do not allow complacency or laziness.
- I dare you to put me in a back alley with Randy Orton or someone like that. I guarantee I'm not afraid of someone taller.
- Always a big fan of the Browns, of course. No wonder how bad they lost or how much we froze to death out there, we still went to the games to watch them lose.
- If I cannot be the best or operate at the best highest level, then I need to go away.
- Go to work every day, be the first one in and the last one to leave, and you'll know that you've done everything in your power to make your life better.
- You have to do something different, or you are just the guy who goes out there and has a great match, but nobody cares. You have to have different layers to your character.
- They love you when you're doing well and hate you when you're the bad guy.
- I was the World Champ, but I should be better.
- I appreciate someone who stands out and stands up for what he believes in, because that's what I'm trying to do.
- Any comparison to a WWE legend or someone I've looked up to is really cool, but make no mistake about it, my ego is too big to want to be a really good replica of someone else!
- Theoretically, the road to WrestleMania is like an election year. The Royal Rumble usually has 30 people in it, which narrows down to 4 and then finally two. Only one of them can go on to the main event.
- I hit an exercise - arms and legs, a set of curls, a set of tricep pushdowns, and then grab the bar and squat 40-20-30 and do it over again. I hit that a couple times through, then go in the sauna. I'll do a couple calf raises, then hop on a treadmill at 15 - the highest incline it can have while maintaining a fast-paced walk.
- That's always the goal. If you don't want to be the best or have the company on your back with everyone relying on you, then you shouldn't be here.
- I'm constantly unsatisfied with any situation, which is both good and bad, because never being fully happy drives me to better every day... but I don't enjoy the things that I do even when I do them great.
