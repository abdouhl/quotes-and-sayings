- I like films that deal with some of those questions that you can never answer: 'Why are we here? What's it about? What happens to us with the choices that we make? What are the ramifications for doing something right, or doing something wrong?' Those universal questions, I enjoy.
- Television is face acting, and film is eye acting.
- I never thought I could learn much from a dog or cat. They sleep when we sleep. They eat when we eat. I'm into observing animals being as wild as they can be in a captive environment.
- I've got a hectic schedule, but I wouldn't have my life any other way.
- If you woke up, every day, and someone punched you in the face, for the first week, you'd go, 'Why is someone punching me in the face?' But, by the time you got through week two, you'd take it and just go on with the day.
- I've worked on films where the budgets are almost limitless and you're in trailers that are bigger than a hotel room. You're taken care of and the food is amazing, the quality of the job is amazing and then you work on smaller things but it never dictates my happiness or my willingness to go to work.
- I'm a big fan of the misunderstood, the vilified, the underdog, the breaking of myths.
- When I go on holiday, I go to places that have animals I'm interested in.
- We're electrical items and when we die the electricity goes somewhere else. When we die our energy goes into the galaxy.
- I'm constantly exposing myself to art and that inspires me.
- I don't need to have three feather pillows in my trailer. I just don't work that way.

- I don't tend to go out that much.
- I'd love to play a gangster but I think people might say I looked a bit too young and cheeky to play a character who'd just blown someones head off!
- I've had a fair amount of experience with snakes, and I find them to be pretty honest in terms of how you read their body language and emotions. They'll tell you when they're grumpy. They'll tell you when they're okay.
- People have a fear of the unknown. Insects have different senses than us, different amount of limbs and their body structure is very different. It's hard for us to really relate to them and understand them.
- I think if you've held onto a character for several years and then you're getting rid of that character, it's going to be traumatic.
- I get involved with projects based on three parameters - the script, the actors involved and the director.
- Probably a concern to either a major or minor degree with most actors if they're really motivated to kind of make a significant difference in the business is the 'pigeon-holing' thing.
- What would it take for me to eat human flesh? If that was the only way to stay alive, I would. I would eat anything.
- I was never a big guy in pubs. I was never the main kind of aggressor or anything like that, but I found myself in trouble because I always had a mouth that would come back with something, and there was just never anyone who could make me be quiet.
- If I had a choice as to my perfect career, I would make a couple of films a year and then concentrate on natural history.
- What I'm attempting to do is to show people that if I can spend some time with very dangerous spiders and snakes and scorpions, then maybe they'll feel different about the spiders and snakes they find around their areas. I don't need people to keep them as pets. I just like them to be respectful and see that everything in nature has its place.
- I enjoy the preparatory elements of travel - packing my bags and choosing my outfits - but my favourite part is getting there.
- I could always flip between emotions and be available to suddenly do something new. I think it's a part of playing, and you hang onto it when you're a kid.

- I like relationships and being in love, but I also like being single - you have to embrace all those different things.
- I love having the opportunity to surf.
- Here's an interesting thing about L.A. - it's overrun with black widow spiders. I could find you one on the street in 10 minutes.
- I'm in this position where I can afford to wait, I'm lucky enough to be financially secure to not have to do anything that's thrown at me. You know the next couple of jobs are going to be pretty crucial in terms of how you're perceived by people. So I'm just waiting.
- I was the class clown so I was used to performing and fooling around in front of my friends.

- Holidays are all different depending on the company and time of your life.

- My ultimate search has been for a muse.
- I think we are all interested in end-times ideas and also in the current climate that we are all living in, where money is a little harder to come by, things continue to get expensive; gas prices are not too far from people's heads. There are more and more people. Human society's going to have real problems.
- If you look at little kids and wild animals, these are two groups of things that whenever I'm with them forces me to be in the moment.
- My brother's a teacher in Costa Rica and actually does a more important and significant job than I will ever do.
- My brain kind of rolls pretty fast when I'm conscious. It's constantly looking for stuff to do. Like if I'm in my house and I'm hanging out, I tend to be listening to music whilst watching a film whilst sending e-mails.
- I have a lot of respect for marriage.
- The term 'geek' for me is like you having a passion, interest in something that is unabashed and you don't care if people think it's not cool. You think it's cool and that's your thing.
- Obviously the idea of being human is a very human idea.
- I've learnt that the world over, everyone's essentially the same. We are all trying to have a nice time and get along with things.
- My mom and dad just loved the fact that I fooled around. They just embraced it. They'd always kind of enjoy it, and they liked it when I made them laugh.
- I think if you're an actor, then you can work on stage - but if you've never done it before, you're going to have picked up a few things that you're going to need to change when you're working on stage.

- I like learning new stuff, and continuing to educate myself as best I can.
- I think a lot of young kids at school are very conscious of trying to keep credibility in case they kind of stand out in a crowd and get bullied by trying to stay cool and stuff. And my whole thing, all the way through school, was I was just a goof... I didn't care.
- I'm a movie nut. I go to the movies probably twice a week, and if I'm not doing anything at night, I'm usually watching a movie or two.
