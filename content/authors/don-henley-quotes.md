- Selling eight million copies of your first album will mess you up.
- The Eagles ended on a rather abrupt note, although in retrospect I realize now that it had been ending for quite some time.
- Between each album I try to gain a new insight that I didn't have before and perhaps write a song about something that I've written about before, but from a fresh viewpoint.
- I'm always jotting things down on pieces of paper. I've got pieces of paper all over my house.
- Playing the drums hurts my back.
- Sometimes songwriters and singers forget that. They get a melody in their head and the notes will take precedence, so that they wind up forcing a word onto a melody. It doesn't ring true.
- I'm fortunate that I've been in this business long enough that I've earned the right to be left alone by my record company.
- A man with a briefcase can steal millions more than any man with a gun.
- I think my first instrument was a ukulele that they gave me. I used to know how to play that pretty well.
- It was pretty frightening because as we all know, when large, famous groups breakup, a lot of the members don't survive in solo careers.
- The Eagles and the critics were not the best of friends.
- I don't mind doing two or three Eagles songs and playing the drums. I'm not one of those artists who's going to sit here and deny the past.

- Sometimes you get the best light from a burning bridge.
- I played drums on Keith Carradine's first record.
- I'm certainly not thrilled with everything the Eagles did, but there are some things I'm quite proud of.
- Some records with drum machines on them sound phony and plastic. It all depends on how you use the tools.
- I could stand out front and sing Eagles songs that I sing in my set, but I think people enjoy watching me sing and play the drums. It seems to fascinate people. I don't know why.
- I don't care what anybody says about Ringo. I cut my rock-n-roll teeth listening to him.
- I try to write conversationally; I try to write like people speak and put the emphasis on the right syllable.
- I'm not on any crusade.
- I could have played more complex stuff. I could have been a busier player. But that's not what I wanted to do. I played what I wanted to play.
- Lawsuits should not be used to destroy a viable and independent distribution system. The solution lies in the marketplace and not the courtroom.
- Let hope inspire you, but let not idealism blind you. Don't look back, you can never look back.
- I have a bad back partially from playing the drums and singing. I used to have to hold my body in such a position that my spine got out of alignment.
- I have a certain pool of subject matter that I like to write about, things that interest me: politics, religion, ecology, and relationships between men and women. And that's usually what I focus on.
- I'm blessed with a pretty good voice. So just sitting back there banging on the tubs wasn't enough.
