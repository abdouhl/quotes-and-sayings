- Storytelling is not what I do for a living - it is how I do all that I do while I am living.
- I discovered that in a story I could safely dream any dream, hope any hope, go anywhere I pleased any time I pleased, fight any foe, win or lose, live or die. My stories created a safe experimental learning place.
- I didn't learn stories, I just absorbed them.
