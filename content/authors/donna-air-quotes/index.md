- My look is relaxed, and while I love fashion, I don't obsess about it. I don't have set rules when it comes to dressing, and I don't mind where my clothes are from.
- Some people think I can only do fancy; I don't know why. I'm a pretty easy person, really. Low maintenance. I get on with things, and I'm comfortable anywhere.
- I've spent a lot on clothes. I'm not kidding when I say I could have bought several country homes with the money. I've also given a lot away over time. I had a lovely Yves Saint Laurent jacket that I'd only worn once or twice, but I'm one for spring cleaning rather than storing my clothes.
- I don't stress about things I can't change, so if I have a day when I don't look great, I don't look in the mirror! I try to fit in one session of Bikram yoga and one run a week and, if I can, one swim, but that's pushing it.
- I am partial to a cartwheel or two. It's the way to go; I'll be doing them in my 50s, hopefully.
- I've never deprived myself of anything. I've always thought if you need to lose weight, carry on eating what you like, just eat less. I don't agree with doing without pasta or bread; it's too harsh.
- I've always embraced everything and been open-minded about what's ahead.
- I find it very easy to love because I grew up in such a loving family.
- Sunday night is curry night. I always order a spinach paneer and a chicken tikka. There's usually something good on TV like 'Mr Selfridge' or 'Downton Abbey,' so I'll watch them before I have to think about blowdrying my hair and all the other boring stuff us girls have to do!
- Life experiences can, at times, be quite humbling, but you learn from them. But I like the changes in my life and what kind of person they've made me into. I'm very open, not as judgmental as I was in my twenties, and a lot more compassionate.
- I like to experiment, and my life has been eventful.
- My daughter is the funniest person I know, and I couldn't imagine my life without her.
- I was always in trouble for chatting. My school reports all used to say, 'Donna is a very bright girl, but she must stop talking in class.' In the end, I made a career out of it.
- After a really hectic week, I hate going out on a Friday evening, so I'll always opt for a night at home.
- I've been a skinny girl my whole life. I just don't sit down - I'm always on the go. It must be down to the genes. We have a healthy body image in my house and great appetites. It'd be hard for you to find a food I don't love.
- I think a lot of mothers are doing as I am: starting up their own ventures as their children grow older, and having a kind of second blooming.
- My dad was a mechanical engineer and a drummer. We had no money, but I never felt we had no money, and that's what I remember now, having my own child. I think, 'Oh so what?' Kids don't go around the house seeing what's wrong with it.
- I've always earned my own money and enjoy being independent. It's how I was brought up.
- I love nothing more than taking my dog, Molly, for a long walk on Sunday morning. Then I'll indulge in some Bikram yoga or something fun like reflexology.
- When you work and earn money as a child, you need to be confident, but it can make you a bit precocious, and I think I was a bit of a pain for a while when I was young.
- I really feel it when I can't get to the gym for a few weeks. I like to run on a treadmill in the gym so I can keep track of what I'm doing.
