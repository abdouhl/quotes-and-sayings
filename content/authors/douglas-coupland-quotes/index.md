- Comedy is the difference between how you see a person and how they see themselves.
- Bespoke tailoring: yes! I found this one pair of pants - they're Canali - and brought them into a tailor and said, 'Clone these, dammit.' They just do all the right things.

And God's name will have ended up being 'Google,' because that's the way it worked out. It could have worked out that God's name ended up being 'Yahoo,' of course, but they lost out.
- Games I do find interesting for what they say about us, about what we wish for, about the programming. But let it stop there: don't listen to this rubbish about them actually being good for you, helping with hand-eye co-ordination or whatever. They're games. They prepare you for nothing.

- I had a lot of really terrible advice early in my writing career and I cheesed off people without even knowing it, all the while thinking I was implementing good advice.

- I decided at 40 I was wasting entire chunks of my brain and didn't want to blow my one chance on Earth. I'm glad I made that decision.

- Most of us have only two or three genuinely interesting moments in our lives; the rest is filler.
- I think that in the future, clocks won't say three o'clock anymore. They'll just get right to the point and rename three o'clock 'Pepsi.'

- In a faraway land called 'pre-2000,' what Earthlings now call blogging was called 'keeping a diary.' It's hard work to do well. I tried doing it in the early 1990s but had to stop because I no longer had a life - instead I had this thing that generated anecdotes to go into my diary. The diary took over and I had to stop.
- There's much to be said for feeling numb. Time passes more quickly. You eat less, and because numbness encourages laziness, you do fewer things, good or bad, and the world's probably a better place for it.
- Never loan a book to someone if you expect to get it back. Loaning books is the same as giving them away.

- Only losers make decisions when things are bad. The time to rejig your life is the time when it's seemingly smooth.

- I don't think I see the world in terms of stupid or clever, but in terms of being able to get irony. There's some awful statistic about only 20 per cent of Americans being able to understand irony.

- For many people, myself included, the end of the world is happening all the time! It is a form of criticality that paradoxically gives us hope for change and improvement.

- North America can easily fragment quickly as did the Eastern Bloc in 1989.
- Time perception is very much about how you sequence your activities, how many activities you layer overtop of others, and the types of gaps, if any, you leave in between activities.
- Everyone should have a tailor. David Wilkes, the guy who does my stuff, is like, 'Well you're a writer - do you want a special pen compartment or something?' Bespoke: That's the term you want to get out there.
- The Internet has destroyed irony in the world, or at least wounded it considerably. What are we to do about an invention whose end result is that starving people in China are looking up things on marthastewart.com?
- The neighborhood I grew up in had this fence that surrounds the watershed. And if you go on the other side of that fence, there's nothing until the North Pole and down to Siberia. It's the absolute cutoff point between man and nature.
- I want pills called September 10. You take one and your mind feels like the 11th never happened.
- Nature is one great big wood-chipper. Sooner or later, everything shoots out the other end in a spray of blood, bones and hair.
- With Google I'm starting to burn out on knowing the answer to everything. People in the year 2020 are going to be nostalgic for the sensation of feeling clueless.
- I don't want any vegetables, thank you. I paid for the cow to eat them for me.
- I miss the reference section at the library. I used to go there twice a week on missions. Now everywhere's a research library and I can't get an elitist kick from it any more.
- My life is neither a disaster nor supernatural, yet it is an unlikely event.
- Canadians can easily 'pass for American' as long as we don't accidentally use metric measurements or apologize when hit by a car.
- It's a cliche, but true, that writing is intensely solitary and at times really lonely. I sit in one room and talk to squirrels and blue jays all day.
- In the future, torture will once again become the recreational sport of the rich.
- Everybody past a certain age, regardless of how they look on the outside, pretty much constantly dreams of being able to escape from their lives.
- The thing about the future is that it never feels the way we thought it would.
- The thing with bookshelves, no matter how many you have, you always fill them.
- We want our idols to be dead because it makes death a much less scary place.
- The universe hands you opportunities for a while, and if you don't take them, the universe says to itself, 'Oh I see, this person doesn't like opportunities' and stops giving them to you.
- There's a lot to be said for having a small manageable dream.
- When the world throws you too much information, the only way you can stay sane or survive is to look for pattern recognition. Amidst all the blurs, is there a constellation that emerges, is there a straight line that's emerging?
- It's difficult to speak with beautiful people. No matter how hard you try to pretend otherwise, you still want them to like you.
- Christmas makes everything twice as sad.
- Cellphones have, if nothing else, turned TV crime writers into lazy sloths.
- I've never gone on Facebook or MySpace.
- Big companies are like marching bands. Even if half the band is playing random notes, it still sounds kind of like music. The concealment of failure is built into them.
- Workshops and seminars are basically financial speed dating for clueless people.
- If a building looks better under construction than it does when finished, then it's a failure.
- I grew up with three brothers, so nearly everything I had was destroyed or made fun of.

- Forget sex or politics or religion, loneliness is the subject that clears out a room.
- I'm always looking for things that are so incredibly present that they become invisible.
- I've never really seen too much difference between writing or making visual art or designing furniture or clothing. It's still my brain - I'm just using different parts of it for different things.
- If human beings had genuine courage, they'd wear their costumes every day of the year, not just on Halloween.
- TV didn't kill radio, it just added something new to the mix.
