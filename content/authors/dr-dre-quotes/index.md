- It's always weird when people approach me to make an investment. I tell them, 'I don't need any more money. I'm good.' Then I wait for their expression. That part is entertaining, because people look at you like you're crazy when you say you don't need any more money. Who says that?

- I realized at a young age that sequence in an album is almost as important as the songs that are on the album.
- I've been living the American Dream for over 25 years - just being able to do what I do, be creative, and make money out of it. It's incredible.
