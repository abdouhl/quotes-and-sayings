- Apparently my taste is that of a 13-year-old girl. Not really. But my taste is commercial.
- Becky G is a huge priority for me.
- I'm looking for voices that are distinctive. That's the most important thing to me. I mean, obviously they have to be able to sing.
- There's no compromise to me in what I'm doing. I'm trying to make songs that I love and make them feel a certain way and go to certain places. It just so happens that a lot of 13-year-old girls like that.
- With the beginning of any record for an artist there's a certain amount of time of finding the blueprint and trying to find what the architecture is of the sound.
- I really love Stuart Price, he's a great producer and beat maker.
- Basically I feel like my role is to find great songs with the artists, for the artists, and have them shine.
- I do believe that music will change and has to change in some capacity, and I'll either change and reinvent or sink or swim.
- I've read that I'm ruining music. It makes me kind of laugh.
- Howard Shore, who's an amazing film composer, told me once that it's 10 percent inspiration, 90 percent perspiration. So I think even within the creative process, like being a producer, you're really managing people and getting the best out of them.
- I feel like if you can make music, and get people to, you know, evoke that feeling out of other people through writing songs, that's a pretty cool thing to do.
- The hardest thing, and the most difficult thing, is to do the most simple thing. Because that means that you've had to weed out every other option. I kind of feel like that about a good pop song, too. When it's right, it's perfect, you know?
- I think there are records that will sell, and I think what makes a record sell is a continuity of sound.
- A hit record is a matter of a million things going right.
- A list songwriters and producers are reluctant to give Kesha their songs because of her weight.
- I can sign things that I love that may not be selling millions of singles but that are just awesome music.
- I grew up in New York.
- If I'm not happy with something and I don't feel like it's right, I won't put it out.
- I feel like Britney kind of has her own genre: If you look at songs like 'Toxic' and 'Piece of Me' and 'Oops! I Did It Again,' they all were sort of influential and led the way.
- For me, I'm more a fan of the songs than of the artists because often, it's not worth getting the whole album. There's usually a few singles and the rest of it is politics or something.
- I think there's a way to do classic songs and produce them electronically, and I feel like the eighties did a lot of that.
- I have 3 sisters, a daughter, and a son with my girlfriend, and a feminist mom who raised me right.
- Well, each artist has something special about them. And I try to find whats best in them and find a song that works with it.
- Sometimes you have to do things in people's best interests and they don't even know it, and maybe they'll figure it out later and thank you, and maybe they won't. Most likely they won't.
- There's no amount of money that would make me do something that I didn't want to do.
- You're always super stoked when you see that your song did go the distance and people are recognizing it.
- Listen, there's been times in my life like the two years that I only listened to jazz, and probably nothing after 1966. When I went to the Manhattan School of Music, the library didn't have anything after 1966. In order to get good at that, I had to tunnel-vision and focus on that.
- I never could make it to morning classes. I never felt like I needed to do it. I remember being in class, and saying, I don't care about this, I don't need to know this.'
- Kesha and I made a lot of songs together and it was often good but there were creative differences at times.
- I don't want to disappoint people. Especially with an icon like Britney. You don't want to be the one who messed it up.
- If you look at the charts, there's not a lot of male artists and for whatever reason, female artists sell a lot more records and get played a lot more on the radio.
- For me to just be a face on something, I'd look at myself and be disappointed. I'd rather be the person behind the scenes making the show.
- If you listen to Tears for Fears, they had great melodies and less rigid cut-and-paste.
- My music isn't Leonard Cohen. But people are going to smile when it comes on.
- My problem with eighties songs is they take too long to get to the chorus.
- First of all, I really appreciate what I've got and I know that we're all sort of on borrowed time. I think I'm also kind of neurotic and scared - I never feel, like, 'Oh, I got this on lock, no problem.' I think that combined with having such an amazing team that are bringing in fresh ideas is what's made it work.
- All of their horrific allegations of abuse, threats and purported misconduct by me against Kesha are completely untrue and deeply hurtful.
- The first record with an artist oftentimes can be the most exciting. When it's not routine for them, when it's really new is the best moment in their careers.
