- It's fun to move people musically.
- When someone gets passed that mic, and they know deep down inside that they wanna say something or sing something or produce something, but they don't do that, it's like killing your musical life.
- Any form of art is political if you make it that way.
- I like performing in front of big crowds.
- When you are culture, you're forever young, like Snoop. When you're on that level, it's just contributing to the gangsta.
