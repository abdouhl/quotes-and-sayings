- The first album I was given when I was quite young was the 'Whoa, Nelly!' album by Nelly Furtado. After, I also got the 'Missundaztood' album by Pink. That's when I was like, 'Oh my God, I want to be just like them!'
- I always wanted the flowiness that hip-hop artists had. I always admired how they rapped so fast, but I never wanted to rap; I wanted to sing the rap.
- 'Redbone' from Childish Gambino - that is my ideal summer tune. It's already gone and done its thing, but I want it to live on forever.
- I feel like I wear kind of the same things on stage that I would wear every day, unless I'm being lazy, and then I just wear trackies. But actually, if I'm honest, I wouldn't really walk down Kilburn High Street in a leotard, and I would wear that onstage.
- My parents never pushed me towards music. I feel like, growing up in a musical household and always being surrounded by it, I was always kind of a performer child. I remember my parents would have guests over, and they would bring their kids, and I would make sure that we were ready to put a show on.
- My goal is to get my music out to as many people as possible. That a song of mine is being played on the radio so far away from home really, really pushes me. It's everything I've dreamed of.
- For a female artist, it takes a lot more to be taken seriously if you're not sat down at a piano or with a guitar, you know?
- I've always been very much in control of my music and my image, and I think one of the things I've been lucky about is I didn't bring a label on board until I really figured out who I was.
- I get a bit insecure if I feel like there's too much makeup on my face or if I feel like I'm cakey.
- I can't dance. If I try, I'll trip onstage.
- I still take a lot of pride in being able to write my own songs. My story's coming from me.
- I like how powerful fashion makes me feel. I live for that grungy-prissy juxtaposition that Kate Moss, Naomi Campbell, and Drew Barrymore wore in the '90s.
- I love Pink and Nelly Furtado - the honesty and truth in their lyrics. I also love Kendrick Lamar and Chance the Rapper.
- If I wasn't a singer, I would be a fairy princess.
- Success, to me, is just doing things that I'm really proud of.
- I always told myself never to have a plan B - I feel like that's also one of the reasons I'm doing what I'm doing now, because I just never really rested until I got here.
- Social media can sometimes influence the charts, but I think that only great music makes it to the top. The good songs make it.
- When I think of artists I love, like J. Cole, it's the storytelling that grabs me. I want to be honest with my music.
- I'm learning to accept myself. I'm still in the process of learning to love who I am. And it's been really refreshing and really nice to be able to do that and be okay. I think my fans have brought that out in me.
- Everything that I do is very autobiographical. I'm trying to be as much of an open book as possible and give the audience every single piece of me.
- Traveling is the worst for skin, and it shows instantly. Once you're working non-stop, you can instantly see it.
- For me, my aim is to just be as good as possible. If people do look up to me, I have to set the best example I can.
- I'm heavily influenced by the Nineties - I love juxtaposing a slip dress with trainers and a vintage leather jacket.
- For a male artist, people instantly assume they write their own music, but for women, they assume it's all manufactured.
- I use a toothbrush on my lips as a lip scrub; occasionally, I use a toothbrush with some dark eye shadow on my eye brows if I want to fill them in. And if I want a really thick, textured look with mascara, I put one on my lashes, as well.
- I'd love to work with Drake; I'd love to work with Frank Ocean, Jay Z, and Kanye. The list is endless.
- I started posting covers online and having this crazy determination about what I wanted to do and just went for it. I was like, 'Okay, no one else can create my future for me, and no one can get what I want for me, so I have to go out and get it myself.'
- I'm so obsessed with Cardi B. I do nothing but sit and watch her Instagram videos.
- I think the artists are really the face of the music they make. It's no longer the genre that dictates it.
- I never really wanted to base success on charts and chart positioning. For me, it's really about the shows and seeing them grow.
- I dated this guy who literally would never eat a single vegetable. I was like, 'This is terrible. You eat like a five-year-old.'
- Every time you achieve something, you want to go after what's next. I'd like to see my own shows grow and someday be a headliner, fill up stadiums.
- I was 11 and living in Kosovo. I knew I wanted to perform but didn't feel like I could do it there. So I moved back to London on my own at 15, carried on going to school, and started posting cover songs online. I had no idea how I was going to become a performer, but I felt like I had so many more opportunities being in London.
- My first concert was Method Man and Redman because they came down to Kosovo.
- It's challenging to open for someone: You've got to prep the audience, get them in the mood, and get their attention if they don't know you. You're going to show them what songs you've got. You've got to leave your mark.
- I spend a lot of time in bed when I'm off. But if I'm feeling adventurous, I'll go to a gallery.
- My father was a musician, so I feel like falling into this career was a bit inevitable.
