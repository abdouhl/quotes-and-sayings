- Being from a big band is great because you can do other bands.
- When the record company pays you an advance, it is just that - an advance. And it's at worse rates than any bank would charge you to pay them back.
- I just don't like reality TV.
- I have panic attacks here and there, like in the weirdest places ever, and I've learned to deal with them.
- It's a modern world we live in, with everything at our fingertips, and if it's not at our fingertips, you can dot-com anything.
- I came up in the punk rock scene of Seattle.
- Rock n' roll is a volatile thing; at least, it's supposed to be.
- I got to the point of insanity, but I also got out, but during the insane times, I felt invincible, and I felt creative and wonderful, too, but I was also hiding something.
- One of my first memories is marching with my mom. I was in kindergarten with with the Catholic ladies when Martin Luther King Jr. got shot. We wore the black armbands and marched downtown.
- We wrote the songs we wrote - we took from our own experiences, melded it together, and wrote what became 'Appetite For Destruction.'
- When you're in a band, a marriage - whatever, it's kind of the same deal - there's a lot of things that you see, and people trust you with information about their lives. Call it a 'bro code' or whatever you wanna call it, but there are certain things you do not tell. At least, I don't.
- I read Slash's book because we were on the road together with Velvet Revolver when that came out.
- If you don't have a good rhythm section, your band is toast; you're a bar band. Good rhythm section, you've got a chance to get out of the bar.
- I made money in my 20s, became sober in my 30s, looked around, and didn't know who I could trust for money advice.
- I went to business school in my thirties.
- When you know you have a good song, when you're onstage, even if it's just a weird, basic energy, you know your song is good.
- Axl's favorite record in 1987 was 'Faith,' by George Michael.
- When I sing with Loaded, I can't move at all. I'm playing guitar, and I'm singing.
- When I started going to business school, I started getting calls from my peers asking for my help. I thought, 'Well, there are a lot of people like me who make a bunch of money and just get so scared of it and don't know what to do with it.' I just didn't want to be 60 years old and broke.
- You become friends with your kids' friends' parents. That's just the way it's gonna be. And sometimes you luck out, and it's great.
- I have a teenage daughter and a 10-year-old daughter. Things are pink and fluffy at my house, with two little dogs. It's pretty funny to be me now. And I'm in on the joke that is my life.
- When you start a band, you have to find people that are good, have the same sort of mindset as you musically.
- People in Seattle - and I'm speaking from experience - are indoors more. It used to just rain a ton, and as a result, you'd be inside listening to music all the time and playing. You'd all rehearse at each other's houses and share ideas. There was no competition. When I got to L.A., I was really stunned by the competition.
- Words and titles can be used as dictums and guides for all of us. A certain word can suddenly snap us back to a good place. 'Rocker' works for me.
- When you're in a band, it's a close-knit thing. There's a lot of emotional stuff.
- I've never seen 'The Simpsons.'
- I didn't have any work to do, and I had files of my personal and Guns N' Roses financial statements for the previous eight years. I wanted to learn how to read these, but I didn't trust anybody. I just got a lightbulb in my head and said, 'I want to go to school.' That began my journey, taking accountancy and business classes at Seattle.
- I kind of feel bad that I don't know the names of the people in Girls Aloud!
- I had a column for the 'Seattle Weekly' for five years, and there was one column that was called 'How To Be A Man,' and it was kind of tongue in cheek; it was really tongue in cheek. And I got a book deal from that column.
- By the time Guns n' Roses spent 28 months from 1991 to 1993 touring the 'Use Your Illusion' albums, the tour staff sometimes approached 100 people. We were carrying not only backup girl singers, a horn section, and an extra keyboard player, but also chiropractors, masseuses, a singing coach, and a tattoo artist.
- Keep a meter on your fear. Fear can cripple you.
- 'The Joshua Tree' was the soundtrack of my life when we were making 'Appetite.'
- Being in a band is the best place I can think of to be as up-front as possible. If you let something stew, it'll grow into a mountain of nonsensical black mud in no time.
- I went to Seattle U. Nice Jesuit school there.
- I didn't start off as a bass player, and Guns was the first band I really, like, 'Oh, I'm gonna be a bass player. This is what I'm gonna do.' And I really dove into it head first.
- My twenties were tumultuous at best... I think.
- It's funny: when I started playing bass in 1984, you had guys like Paul Simonon fron the Clash, John Paul Jones, Lemmy, and Nikki Sixx was the head guy in Motley Crue, and you had all this post-punk stuff like Magazine and Killing Joke where the bass sort of lead the way. Not that I picked it to sort of be a main dude, but it intrigued me.
- Back when I was single and Guns were on the 'Illusions' tour, chicks were, like, left and right. They were falling over themselves. And I saw the sadness in that. The first six months of that, it's like, 'Killer! Chicks are hot. They're into me.' And then you realize they're not really into you. They're into the guy they saw on the JumboTron.
- Not to name names, but a lot of pop female artists you see, they don't write their own songs. Lot of top male artists and boy band artists, they don't write their own songs. They're just a product. They sell, they sell, they sell. They don't care about musical integrity, any of that kind of stuff.
- I saw some really amazing stuff with Axl. We worked really well together. We were good friends. And I hope to perhaps have that friendship back one day, although it's not something I wait around for.
- Whenever Boston comes on, I play air guitar.
- It's volatile with GNR. Every night, it's anarchy on stage. Who knows what's gonna happen? That's rock n' roll, man.
- One of the first 45s I ever bought was the Stooges' 'I Got a Right.' Probably one of my favorite singles, ever.
- Turn off the TV, turn off the Internet, just go out, and I bet you your life will get better really quick.
- I'm a book nerd, and I've seen authors that I love, I've gone and seen them speak or read from a book.
- Our family is mixed. My oldest sister married a black man in 1962, which was way out there then.
- Is the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame that important to me? No. Is it something I've aspired towards? No.
- I can only write from a man's viewpoint.
- 'Chip Away' is somewhat of a rail against cable news and divisive agendas... all for the almighty dollar.
- I think you can tell stories and give perspectives and yet still keep stuff for yourself, too. I keep a lot of my life private, even in a public forum like writing.
- I don't know where I'm rated. I don't pay attention to that. I'm really so just all into my craft. It's not a contest. I try to play the best.
- I don't have resentments towards anyone I played with or to the guy who bullied me in the sixth grade. I've worked through it.
- I've never been one to just play safe music and think that's all there is to it.
- Everybody in Seattle thought I was the chosen one, musically wise. You know, if anyone was going to make it, it was going to be that guy.
- I've had a panic disorder since I was sixteen, and they always said that's a subset of depression. And I'm like, 'I don't have depression.'
- Lemmy Kilmeister is most certainly a rocker.
- Left to my own devices, I tend to go darker and weirder, and it's fun.
- Read books and keep informed. The conversation can get old if you don't have some good new topics to bring to the table.
- Writing's another expression of art, really, that I'm just kind of discovering as I go.
- Never in my life have I thought, 'Man, I gotta get a Grammy.'
- I saw the Clash in '79 at the Paramount in Seattle, and it changed my whole life.
- I do love the term 'rocker.' The word itself imbues a ton of imagery and romance. But I don't think a rocker needs to have AC/DC and Metallica and the Black Keys rumbling through their car speakers speeding headlong into the night.
- There is definitely an art to the dance that is being in a band.
- Three weeks into being in Hollywood, I was playing with Slash through an ad in the paper.
- Any musician in any band - for a really good band - you know your part in the band.
- I have mutual funds. I have a lot of individual stocks. I'm across the board, really well diversified.
- I'm not Cormac McCarthy, but I can get my point across in a thousand words.
- I've been very fortunate. But rich? People make huge assumptions about the guys in Gn'R.
- I have a wife and two kids.
- I never had a personal beef with Axl, truth be told.
- My grandfather John came from Cork. I have six degrees of separation in Ireland.
- 'Mr. Brownstone' is always a fun song to play because it's got that beat, and you see people bouncing.
- I don't shop.
- The thing is that business and success, and how hard it is, doesn't look any different whether you're playing a gig at eleven o'clock at night or you're going to work at nine in the morning at a law firm.
- That connectivity with the audience that I get to enjoy, that's my church. It's not one of ego or anything like, 'I'm on the stage and the lights.' It's just this connectivity, and it's always been that way for me.
- Attending Seattle Central was an awesome experience - it taught me a lot about discipline in a great way.
- You never know what's around the corner.
- Being a rocker, to me, is equal to living as much of the truth as possible.
- I find in my career that I never know what's going to happen in two months.
- Personally, I had made a good amount of dough for a 30-year-old guy, but I didn't know a thing about money. I'm not a dumb guy, but I couldn't figure them out.
- I'm really not about changing my image.
- 'The Taking' is the closest thing to a 'concept' record that I have ever been involved with. Pain, loss, triumph, and redemption. Life. Bring it.
- Axl did sometimes have volatile actions, but I knew that guy as a whole - all the good stuff, too.
- I started playing in punk-rock bands and touring when I was 15, so I missed high school.
- Sometimes, when you get into a record, it's like writing a book, and you get so far inside the story you can't tell anymore if it's gonna be good to an outside listener.
- I learned, by the time I was twenty, I'm not gonna die from a panic attack; you feel like you're going to.
- In rock n' roll, we don't sell records at all like we used to. Yet the artist still has to pay to make records. So you've just got to get out on tour and be smarter about your merchandising.

- I'm colour blind, a little hue-challenged.
- I don't know if I have a favorite song.
- Guns N' Roses is a weighty subject, but in the same breath, I don't take it that seriously.
- You can't mass produce somebody's heart and soul. It's a very delicate thing.
- When you're a musician, you are around your peers a lot, like Slipknot and Alice In Chains... you name the band. We're all just kind of friends.
- Music was going to be my thing. Was I going to make a living at it? That was kind of a joke. It was just my passion, and if I was broke doing my passion, so be it.
- I have always been a huge sports fan, but more of the pedestrian and 'homer' sort.
- You know what's a great song that will be stuck in your head if I say it? 'Single Ladies,' by Beyonce. Killer song.
- Playing with Iggy pulled me back in for a while and reminded me of what I love about music.
- I think after 9/11, here in America, I saw something extraordinary. I saw neighbors looking after neighbors. I don't think anybody asked who anybody voted for. It was people taking care of other people.
