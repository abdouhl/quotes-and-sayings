- I'm interested in roles that are human, that have some sort of empathic quality.
- If Cole and I are together, we're noticeable. Fan encounters come with the job, and you can't shy away from them.
- After 'Big Daddy,' it was really slow. We weren't booking a lot, and we did a little bit here and there, but, you know, we basically went back to school, did what normal kids do.
- I'm actually shy in person.
- I'm a people person. That's my bread and butter.
- I want to skydive.
- If you want your kid in the business, ask them if that's what they want. Don't be weird about it. There's a lot of pressure out there. Your child may fail. A lot of it has to do with chance, and it may not work out the way you or your child expects. You have to understand that ahead of time.
- I started doing home brew stuff with my dad when I was younger.
- Auditioning sucks!
- I love acting as a passion. It's something that is really fulfilling to me. But the core of it, which is one of its most difficult aspects, is that it's commission-based.
- Historically, Disney Channel stars don't survive well outside of the Disney environment.
- My brother and I always intended to get back into acting. We just wanted to take a break because, I think, coming off of the seven-year run of 'The Suite Life,' we wanted to detach ourselves from that idea a little bit.
- The thing is, it was never a decision for me to never return to acting.
- If you want to be an actor or actress out of high school or college, just know what you're getting in for. It's a job. If you look at it like a job, and you make it a career and a profession, then you're bound to do well.
- A role I would not do: cool jock. That's not something I'd be interested in doing.
- I can kind of make money through my other passion, which is brewing, and that's a pretty stable business, and it would free up my timeslot to take roles that I really liked and that I thought were interesting.
- I'm just immensely proud of my brother for tackling both the big job of doing 'Riverdale,' which is a lot of hours and has had, like, a lot of success, and also at the same time not losing sight of his passions like photography, which he's very good at.
- We went to public schools from kindergarten through seventh grade, and it was fun.
- I play Zack Martin on 'The Suite Life of Zack and Cody.'
- I used to be very scared of silence because I felt it was my responsibility to keep people occupied. That definitely spawns from an insecurity in myself. When people aren't enjoying themselves, when I'm involved, it somehow comes back to it being my fault. But I do want people to have a good time.
- I studied video game design. The one thing I knew for sure about myself is I didn't want to study acting.
- When you are born into a body that takes the image of another, you ask yourself a question much like the famous 'chicken and egg' conundrum. Do you take the form of he, or does he take the form of you?
- It's easy to stereotype twins into any role. There's not a lot of great twin roles written, and oftentimes, when there are, they're given to a single actor who green screens themselves into both places.
- Escargot is pretty good.
- I tend to enjoy roles that I very closely identify with: fringe people and complicated characters, who might even be bad guys, or bad characters that have one redeeming quality.
- Everyone has friends or people they know, while they aren't definitively sociopaths, they have sociopathic qualities.
- Scripts that make characters a two-sentence description, I'm not interested in.
- I'm not a super carbonated guy: some people like drinking their beer like it's a champagne, right? It's not my vibe.
