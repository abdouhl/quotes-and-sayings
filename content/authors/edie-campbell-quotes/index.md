- I find it quite boring when people do things that are very considered and thought through. I like things best when they're just done because they're fun or beautiful, or simply because they are what that one person wanted to do at that one time.
- To be the outsider is actually a great thing in England.
- If you always feel like an imposter, you work harder, and that makes you better at your job. You've got to keep a level of variation; otherwise, you'll end up talking about nails and beauty products all the time.
- I just think that the Victoria's Secret girl values herself by the way she looks. And that might be linked with being healthy, but that's all it is, and it sets a negative example to other people.
- Sometimes I wake up and think, 'I want to look like Sherlock Holmes today,' and other times I want to look like a witch from 'Macbeth.'
- I think Stella Tennant is amazing. And then I really loved all those '60s society models, like Edie Sedgwick.
- I am truly honoured to become ambassadress for Yves Saint Laurent. The brand's modern vision of beauty is very inspiring, and I am particularly proud to represent such an audacious archetype of woman.
- I think TV shows have usurped films!
- It's amazing to be able to work with people right at the top of whatever they do... inspiring photographers and stylists with very interesting visual language. The more I do it, the more I enjoy it.
- There's a thing in the U.K., particularly in London, where it's kind of the idea of subculture and counterculture and the outside and the idea that it's great to be a freak, and the freak always wins. So I think English girls are a lot less scared of being the freak or looking like an idiot.
- There's really nothing better than a hunt ball.
- Everything comes back to the horse, which is why I love it. You put your ego aside, and you concentrate on getting the best performance out of this creature.
- I have a terrible habit of shopping after I go to the gym or hitting eBay.
- It's very good for you, riding. You know how every model is like, 'I do yoga.' Well, I find horses to have the same effect, in that you have to put your ego aside and concentrate on making the horse do the things you want it to do, and move in the way you want it to move - particularly if you're doing dressage.
- You'll never see me with a precision flick of eyeliner. Messy eyeliner became my thing by accident rather than design. If you can't get it straight, then just work it in around your eyes.
- You can't really plan for how that training session or competition is going to go. You have to see what your horse is giving you to work with, and then you tailor all your training around that.
- I wear clothes and sell products and ideas.
- People need to take a breath and remember that it's only fashion. Relax. No one's going to die.
- I think there is something to be said for not feeling like just because you're a model you have to be dressed up, look amazing, go to every party, and be smiling all the time.
- I've been making a diary of the daft things people have said during London Fashion Week, and it does wear a little bit thin, everyone comparing my name to Edie Sedgwick.
- I'm not very good at going to parties and looking like I'm having fun.
- I always find Victoria's Secret models a bit weird.
- I needed to pay for my horses in Warwickshire, and I couldn't do that off a waitress' wage.
- The more I mistreat my hair, the stronger it grows back. I think it must be determined to survive.
- What I like about Yves Saint Laurent Black Opium is that it's an understated scent that's somehow familiar.
- I like wearing things that are a bit off but not in a ridiculous 'I'm wearing a huge hat' kind of way. More a socks with sandals way.
- Everyone Instagrams all the people they are with. I get that it's part of the job. But there's a point where it's like, 'Can't you just be a person and have a separate life to your job?'
- My role is to embody the Black Opium woman - I suppose you have to be the living embodiment of all the intangible things the brand stands for.
- I'd like to work with horses, but it doesn't pay very well. Maybe I'd like to go somewhere in the Middle East because they keep buying really nice horses for their Olympic teams - like, the Qataris.
- I don't worry about chemicals. There are enough chemicals entering my body through all the fizzy drinks I consume to worry if my lip balm is 100 per cent organic.
- Kristen Stewart always looks good - she wears what she wants. It's the same with Alison Mosshart - she chooses clothes that she loves rather than what she thinks she should wear.
- If I wasn't modelling, I'd probably be an intern somewhere, working for someone who interned the year before me.
- When I was 17, I used to really think about what I wore every day.
- Maybe the Burberry woman is undefinable! I think it's less about what she looks like and more about an attitude.
- My favourite smell is horses. In fact, most of the time, I do smell like horses.
- How hard can it be to walk up and down in a straight line? You just need to put one step in front of another; most people do it all the time. What's the worst that can happen? You fall over. Sometimes that happens to non-models, too; it wouldn't be the end of the world.
- I have a really great show jacket from Lavalliere that's really well made, and I have a great pair of Gucci jodhpurs, which is hilarious.
