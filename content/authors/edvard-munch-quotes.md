- Death is pitch-dark, but colors are light. To be a painter, one must work with rays of light.
- By painting colors and lines and forms seen in quickened mood I was seeking to make this mood vibrate as a phonograph does. This was the origin of the paintings in The Frieze of Life.

- It was always my intention that The Frieze should be housed in a room which would provide a suitable architectural frame for it.
