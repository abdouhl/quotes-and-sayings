- I don't like pain.
- I make a genuine distinction between loneliness and aloneness. I know what each is like. There are times I'm lonely. But there are also many times when I need to be alone, when I don't want the feeling of someone else in the house other than the cats.
- People think I write weird, but there are people at Death Equinox that make me look like Danielle Steele.
- There's no way my body can be fixed, but what we can hope to do is keep all the deteriorative processes as minimal as possible.
