- Actors are always grabbing each other on stage, looking in each other's eyes, making a moment so private, the audience doesn't know what they're doing.
- I'm an actor. I'll take a lead if it's offered. The really good actors can fill a character, no matter what the role is. A good leading man is a character actor; a good character actor can be a leading man.
- I remember seeing the first Astaire-Rogers musical on television, and I couldn't believe how beautiful it was. It dawned on me that you don't have to wear a cowboy hat to be a man.
- You ingest the automobile in the very air of Detroit. Or at least you did in the 1940s and 1950s.
- How many times can you play an action character, or a quirky romantic? Every actor has to find his own way to make each character unique.
- Growing up as a kid in Detroit, way back, there was a movie station that would show old kinescope reproductions of old movies, and I remember seeing Bela Lugosi for the first time and being duly frightened out of my wits.
- I thought cars were essential ingredients of life itself.
- The French suffered such catastrophic losses in the First World War. It really was the end of them as a great world power, although they, quote, 'won.'
- I think it's much richer and much more fun to be an artist than to be anything else. I can't think of a better life than acting.
- Automobiles have always been part of my life, and I'm sure they always will be. What is it about them that moves me? The sound of a great engine, the unity and uniqueness of an automobile's engineering and coachwork, the history of the company and the car, and, of course, the sheer beauty of the thing.
- I like sunny stories. You know, my favorite girls in the '50s were Debbie Reynolds, Doris Day, and Esther Williams.
