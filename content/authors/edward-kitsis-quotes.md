- The thing with 'Peter Pan' is it's been done so well so many times.
- The humor and emotion of the 'Do You Want to Build a Snowman' theme makes me cry every time I watch it, and that deep emotion is something we'd love to do on the show. If we can make you cry, we always try to. And 'Once,' when it's at its best, is emotional and fun.
- The two favorite episodes of 'Lost' that Adam and I wrote were 'Dave,' which was where Hurley has an imaginary friend, and 'Trisha Tanaka is Dead,' where Hurley finds a van and starts it.
- 'Peter Pan' is my favorite. I love the idea that all the Lost Boys were orphans, and that they wanted Wendy to be their mom.
- To do this job, you really have to love what you're doing.
- My guilty pleasure, to be frank with you, is 'The Monkees.'
- 'Northern Exposure.' I loved that show; I loved the way it was able to have episodes where somebody finds a woolly mammoth, he calls the museum in New York, they send a guy out, and the mammoth's gone because someone ate it. To me, that was everything I ever wanted to do. That show mixed emotion, humor and the surreal all at once.
- The 'Lost' pilot was wide enough and included enough things so that when Season Five came, and we spent half of the year in 1973, nobody cried foul. It felt like it was already a part of the DNA.
- My guilty pleasures tend to be weird, old shows that I find on channel 20 that I've never seen before like 'Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea' or the 'Planet of the Apes' TV show.
- In all life, there are the people that are right for you, and there are the people that are wrong for you, and then there are the people that you just choose.
- Every day, we have to strive to be better people. Some days we give in to weakness, and sometimes we give in to strength.
- 'Frozen' is a phenomenon on an entirely new Disney scale.
- Belief is so important in everything. You need to believe in magic. You need to believe in yourself. You need to believe in your family.
