- I've never been fired from an acting job.
- I love the Avengers movies and Iron Man and Captain America.
- I think the great thing about working for Marvel is no matter who is in the driver's seat, they seem to be making good stuff.
- I'm great at fake typing but in real life terrible.
- You never want me in a position to have to think. That's bad.
- I've been acting a long time. I've been a member of SAG since 1982.
- Honestly, I know it sounds corny, but as an actor, I'm just so happy to have a job.
- I'm a huge Donnie Wahlberg fan.
- If you meet someone on the street that likes something that you did or likes the way you brought this character to life, that's really rewarding. That's really cool.
- That's one of the cool things about being on a Marvel show: there's the possibility for all of these characters to collide.
- I know of the Daredevil comic because it's so iconic.
- Usually, I play people who are a lot younger than I am, because people think that I look really young, which I do.
- On certain movies, you make friends that end up being your friends for the rest of your life. Those are the ones that are the most special.
- I was kind of burned out, a little jaded, and just sort of disillusioned by all the 'Mighty Duck' movies and everything just being about making money and not really caring about scripts anymore.
- No one sets out to make a bad movie or disappoint anybody.
- I'm a movie nerd, and when I'm really looking forward to something coming out, the less I know, the better.
- When I was a kid, I was in all 'The Mighty Ducks' movies, and that sort of created this weird thing when I was very young. And luckily, I had a lot of really good friends and family that kept me from, I guess, going down a more negative path that actors can go down.
- I just love 'Guardians of the Galaxy,' man.
- I've always wanted to meet Robert Downey, Jr. because I think he's awesome.
- I think it would be fun to play a young Ozzy Osbourne in a movie about the formation of Black Sabbath.
- I just try to do justice to the scripts that are written.
- I tend to try and really separate my work from my real life.
- I just remember Freddie Prinze, Jr. being the nicest guy in the world. To the point where at first I thought, 'Hmm - there's no way anyone could be this nice.' But he really is one of the coolest dudes I've ever met.
- This business is filled with really talented actors, and I'm sure there's a lot of guys out there who could have also brought something really special to the roles I have played. I just feel lucky that I get a chance to do them.
- I loved movies, growing up. They brought me so much joy.
- What's funny is I still, more than anything, get recognized for 'The Mighty Ducks.' I love it. When I was younger, I would get embarrassed. I played sports growing up, and I'd be playing baseball, and the other team would be quacking at me and stuff.
- I had the good fortune to be in some movies when I was younger that, for whatever reason, people identified with or related with.
- As an actor, I'm always just so pumped when I get any job. To be a working actor takes a lot of luck.
- 'Hunger Games' was an awesome job. I never had to learn any lines. I never had to do any ADR.
- When I go home, I got a kid; I don't really spend a lot of time thinking about the character or anything that may or may not happen.
- Just so everyone knows out there - it's not easy to make a movie. It's really hard.
- 'Daredevil' is incredible, but I mean, 'The Mighty Ducks' put me in a conversation that I wasn't in before. I feel like I owe a lot of my career to being in those movies.
