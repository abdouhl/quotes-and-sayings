- I make bad choices. I've got such dodgy tastes in men.
- I didn't want to get married. What I knew of most men was something I didn't want any part of. I just wanted to work on my career.
- I like fashion. I like being in shape. I like to look nice and I like to make money, but I don't think that's the most, No. 1, important thing.
- I wanted to be an actress. I think it had a lot to do with being a kid and watching how every time my dad would stand up to talk people would applaud... that was pretty cool.
- There was a point when I almost gave up. I couldn't feed myself. I couldn't feed my pets.
- Don't forget to vote for Bill Clinton and Al Gore. Stay home if you're voting for Dole.
- I have to prove myself five times over.
- I started out pursuing an acting career out of college when I lived in Los Angeles. When I got an entry into broadcasting, I preferred it. I liked being me, rather than dressing up to be someone else. Now I'm 30 and doing a career of my own and have been in this career for eight years.
- My parents are always supportive of anything their kids do. They point out the pros and cons, but they let you make your own decisions, and when it's bad they stick by you.
- How rude would I be, walking around and saying: 'Hello. I'm Eleanor Mondale. My father was vice president of the United States. Treat me differently.'
- I like being involved in the lighter side of journalism because it serves a purpose, and it's fun. And I can keep my opinions off camera if I want.
- Actually, I'm 130, but 125 is what I put on my resume, because that's what I look like I weigh.
- I didn't like not having work and not having people return my calls.
- When you're nearing 35, going, 'Hey Dad, I can't make these payments,' just isn't cool.
- The reporting I did was mostly entertainment or lifestyle. I took a very different approach than most reporters. I approached it more casually than you would think a reporter would. Now I'm a morning radio personality, and radio is really casual.
- The biggest hurdle is figuring out who your friends are. Your real friends.
- I have more self-confidence than I did when I was in my 20s.
- I'd like to be the ambassador to the Bahamas.
- I've always considered myself a physical person. I don't call myself a farm girl, but I did spend a lot of years shoveling manure and throwing hay, because I worked to pay most of my riding expenses.
- I like to get wild.
- We're Norwegians. You know, the Vikings. My deadlift was 310 pounds. I mean, I was very, very strong - and I didn't take steroids. I did it all on my own.
