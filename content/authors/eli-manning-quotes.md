Just kind of argued a little louder or if there was a curfew, I always came in a little later than I was supposed to. If it was set for 12, I would come in at 12:45. I would test the limits a little. There was no real reason and I grew out of it, eventually.

- I like making fun of myself; I don't want to make fun of other people, so I don't mind doing something out of character that some people might not expect me to do.
- I'm worried about doing my best, playing to my potential, helping out my teammates, and trying to win games for the Giants.
- I'm going to go out and be the best quarterback I can be and get the most out of my potential.
- The quarterback, you can play with a lot of big injuries. You get a little injury like an index finger or a thumb that most people can play with, sometimes you can't. I've stayed away from some of those.
