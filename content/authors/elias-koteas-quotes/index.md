- I feel blessed. To live an artistic life, it's a blessing.
- Sometimes there are certain things that you gotta grow into. Sometimes, for some actors, they know it spiritually at a young age. Others need to grow into it.
- I don't know if it's a blessing or a curse, but every time I show up on set it still feels like the first time.
- A lot of these roles that I feel like I've had some sort of impact, or that have had an effect on me, have always been with directors who have the time to somehow get to know me. Any good director's going to be curious about who it is that's coming aboard.
- I can't stand to watch anything that I'm in. I tear it apart. The worst thing you can do is leave me alone and let me watch what I'm in. It's abusive.
- I play guys who are willing to go really far. If the dung really hits the fan, I don't know if I could walk the talk. But anyone who isn't willing to die for his convictions isn't worth living. My characters, no matter how demented they are, they have their convictions.
- I know that I'm a quirky guy, to say the least. I don't know how easy I am to cast for a network. It hasn't been because I haven't tried. But am I dying to be on a TV show? No.
