- Whether I'm pursuing a story or conducting an interview or I'm at the bakery implementing policy and procedure, I have a team who is looking to me. I think my persona is the same for both jobs - perhaps a little bit more in command with the bakery. I say that only because we have so many more employees, and ultimately I make every single decision.
- It's important to give back because that's what we were put on this planet to do.
- We don't have a no-dessert rule, but we do have a no-bad-ingredient rule. Everything from scratch.
- If you have an opportunity to help others or incite change, it feels like a moral obligation to do so.
- I personally didn't subscribe to drastically changing our lives as a result of having children. Our children are our world, but I truly believe that it's healthier to invite children into your life instead of making everything about them.
- We love food in our house.
- At the Human Rights Foundation, I love being able to drive an interview and value-connecting with someone I'm interviewing so that they feel comfortable enough to open up and share their story with me.
- When I've been working especially long hours, I make a point to spend an extra hour or two without my phone, doing something my children choose. They love the park or pool time, but mostly, they love my undivided attention.
- My dad is amazing: he taught me everything I know about sales. He volunteered to be the Girl Scout cookie mom and gave everybody sales quotas, and basically, every girl went home crying because he was super intense.
- I firmly believe that in order to take the best care of our children, we need to be sure that we take care of ourselves. I make it a priority to plan date night once a week, make time for a massage or, at the very least, a bubble bath when I can.
- Shifting gears from my journalistic work to bakery life allows me to step away and see things from a different perspective. Some of my most creative ideas or biggest aha moments have come when I was immersed in one job while thinking about the other from a slightly removed point of view.
- If not managed properly, owning a company and running a business with multiple locations can make you feel constantly overwhelmed.
- A lot of bakeries, especially cupcake stores, look like you just walked into a Katy Perry video.
- I absolutely value autonomy. I value freedom and having the ability to implement change right away.
- I've always loved baking - it's a huge part of who I am and what I do.
