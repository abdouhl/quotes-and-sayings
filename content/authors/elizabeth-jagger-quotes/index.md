- People tell me that I should eat more, but they don't know me: I eat a lot. It's pretty unpleasant that people assume every model is anorexic and bulimic.
- I do believe that if models look like children, then they shouldn't be sexualised.
- My parents have influenced my fashion choices. I inherited many of their older garments, and I like their style. I love my mother's elegant and dramatic couture dresses and the feeling for colour my father has.
- 'Finnegans Wake,' 'Alice and Wonderland' and 'Through the Looking Glass' live on my bedside table back home in London.
- I don't tweet. I prefer face-to-face communication and sometimes Instagram.
- On bad days, I like to wear something colourful so I strike attention. That's how I appear confident to others - and how I get confident.
- I thought that the fashion world could be a bit fake sometimes, but it's nothing compared to Hollywood. These girls would walk over their grandmothers' graves to get a part, and the producers talk about actresses like they're dirt, picking over every part of them so that they end up paranoid and having surgery.
- People assume that because I was brought up on Rolling Stones tours, and my father is who he is, I'm some kind of rock-and-roll bad girl.
- Never dress older than you are! The five wardrobe items you must have are a nice pair of well-fitting shoes, pajamas, sexy yet comfortable lingerie, a party dress in a bold colour and a jumpsuit.
