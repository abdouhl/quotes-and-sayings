- Be happy with who you are, and know that being you is the best thing you can do for yourself.
- What does it mean to be a superhero? We're all fighting for the better good. But, at the same time, I think what stands out is, as superheroes, you don't give up; you don't surrender. I think that's what makes a superhero.
- I wasn't able to relate to anyone on TV growing up, so I wanted to bring my own experiences to the screen.
- A short film is just another storytelling medium like TV, Features, and Webisodes. I am just thrilled that 'Silent Cargo' is getting out there for people to see.
- 'Carrie Diaries' was one of the scripts that was sent my way, and it was instantly something I wanted to work on. It was very charming, and there's a lot of heart to it. It was touching and nostalgic and relatable, and it validates so many coming-of-age issues in an open and honest way. I think it speaks to real life.
- YI think what's cool about 'Scott Pilgrim' is that it shows that there is a superhero within all of us. There's not one ideal image of what a superhero looks like, and you don't really see that until the end of the film.
- Toronto is home; nothing beats home.
- I just want to keep being creative, and I want to feel inspired by a role, and I want to keep acting.
