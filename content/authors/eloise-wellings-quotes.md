- I could pretty much live anywhere in the world as long as I'm with my family.

- I started Little Athletics when I was five years old, but my Olympics dream started when I was 10 years old.
- I feel like God's given me a gift in running and the opportunity to use running as a platform to help highlight the work of the Love Mercy Foundation in northern Uganda.
- I've been reading 'The Sisterhood,' and I love the author Bobbie Houston and what she's about. It's the whole idea of women celebrating each other's wins and journeying through life together.
