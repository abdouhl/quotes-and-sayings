- I'm a massive daydreamer. I'm constantly lost within my own fantasies and my own thoughts personally, and I think maybe that is sort of represented in what we do for a living, the fact that we make believe everything and we escape into these other characters for a living.
- What we're supposed to do as actors is be able to portray real human beings and emotions. And if you grow up in this bubble of showbiz and you only know people who make movies, you don't really have an understanding of the world outside.
- When you act, you really have to give all of yourself, and if you're doing that purely for money, it's not healthy.
- In my everyday life I'm a little bit nervous and not particularly brave. I feel like if I can be completely brave in my work then I'm doing something right.

- It is frustrating when in an interview people say: 'Give us your make-up tips' and 'How do you stay skinny?' I think: 'Do you ask a guy that?'
- I tend to over-analyse things. I'm not the type of person to flip a coin and let things happen.

- The thing is, I actually feel a lot more comfortable at school just bumming around with my friends than I do at Hollywood parties. But then, I guess you're just never happy with what you have.
- For me it would be unhealthy to be a method actor; I'm not mentally stable enough for that - I need to separate my two worlds.
- A strange thing happens to me that I'm sure happens to a lot of actors when the camera starts rolling. I'm not 'me' any more.
- After Hollywood, you know if people are interested in you or in the fact that you've been in a movie. You know who your real friends are.
