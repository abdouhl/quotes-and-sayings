- I've been on 'Hollyoaks' since I was 15, and I've grown up on the show. I'm so very fortunate to be given the opportunity to learn my craft in such a fantastic environment.
- My mum took me to the ballet at three, and that was the only time I sat still, with jaw open, mesmerised. She brought me home, and I wouldn't stop dancing.
- I did really well at school, and I would have loved to have gone to Oxford or Cambridge. I would have read English, and I'm really interested in politics.
- I love gritty drama. I'm passionate about films and drama that make you think - hard-hitting, gravelly characters.
- I've always been a performer. I love doing impressions of people and being the clown.
- When you're in a soap, it's fantastic, and I'm really grateful for the fans who watch you and support you. For me, it was the best experience because I was able to act every day and work with so many different directors and get some great storylines and learn on-screen.
