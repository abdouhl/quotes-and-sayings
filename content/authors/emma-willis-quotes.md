- I don't deprive myself. I eat chocolate most nights and if there's a cake knocking around I'll have it. And I do like Nando's.
- I think what you get with the voice is that people can actually sing. The entertainment you get is not only from the contestants but also from the coaches.
- It wasn't love at first sight with Matt - we were friends at the beginning, and our friendship developed.
- I won't wear anything very short. I don't do that thing.
- I enjoy getting older, because people take you more seriously.
- I don't believe in telling girls to mess with their bodies. Be healthy, be happy, be a decent person, enjoy yourself - that's more important.
- It boils down to this: do they have the ability? If they want to be a singer and have a good voice, then yes. I would support them in it 100 per cent. But I see so many people who are delusional, and I would tell my kids if it wasn't a realistic goal.
- I'm not a big fan of antiques shows or 'Cash In The Attic.' I don't care about the rubbish in your loft! I don't find it stimulating in any way.
- I met Matt when he was in Busted. I was working at MTV and I'd see him wearing baggy jeans, waddling around like a duck so they didn't fall down. He used to wear makeup and have weird hairstyles. But I remember thinking underneath all that was a really cute guy.
- I just want to live as long as possible because I have three children and a husband that I don't want to leave.
- Compared to somebody who goes to work every single day in an office from nine til six, I'm lucky. I see my kids every day, I get a lot of time with them.
- I couldn't believe my first job at the BBC was going to be a primetime show. I was baffled at first: 'Are you sure you've got the right Emma?!'
- If anyone says, 'Does anyone have any ideas on this?' I sometimes think, 'I'm not going to say that because it's stupid.' But now I'm like, 'Actually, I can have an idea and if it's not right, it's not right.' I'm a grown adult and I'm allowed to have an opinion or an idea.
- I think you can always learn from a little bit of negativity.
- For me, Venus are the experts in keeping my legs smooth, and offer a wide range of razors to ensure I have the right tool for the right time for the best results.
- I'm a terrible skier and snowboarder but I still love it. But I also love lying around in the sun, eating good food and doing nothing.
- The older I've got, the better my relationship with my body has become, and that's because of my mindset.
- The biggest thing I have learnt is not to overdo make-up - less is more.
- Being 40 and pregnant with my third child, it's no surprise that the cellulite on my legs got out of control.
- I always worry that there's not going to be another job.
- I've never been one to jump into fitness straight after having a baby. I always say if you grow it for nine months it should take that time at least to go back to normal.
- I see my parents getting older and I think 'How can I prevent what is going to happen to me?'
- My main thing is being comfortable and looking like myself. But to be honest, what I wear is pretty much the last thing I think about.
- I truly believe being a midwife is the greatest job for a feminist. It's women helping women, believing in them at a time when they're thinking, 'Am I ever going to get through this?'
- Children are fearless and honest, they are the best people to watch. There's no falseness.
- I'm a worrier. I worry about everything - I worry about the kids, my family, my health, Matt's health. I always think the worst - and he keeps me calm, he's really optimistic. He's a constant support with everything.
- When it comes to beauty in particular I think it's really important to choose brands that have real and genuine expertise. Brand that I trust.
- Yes I'm a TV presenter and a mum and a wife and all those things, but as much as I love a duvet day with my family, I also like rockclimbing and getting dressed up for a glamorous evening now and then.
- Social media can be incredibly damaging for impressionable people.
- I will allow myself guilt-free time, because I don't do very often and it's allowed. It's healthy for your mind.
- What I've learnt is that being a midwife is not a job about cute babies. And as a maternity care assistant there's a lot of cleaning involved. It's a vocation.
- To combat jet lag, when you get to your destination go straight to a park, take your shoes off and walk barefoot. It's something to do with having your feet in contact with the earth - it's supposed to be grounding.
- The idea of being a role model is bizarre.
- The biggest change I notice in the winter months is with my skin. I find all the cold weather and central heating leaves it feeling more dull, dry and easily irritated. So for me, finding little ways to make my skincare routine work harder is my winter beauty priority.
- On 'Voice Kids' we were always so conscious to really take care of the kids and their families throughout the process. But to be honest the kids took it more in their stride.
- When you've had kids it gives you confidence - you think, 'I'm a mum. I'm not scared. If I can raise a human being, I can do this.'
- The first time I did 'The Voice,' I was honestly terrified. You're with Tom Jones and Will.i.am, seriously mega-talented people, and I felt like I was winging it. Then you realise everyone is in it together.
- It's funny because, when I was younger, my body was 'better,' but I was more insecure about it. Then, in my 30s, I had children, so I loved my body because of what it had produced.
- I feel like I know myself, who I am, what I'm doing. What I'm good at and what I'm not good at.
- It's lovely I have 'Big Brother' and 'The Voice,' so that's two regular jobs I love. But even before then, when I wasn't working and I couldn't find work, if something was offered to me and it didn't feel right, I wouldn't take it.
- Perfection doesn't exist.
- I think there are moments when everyone feels a bit low or goes through tough times.
- I love John McCririck. Not a lot of people say that! Part of his misogynistic ways are very real, but part of it is a little act.
- I have a bit of a dodgy back so I'm trying my best to to keep it strong. Lots of squats and dead lifting.
- The main thing going through my head when I step out onto any show is: 'Don't mess it up, Emma, don't mess it up.'
- It's never easy. You think you're ready but nothing prepares you. You're knocked for six. No matter how much you want a baby, having one's totally different.
- In 2005, not long after I met Matt, MTV decided not to renew my contract. It meant that I didn't have a job or any money. We lived together and he supported me because I had nothing.
- I was always a shy kid.
- Be proud to be unique!
- I am very lucky to do the things I do like - do a clothing line for Next and go live out a life I always thought I would have.
- I'm just not a glamourpuss dollybird.
- Having the chance to model was completely unexpected. I wasn't very girly, but it was an adventure and it changed my life for ever.
- I hydrate my legs by mixing a body oil with moisturiser and I apply it evenly all over my legs to seal in moisture. For a special occasion I might have a spray tan, which gives my skin a nice glow.
- I'm not a great networker.
- What I have done is always try to be nice to work with. I make the best impression, try to do a good job... and if people hire me again, it's for the right reasons.
- Nobody wants to hear horrible things about themselves.
- If money were no object I'd bring back 'Treasure Hunt!' With a helicopter and me. I think it could be updated - you could do something for a community that needs some help.
- I've got the recognised care certificate, which everyone has to achieve to be able to get a job in a hospital. So, I've got a backup plan now!
- I eat a healthy diet and try to be gluten-free - my body functions better without it.
- I really rely on knowing how to apply make-up properly, rather than slapping it on and hoping for the best.
- I tell my children they're beautiful, but that's more about their character as the way they look. We never talk about size or what's 'normal,' as everyone is unique. And I definitely don't mention things that might worry me about my own body in front of them.
- Midwives absolutely do not get paid enough. When you think about what they are doing - you can't put a price on that.
- Growing up, I was always quite shy and I was quite scared of having an opinion on things, so I just wouldn't say anything.
- You have to find a balance between work and family. And I have help. I have an amazing family who chip in.
- The thing I live by is: trust your gut.
- There's nothing worse than someone saying 'wear this' and it not being you.
- I am slim but I've got a lot of wobble! I wear tight clothes and it holds it all in but genuinely I'm covered in cellulite - that's why I almost never wear skirts.
- If my children want a career in the entertainment industry that's fine - as long as it's realistic.
- I had a blonde perm when I was a teenager.
- Seeing what midwives do on a day-to-day basis - you really have this renewed respect for them.
- I always like to have a few wardrobe options to try to see what I feel best in on the day and so preparation is key - it could be trousers, a dress, or I do love a skirt and top, so I have to be prepared.
- I always say to my friends that are pregnant, I'll be there don't you worry, everything's going to be ok, if you're with me you'll be fine.
- I've always thought doing 'Strictly' would be amazing. they all look so incredible at the end, but the hours you have to put in are insane.

- I know we both have very unusual jobs, but we manage just like any other parents.
- I wanted to work in a hospital because that's what I knew from my mum's career.
- I was about to get on a plane and take my husband away for his birthday, I thought oh I have tummy ache. I went into A&E and they said 'oh, you need surgery,' it was really weird - it was appendicitis.
- I took on 'What Would Be Your Miracle' because I wanted to do something far removed from 'Big Brother' and 'The Voice.'
- I am a mum - I want to give my kids confidence, but limit it because no one wants arrogance.
- After I gave birth to Isabelle I thought my body would never heal. But it is true what they say: I would go through that amount of pain again for this amount of joy.
- I would love to take care of myself and look like Victoria Beckham every time I leave the house. But for me that is not realistic.
- I do all over body workouts, HIIT classes, boxing and lots of leg and back work.
- Even when I was a model, I was like, 'How am I doing this?' I think it's partly that I've grown up in a normal place, living a very normal working-class life and this doesn't happen to people like me.
- I think having been a pregnant woman, or having just given birth, you are just so thankful for any help you can get immediately before and after.
- When I was 18 I went to Australia for work and I remember an agent telling me I was too fat. I wasn't fat, or heavy - or even skinny, I was just normal with a round face.
- My only opinion on childbirth is not to have an opinion, and not to judge. We're all different and anything can happen when it comes to labour: you just don't know until you get there.
- My 'I can' comes from confidence really, because I'm not an overly confident person.
- Sometimes our date nights are just spontaneous.
- I'm not afraid to wear jeans and trainers under my dress!
- I have one friend who I don't think has a mean bone in her body and I find that very bizarre. I can't imagine her ever flying off the handle, whereas I will.
- In a parallel universe I am delivering babies or working on a children's ward. TV was my plan B really - plan A was always medicine.
- The best thing about working with kids is that they are so open and honest that you sort of know where they stand and can act accordingly.
- I like to wear jeans, Converse and a sweater, so from the back I can sometimes look like a boy!
- For me, I have to have a genuine love for something, or I feel like I look like a fraud or a fake.
- I am in no way, shape or form perfect.
- I'm a very positive person, but I'm a realist too.
- While I was living in New York a friend and I flew to Miami and travelled through a storm. I could see lightning strikes through the window. I grabbed my friend's hand tightly and kept repeating: 'We're going to die! We're going to die!' Thank goodness he was there as I don't know what I'd have done if I was on my own.
- Preparation is key - and that's everything from packed lunches the night before to self-tan and eyebrow dye. So once a week I try to put on a layer of gradual self-tan. I also tint my eyebrows once a week with a kit. That makes a huge difference as I have quite sparse eyebrows and it makes me seem more groomed and defined.
- I was 18 years old and a size 10 when I started modelling, but I was told to lose weight right away.
- I was a huge fan of 'Treasure Hunt' and 'Challenge Anneka.'
