- There's always a high school jerk, isn't there? But I didn't date much in high school, because I went to an all-girls' private school for ten years.
- Would I put my daughter in a private all-girl school? No. Would I put her in a private co-ed school? Yes. Would I put her in the school I went to? No way.
- When I have a little down time, I like to go to the gym and try to bank some hours there. I like to spend time with my dogs, go hiking, do a little traveling.
- I like animals, I really do, but some animals are just meant to be eaten.
- When I was modeling in Japan, I could blend in a little because of my hair, but my roommates with blonde hair got harassed. People would touch their hair and grope them in the subway. Actually, a lot of groping happens in the subway in Japan, but that's probably true of subways everywhere.
- I love to go hiking. I hike every day for about 1 1/2 to 2 hours in the hills around LA. I go to the gym every day, too.
- Horror movies have never been my thing. I love psychological thrillers like 'The Exorcist', 'The Shining', even though they scare the living daylights out of me.
