- I am proud that Ireland is playing its part to drive an ambitious and comprehensive agreement at COP21.
- We've got enormous potential, phenomenal potential on our doorstep, which requires politics that makes that work, and that's what we try to show here in Ireland: that while there's a lot of pain, the reward at the end of this is career opportunities, prosperity, and brighter days for everybody.
