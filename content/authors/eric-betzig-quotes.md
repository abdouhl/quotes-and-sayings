- In essence, we're imaging the same cell for anywhere from forty to a hundred thousand times to create one of the movies that we see.
- It takes a huge amount of effort to move from a successful high-tech prototype to broader adoption of an imaging technology.
- Like you can't have a car that can take the kids to schools on Friday and win the grand prix on Saturday, you can't make a microscope that can do it all.
- It always irritated me that people think they have to be locked into a career path.
- I'm spoiled. All of my adult jobs have left me with complete freedom to come up with what I wanted.
- You need a continuous picture of how things are evolving, and not a slow series of snapshots where you don't know how frame A is related to frame B.
- In my opinion, the only real asset one has is one's reputation, right? I mean, any company and institution can go belly up at any time. But if you have a good reputation, you know, you can usually find somebody who can - who thinks they can use what you have to offer.
- Sometimes I make an analogy that each scientific paper is like putting out another record. And some people have careers that are nothing but a one-hit wonder. And then there are people who are only appreciated by aficionados but largely forgotten by the wider community.
- What was shocking to us was that by spreading the energy out across seven beams instead of one, the phototoxicity went way down.
- One thing I liked about being in microscopy is it gets you out of your box constantly because there's such a diverse range of applications.
- There are many cells you could look at forever in 3D.
- Every new invention is like a baby. You think it may cure cancer or become the president, but in the end, you're happy it just stays out of jail.
- You get so tied up with the minutiae of the day-to-day, there's never a chance to sit back and let your subconscious run wild.
- Honestly, I feel you are poisoned if you read too much of the scientific literature because it makes you start thinking like other people. You're better off having a vague sense of what's going on and making your own way.
- I was born in 1960 and can still tell you the name of every astronaut from Mercury to Apollo. If I had a chance, I'd love to go into space on one of the privately developed space crafts.
- When I listen to music from different eras, I sense different things. The 1940s music, there's so much optimism and romance, maybe because they just solved the biggest problem on Earth at that time - World War II. In the 1960s, there was so much creativity and innovation in sound.
- I hate driving a bandwagon.
- I missed the basic curiosity of being in the lab.
- Frankly, I guess, I don't really understand why people, why so many people, are so risk averse. You know, there's always ways to wiggle your way out of any situation if you're motivated enough.
- The eventual goal is to marry all of my work together to make a high-speed, high-resolution, low-impact tool that can look deep inside biological systems.
- Science goes through fads, and there are big ups and crashes.
- Chemistry was always my weakest subject in high school and college.
- There's always something that an engineer can do to make microscopes better.
- I really didn't like the academic structure of science, but I realized I loved science and missed science.
- The question was, 'Is there a way of minimizing the amount of damage you're doing so that you can then study cells in a physiological manner while also studying them at high spatial and temporal resolution for a long time?'
- I don't like saying 'no' to people, and I'm going to have to learn how to say 'no' more.
- We can track and see the production of single molecules, trace them and see how they assemble into structures.
- It's nice to be able to look at one protein, but life is driven by the interactions between proteins, so it's really essential to be able to see multiple proteins at a time to understand these interactions.
