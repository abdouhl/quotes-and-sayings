- I have two bowls of confidence for breakfast each morning.
- I don't read books.
- I was born at the right time. I was a freak - the only young player when darts took off in the 1970s.
- Ever since I've been 16, 15, that's all I've been doing: playing darts.
- I remember when we were in the World Cup in Australia and I had to win the singles against Tony Payne, best of seven legs, to win it. I was 2-0 down but ended up beating him 4-2.
- My dad bought me a dartboard for my 11th birthday, and I became intrigued by the game.
- I've got a nice little crafty deal with the people in Barbados; 10 days out there teaching the locals how to play darts for an hour a day. Get paid for that as well.
- The Crafty Cockney had a picture of the owner dressed up as a copper, so I brought it home, wore it on TV and the name just stuck.
- Mark my words, Michael Van Gerwen will knock Phil Taylor off his perch one day and be the best darts player on the planet.
- I play a lot of charity golf mainly. I'm a bandit 18 if I play two or three times a week.
- You can't drink too many otherwise you can't see what you're throwing at.
- Any sport where people earn a lot of money you are going to get groupies.
- By the time I was 25 or 26, I would have earned a million, but if you looked in the bank account, it's not there because I've spent it. That's what it's there for. I don't want to be the richest bloke in the graveyard. Look at Elvis.
- When Phil Taylor is in the field - no matter whether it's tiddlywinks or the world championship at Alexandra Palace - he is the man to beat.
- I love cheese and biscuits, the stronger the better.
- I was 15 when I got my first job as a proofreader for an advertising agency in the City, earning £12 a week. But by then, I was already playing darts tournaments every weekend, regularly winning the £50 first prize. By the time I was 16 and winning two or three contests a weekend, I ditched the agency job and concentrated on darts.
- My dad was an Arsenal supporter and he used to take me there, but I've always been Chelsea.
- It's all right buying all these good players but they've got to gel, and that takes time.
- It took me about 10 years to get rid of. I'm all right now, though, lovely, I'm throwing some nice darts at the moment, but every now and then I get a bit of a jump. I wish I could find a cure, I'd make a bloody fortune.
- I like a drink, mate. I'll have maybe 10 or 12 pints on a good night out.
- You eat when you're hungry, and I'm not normally hungry in the mornings.
- Hopefully I've given something back to darts, which has been brilliant to me. Hopefully I made it a bit popular when I first started; I was part of the breakaway, and I also created a monster, so I think I've done a little bit.
- In 1987 I got dartitis, a psychological condition which means you can't let your darts go properly. For a time, I wondered what the hell I was going to do if I didn't recover. But I remained positive and, thankfully, got over it. It occurred during the Swedish Open when I found I couldn't let the darts go.
- Trouble is, I don't get to play a lot at the moment because I've just signed a contract where I've got to do 200 shows a year in pubs, so the golf's fallen away a bit.
- I'm not on Twitter or Facebook and don't even use email. I don't trust computers: one day they'll all break down, and everyone will be knackered.
- Nah, I don't watch TV either, apart from a few sports programmes. I just don't have the time.
- When it comes to spending, I don't splash out on fancy cars - I never have. I'm not a car man and, in fact, don't even drive. Although I own a vehicle - it only cost £3,000, and I can't even tell you the make - friends are kind enough to drive me around. It doesn't make sense to waste lots of money on cars.
- All this cuddling and kissing on stage these days, well it's all right in football when someone scores a goal, but not when you're playing darts.
- I knew I didn't want to be stuck in Stoke Newington for the rest of my life, hanging about with idiots. That wasn't for me. I wanted to go out and have a look around.
