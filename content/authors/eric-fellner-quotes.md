- Making movies is like herding cats.
- It's fantastic to see 'Les Miserables' become the top-grossing film at the U.K. box office.
- 'Billy Elliot' prides itself on being a family show, and it made sense to specifically cater to a family audience with an earlier evening curtain time.
- When you watch a Coen brothers movie, it is always so certain about what it is trying to portray. That is their strength. The minute they write a word, they know how it will look on-screen. They are very purposeful, with no kind of mistakes.
- If there's a British film in the marketplace that is successful on a worldwide basis - whether it's 'A Room with a View,' 'Four Weddings' or 'The Full Monty' - money follows, and everyone tries to emulate that success.
- Film is not a national business. It's international. And its centre will always be Hollywood.
- You never get time at Working Title, sadly, to enjoy any film's success, because you're worrying about the next lot.
- There's so much competition for leisure time, more than ever.
- With 'Anna Karenina,' I just think it's a stunning visual tour de force for a director who is at the top of his game.
- My theory is, I don't know how long it's going to be, five or ten years, there will be only two ways to see a movie, and that will either be on your computer through your TV screen or in the cinema, end of story. There will be no DVD; that's it - simple.
- For us in England, the relative value of the pound against the dollar, that has a huge impact on how easy it is to get our films made in the U.K.
- You can't develop a great car and sell it as an independent. You can develop a great car and make a deal with Mercedes.
- The U.K. needs more first class studio space to encourage the growth of the film and TV sector.
- The idea that the Tony committee and the New York theater community as a whole have embraced 'Billy Elliot' is very, very exciting.
- I'm a blind optimist when going into things.
- Technical problems are like gremlins. They come and go.
- I have always thought we should think less about the British film industry as an entity, and more about getting British talent working.
- The more you keep costs down, the more freedom you have creatively.
- It might sound a small thing, but if you want to get Tom Cruise into your movie, without a track record or without those agents knowing you, it's almost impossible. Now I can get through to pretty much anyone I want. Of course, 90 per cent of the time they still say no.
- 'Billy Elliot' embodies the idea that anyone can achieve anything regardless of their socio-economic background.
- Mike Leigh and Ken Loach are the people I look up to. They are quality film-makers making interesting, controversial, ground-breaking movies with very little eye on the marketplace.
- I think Cannes is usually pretty fair in choosing what will play well to the home festival crowd.
- Do we have good writers, producers and actors in the U.K.? Yes we do.
- Apart from 'Stoned,' I can't think of a film that's made me think, 'Blimey, that should have been at Cannes.'
- I think it would be a good thing in the creative community if there was less embarrassment of this word 'commercial' because that's how you make a business.
- Somebody has to invest in creating the movies of the future.
- 'No Country for Old Men' was epic.
- It is rare that you read scripts that genuinely move you and make you feel that, regardless of the commercial possibilities, you have to make the film.
- You can get swept away by a musical, but real tears are rare.
- The writer Richard Curtis is a genius.
