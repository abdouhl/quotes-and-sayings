- I wanted to be a New York City cop before I became an actor.
- My grandfather taught me generosity. He sold snow cones in Harlem. I went with him at 5 and he let me hand out the change and snow cones. I learned a lot in the couple of years that we did that.
- 'Top Model' is pretty good, because it gives these girls an opportunity to chase their passion and possibly get a contract.
- I'm a deputy sheriff.
- I like working with an actor who doesn't do the oneupmanship. One who has no trick and gives a true, honest performance.
- I really love the karate thing I did on CHIPs. I studied with a trainer because I knew we'd do episodes that had karate.
- As a Latino growing up in Spanish harlem, it's not easy trying not to be hot-headed.
- National Geographic has awesome stuff. I like Court TV. Sometimes I'll watch Reality Mix because they have some interesting stuff on that.
- Sergio Leone's 'Once Upon a Time in America' is a brilliant movie. It's about four hours long, but it's so well done.
- It was a hard job, but it was a lot of fun and I'll always be grateful to Ponch. He was a part of me.

- I do get a lot of mail. I get a lot of foreign mail because my mail gets mixed with Emilio Estevez.
- I grew up in New York in an English-speaking environment.
- Playing a positive role on a network television show, it was great. I took it as a responsibility. Poncherello was supposed to be Poncherelli, and then when I got this part I said, 'You know what, this guy isn't going to be Italian-American, he's gonna be Hispanic American.' And they went with it.
- This happens to a lot of kids from different backgrounds - they lose a lot of their parents' and grandparents' teachings, language and culture because they have to deal with another language and culture 24/7. By the time I was 44, I was terrible at Spanish. I was always intimidated whenever I had to speak it.
- My new passion is to get Internet education mandated in all schools. We've got to start teaching our kids how to be safe in the 40,000 plus chat rooms that are out there. Because they're being had. These sexual predators groom the kids. I know, I've arrested enough of them.
- Listen, the Latin people, I love the Latin people. They are so loyal to you. Even if you haven't been on TV for thirty years, they still love you. And they cherish you and give you respect. You're not fast food in the Latin market.
- I like to watch the Fox News Network. I like 'Nightline.' I like to watch 'The Sopranos,' of course. That is one of my favorite shows. 'Entourage' is another one. I like 'The Shield.'
- Long time ago, I was going to be a New York cop, then got involved with this girl who was into acting, then got bit by the acting bug myself.
- An hour of my time is a tiny price to pay for all the support I've gotten from my fans.
- Oh my God... I worked with George C. Scott, way before 'Chips,' in 'The New Centurion.' I co-star in that movie. It was great working with him. I worked with Charlton Heston, Glenn Ford, Robert Mitchum. Stacy Each. The old Hollywood. I met John Wayne, and that was a thrill. I was working next door to him.
