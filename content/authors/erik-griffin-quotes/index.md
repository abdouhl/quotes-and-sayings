- Sometimes comedy can be, like, negative and just the worst parts of ourselves coming out.
- New York is great because it's such a cross-section of the world, and when you're used to people being shoulder-to-shoulder all the time - in the street, on the train - you become a people person. People are very open to hearing a lot of different perspectives, and they aren't as sensitive.
- I take the good with the bad. I always wanted to be a comic, and part of that, for me, was that I wanted to be on the road. It's a lonely existence, but it is what it is.
- Women are hilarious.
- My inspiration to do comedy came from many places. Saturday mornings, I would watch Bob Hope and Jerry Lewis movies. I later got into watching stand-ups like Eddie Murphy, who was my main inspiration.
- I love doing stand-up, and the more you do outside of stand-up to raise your profile, the better your stand-up becomes in terms of the quality of gigs.
- I started going to the open mics every day in 2003. You make the comics laugh, they get you work, and you build up your reputation. It was a slow process.
- I look stupid without a mustache.
- We need more female voices to come out there and do comedy.
- I think the best compliment you can receive is not, 'Oh, that was really funny,' but, 'Is that the first time you said that?' It's something that you've said a thousand times, but if somebody says to you, 'Oh my God, is that the first time you've done that?' you know that performance was where you wanted it.
- Admitted mama's boy here - put that on the record.
- Most of the time, the truth is ugly and in your face! My observational brand of humor is very much all in your face!
- 'Workaholics' seems like it's doing wonders for my career.
- People don't realize it's not just about being funny, and they don't know how perceptive a comedian needs to be about human nature. You have to really be able to read a situation and peoples' emotions.
- It's not like every male comic you meet is funny. Like, a lot of them are not funny.
- I was born and raised in Los Angeles.
- I'm not really a current events guy, sadly.
- I don't believe anything is truly off limits, but as a performer, one has to know that people might be offended, and there are consequences.
- 'The Ugly Truth' isn't trying to change the world with strong political opinions; it's just trying to entertain you with thoughts and ideas from my crazy mind!
- When they first start doing comedy, new comics or even people that have only been doing it three or four years, they're doing an impersonation of a stand-up. This is what I think a stand-up should sound like.
