- I would love to work with the Coen brothers and Terrence Malick. I love both of their bodies of work so much, so I'm really interested in acting under their direction.
- My parents are both very stylish, so they always encouraged me to explore when it came to personal style. I went through a lot of crazy phases, and I'm still finding myself.
- Throughout high school, I was fairly boring. I didn't do many rebellious things.
- Jordan Vogt-Roberts directed me in 'Kings of Summer,' which was his debut feature. I got to witness the passion and hunger that first-time directors bring to projects, and ever since, then I've been very intrigued when I've come across a project with a less experienced director.
- 'Fargo' definitely makes it into my top three favorite films of all time; I have a serious obsession with the Coen brothers.
- I love romantic comedies... but they have to be done right, but when they are, they're great.
