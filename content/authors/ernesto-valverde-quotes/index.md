- Historically, Barcelona win La Liga when they win the Champions League.
- As far as enthusiasm goes, yes, certain games maybe bring more out of the players.
- The decisions you make are based on what you think is better for the team and the player.
- I don't like to talk about players from other teams, just like I wouldn't like it if the opposition coach talked about my team. It's a question of respect.
- I would like to have an assortment of words, but what can I say about Leo? He is breaking all the records, and those he will still beat. He makes the public always expect something special from him, and he delivers it.
- Training isn't the same as playing.
- I would have given my arm to be able to do what Iniesta does when I was a player.
- I know what it's like to be in a difficult situation, where the results do not come in.
- Good players always adapt well.
- Just as I don't like it when other coaches question my squads and my line-ups, I won't talk about others.
- I'm not aware of any plans for a European Super League, but the Champions League is a Super League.
- There is something fundamental about Leo in terms of what he transmits to the supporters and what he transmits to the opposition when he starts to run at you. And I speak from experience.
- I think it's something each team has to decide on, but I think the guard of honour is supposed to be a way of paying tribute to the opposing players.
- When you sign a contract with a club like Barca, that's what you have to cope with. You have to show your face when you've lost games. I knew that when I came into the job.
- Dembele likes to take players on. He's a dribbler and a power player who likes to break into space; he has the ability to do this. He has a lot of virtues.
- Of course there is 'Messidependence.' It would exist in any team in the world, but when he is not there, we also have to play and try to win. Leo is fundamental for us and marks the style; it is well known that he is the best in the world for something.
- Wins are big boosts for your confidence, but sometimes you don't notice little things. When you lose a game, it means that the opponent has had a plan, and it's worked - now we need to see our capacity for response.
- All matches have a high difficulty level.
- When the opposition sits back and defends well and together, it's difficult.
- When Messi plays the ball, everybody expects many things from him. Sometimes it's too much because we have to let Messi breathe a bit.
- I don't like to see any coach get sacked - not Lopetegui, not the Huesca coach, not the Granada coach, and, of course, not the Barca coach.
- Sometimes results mean something, as there are difficulties, but it depends how you play. You might not win, as you don't create chances, or you might dominate and not take your chances.
- We all want our players to be perfect and never make errors, but we all do. Even coaches.
- It's true that Coutinho played on the centre because sometimes Messi likes playing on the right side. If that happens, we have to readjust a bit.
- We all know how management works. If you don't win things, as has happened before, people start to call for your head.
- Football is a game of errors. You want to make your rivals commit them and to avoid them yourself.
- Liverpool are a very powerful opponent.
- Positional play is good for training, but in games, to win matches, you need someone who can go past defenders and take chances.
- Getafe is an uncomfortable rival for Barca and for anyone. They are experts in winning second balls.
- Atletico is a rival who will never give up.
- Messi always gets us out of trouble, and we're not going to apologise for having him.
- Dembele has things that nobody else in the squad has - self-confidence, one against one, shooting with both feet, personality.
- I know the names of possible signings get fans excited, but it's a very fleeting kind of excitement.
- Messi is just extraordinary.
- Ronaldo leaving would seem to have ended the competition between Leo Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo because people rarely mention one without mentioning the other. A lot of people are interested - me, too - to see how it will affect Real Madrid's football and what they might do in the transfer market.
- If you win a game, everyone is happy, and if you lose, everyone is watching you.
- I never think long or long term.
- The great thing about football is that it's so fast, there are so few interruptions.
- Everyone has their own opinion. They can state it publicly, or not if they don't like to, but for me, the best players are here at Barcelona, starting with Lionel Messi and followed by everyone else.
- When you lose is when you learn the most.
- Every player has to find their place, their form, and play well.
- Xavi is one of the best players in the history of football.
- Umtiti is a great player, and we expect him to stay at Barca for many more years and for him to enjoy his football with us.
- A derby is always special.
- Everything is always equal between every player; no one is ahead of anyone. Sometimes one player plays, then others play. It's normal at every club, not just Barca.
- My future at Barca does not matter to me. I do not care.
- Every player is free to decide over their future, just like the clubs can decide who they keep.
- Sometimes there's too much noise about what's happening, but this is Barcelona - it is a big club. Sometimes people make more of things than they have to. We need to try to close the team away from all that noise outside.
- You know how things go in football. Seasons are long, and you have to see how things progress.
- With big clubs, it's always very demanding.
- Dembele is a player who has been playing regularly, from the bench or the start, and he has quality. When he comes off the bench, he can change a game, and that's a quality that is undervalued in football. Not everybody has that quality.
- Over the season, the games come thick and fast, and in some games, you aren't so lucky.
- You cannot talk to a player who has a contract. It's not in my code.
- In regard to criticism, we are in the world of football and subject to continuous criticism.
- Messi is the same player in Barcelona and Argentina, and it would be the same if he played with Australia.
- Winning the UCL is really difficult. Only one team can win it, so it's very difficult.
- I never let myself forget that our rivals are waiting for us to slip up and feed their hope of catching us.
- Everyone loves playing in semi-finals and finals.
- I do not think it is very easy to win away from home in the Champions League.
- Technology is going to be good for football, but it will take time to adjust. The important thing is that the games have rhythm; at the beginning, it will be complicated, but there are plays that require it.
- Football is a game of emotions.
- It's never easy to find players in the market who are exactly what you need at that time.

- I try to play with balance.
- There's no problem with a guard of honour in any way.
- Villarreal have played well against difficult opponents. They're never an easy team to beat.
- Throughout the season, you have days when you are more fortunate than others.
- We prioritise everything. We will always fight for the Champions League. Barca will always be like that - we are very excited - but the way to win the Champions League is to win the league.
- It is good to win because it boosts you in what you're doing and allows you to start the season in a positive way.
- Everything is focused on the coach. It's what happens in football.
- What I'd most highlight about Leo Messi is his huge sense of responsibility for the team. It shows in every game in every competition.
- During the season, there are all types of games - ones where you deserve more than you get and ones where you get more than you deserve.
- The feeling is that video assistant referees and technology are here to help us, especially for justice in the penalty area.
- Iniesta teaches you something in every match.
