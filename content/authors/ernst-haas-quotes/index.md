- I am not interested in shooting new things - I am interested to see things new.
- Bored with obvious reality, I find my fascination in transforming it into a subjective point of view.
- With photography a new language has been created. Now for the first time it is possible to express reality by reality. We can look at an impression as long as we wish, we can delve into it and, so to speak, renew past experiences at will.
- There is only you and your camera. The limitations in your photography are in yourself, for what we see is what we are.
- All I wanted was to connect my moods with those of Paris. Beauty paints and when it painted most, I shot.
- A picture is the expression of an impression. If the beautiful were not in us, how would we ever recognize it?
- Without touching my subject I want to come to the moment when, through pure concentration of seeing, the composed picture becomes more made than taken. Without a descriptive caption to justify its existence, it will speak for itself - less descriptive, more creative; less informative, more suggestive - less prose, more poetry.
