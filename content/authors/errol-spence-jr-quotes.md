- If I don't have headphones, I can't run. Nowadays, I listen to Drake, Future, and Boosie.
- I am ready for a title unification fight with Keith Thurman and hope to be ready before too long for a move up to light-middleweight to meet Canelo Alvarez.
- I don't think there's any extra pressure fighting in my hometown. It's just added motivation. Real pressure was fighting against 30,000 fans in the champion's hometown for my first title against Kell Brook.
- I want Keith Thurman. He has two of the belts, and we both have big names. It's an easy fight to make, and I want it.
- No disrespect to Ugas. He's a great fighter, and he's ranked in the IBF, so I'm gonna have to fight him. But, you know, I'm looking to build my legacy and me beating Ugas is not gonna get me anywhere.
- There's a lot of fighters that pop up out of the blue that you never heard of. They just don't have the management or the promotion team or the spotlight, you know, to be seen. That's the ones you've gotta watch out for.
- Kell Brook is a strong fighter. He likes to dictate the pace, which most boxers like to do. He likes to use his jab to set up other punches, like the left hook.
- I don't believe in talking when you have the number of the person who can make that fight happen. If you really want it, you know who to call.
- I want to be the undisputed champion of the world.
- It's just my character, naturally. I don't really talk that much. It's just who I am. I just back it up in the ring. There is no need to talk... I'm not the guy who rambles.
- Terence Crawford being across the street - I can't promise it's going to happen this year, but it's going to happen.
- Kell Brook has a lot of heart. He showed it against Golovkin and when he came over here to the States and fought Shawn Porter. He's a real warrior in the ring.
- I still have much to learn, especially about my defence.
- When I was a kid, I thought I was going to be playing for the Cowboys.
- Bundu is a very good fighter. He's experienced and technically sound, but he can be awkward.
- Any fighter who's willing to step up, I'm willing to fight them. I'm ready to rule with an iron fist.
- My motto is 'Man Down,' and I have to live up to it. I don't go in looking for the knockout, but I let it happen naturally.
- I'm a boxing fan. I've seen Kell Brook fight. I'm not one of those boxers who says he doesn't watch other guys fight or follow the sport. I do.
- I still can improve a lot on my defense. I just have to keep perfecting my skills and keep progressing. You're going to see a better Errol Spence next time I get in the ring.
- Mexican fighters have a great tradition. They come to fight, and they don't back down.
- At the end of the day, I feel like me and Keith Thurman is the fight to make. A lot of people bring up Terence Crawford since Keith Thurman's been inactive.
- I wanted to play for the Dallas Cowboys, and now I'm fighting in front of the Dallas Cowboys and Jerry Jones.
- I just look for another spectacular fight, another spectacular one-sided performance.
- When I say we're on different side of the streets, it's true. Me and Terence Crawford are on different side of the streets.
- Putting up a great performance against Lamont Peterson will skyrocket me. The goal is to become the No. 1 welterweight in the division, so if I keep beating these guys around me and then fight Keith Thurman, people will rate me as No. 1 because I've beat the top names, and he's been inactive.
- It doesn't matter how many sit-ups you do, your work ethic. I know when I land that punch, and I'm on balance, they're going to feel it regardless of how strong their core is.
- When I become the undisputed champion of the world, then I'll move up to 154.
- I have a lot of big names on my side that I'm willing to fight, and I'm pretty sure they are willing to fight me, too.
- Ocampo is very dangerous because he has nothing to lose. I want a guy who's going to test me so the crowd gets its money's worth.
- I want to fight every opponent and take them out, no matter who it is. I'm here to prove I'm the best in the division.
- Once I get an opponent, I'm locked into him.
- Of course I would want the knockout, but with me, I just look for, you know, a spectacular performance. It's like, walk them down, or go for the knockout. You know, hopefully I get the knockout.
- We have to keep winning and looking good and keep fighting the best competition out there.
- I'm from the old school, where I want to fight the best. I want to reign supreme over all of them. I'm willing to fight all of them to prove all of that.
- If Keith Thurman comes back, and he has a great fight and he shows what he's been showing in the fights with Danny Garcia and Shawn Porter, everyone is going to talk about Errol Spence vs. Keith Thurman.
- I want to fight every opponent and take them out, no matter who it is. I'm here to prove that I'm the best in the division.
- I got family in the U.K. on my dad's side of the family. My grandfather's brother moved to the U.K. from Jamaica. It's a pretty big family I'll have there.
- Shawn Porter is a good fighter, but he hasn't accomplished nearly as much as Danny Garcia has accomplished or beat the fighters who he has beat.
- I still have to unify my division and basically become the undefeated welterweight champion of the world. I can't lose. It is more added pressure, but it does make me work harder and keeps me more focused.
- The Dallas rap scene is growing, and hopefully we get to a level like Houston - everybody supporting each other, building each other up to be great.
- My dad and uncles listened to a lot of rap. My dad is a big fan of LL Cool J. Driving in the car with him, we'd listen to Jay-Z and Nas. My sister listened to a lot of No Limit, so I listened to Master P. and Cash Money - Lil Wayne and Juvenile. They had jewelry and nice cars. I was drawn to them.
- I want to stay active and busy. I don't just want to fight a no-name opponent. I want a decent name or a big name or a world champion, somebody who is going to challenge me. That's just it.
