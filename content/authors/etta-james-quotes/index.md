- The only time that I am really truly happy - when I feel at my best - is when I'm on the stage.
- You can't fake this music. You might be a great singer or a great musician but, in the need, that's got nothing to do with it. It's how you connect to the songs and to the history behind them.

- I figured I could do 'It's A Man's Man's Man's World', because I believe it's the truth.
- Johnny Guitar... just one of my favorite singers of all time. I met him when we were both on the road with Johnny Otis in the '50s when I was a teenager. We traveled the country in a car together. I would hear him sing every night.
