- I don't think any evil character thinks that they are evil - they think they have insight that people don't.
- I have an obsession with ketchup! I have it with everything.
- I am interested in complex characters who are difficult and have numerous sides. But I would love to do a comedy role - something maybe 'Monty Python'-esque.
- The only way you learn is by doing. You learn through deed, so that's kind of my aspiration for the time being.
- I am a strange creature. I want to challenge myself and keep people guessing with the roles I take.
- The first thing I said if I sat on the Iron Throne would probably be, 'Ouch!' It's actually painful because it's made of swords. But my first Royal Edict would be, 'Somebody get rid of this damn chair!'
- I've always been fond of my heritage, particularly my Irish heritage. But I'm also from all over the world.
- I am obsessed with the idea of transformation. I have been very lucky so far to play very different roles - and I would love for that to continue.
- I'd be lying to you if I said at 8 I went up to my parents and said, 'Listen, I'm going to become an actor.' That was not the case.
- I am very keen to take on a 'West End' show soon, as I haven't done much theatre, and that would be amazing. It is quite liberating to be on stage night after night.
- The smells are very strong on 'Game of Thrones': the incense, the fire, the heat of all the burns. The smell of Lancel's Faith Militant cloth is very thick in my nostrils right now. And I think the warmth of it all: the hard work ethics, the ambiance, the temperature of the set. There are so many sensory memories of it, which will never leave me.
