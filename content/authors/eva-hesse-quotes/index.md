- Color is whatever comes out of the material and keeps it what it is.
- Maybe if I really believe in me, trust me without any calculated plan, who knows what will happen?
- If I'm O.K., I will abandon restrictions and curbs imposed on myself. Not physical ones, but those restrictive tabs on my inner being, on solely myself. I will strip me of superficial dishonesties. I will paint against every rule I or others have invisibly placed.
- Life doesn't last; art doesn't last. It doesn't matter.
- There's not been one normal thing in my life.
- I am not sure what my stand on lasting really is.
- Mushy novels, pretty pictures, pretty sculpture, decorations on the wall, nice parallel lines - make me sick.
- Don't ask what it means or what it refers to. Don't ask what the work is. Rather, see what the work does.
- Artists don't think archivally.
- Art and life are inseparable.
- Everything for me has always been opposites; nothing has ever been in the middle... My life never had anything normal or in the center.
- I am ultimately convinced that people must first be told that so and so is great ,and then, after a period of given time, they come to believe it for themselves.
- I have the most openness about my art... It's total freedom and willingness to work. I'm willing really to walk on the edge, and if I haven't achieved it, that's where I want to go. But in my life - maybe because my life has been so traumatic, so absurd - there hasn't been one normal, happy thing.
- I should like to achieve free, spontaneous painting delineating a powerful, strong structured image. One must be possible with the other. A difficult problem in itself, but one which I shall achieve.
- Art is the easiest thing in my life, and that's ironic. It doesn't mean I've worked little on it, but it's the only thing I never had to... I have no fear. I could take risks.
