- On Hillary Clinton's side, she believes she's unaccountable to the American people. She favors these old ideas about government, these - these centralized, top down solutions from Washington that keep insiders in the know and give them influence, but regular Americans have no voice.
- We need to get serious about defeating ISIS; we just aren't serious about it yet. I would be very serious about getting it done. I know how to do it. We need to take the fight to them on the battlefield in a more serious way.
- I do believe that power needs to be returned to the states. I think that we've got way too much power in Washington. This is where I'm focused: way too much power in Washington.
- Let me just say that I'm the only candidate in this race now that has any firsthand experience fighting terrorism. And both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, I think, have proven in different ways that they're unprepared for that challenge.
- Donald Trump appeals to the worst fears of Americans at a time we need unity, not division. Republicans are deeply divided by a man who is perilously close to gaining the most powerful position in the world, and many rightly see him as a real threat to our Republic.
- My church, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, puts Jesus Christ at the focal point. It's the focus of everything. What I really hope is that people of faith in this country can come together in this election to ensure we elect a president who's going to do what's required to protect this basic principle of our country.
- I am unknown because I've avoided the limelight so that I could serve. In the case of Donald Trump, he has avoided service so that he could seek the limelight.
- Trump has never sacrificed anything for this country, and in fact, he has attacked people who have. It just makes me sick to my stomach when I see him attacking the mother of a fallen hero or John McCain. It just makes me sick to my stomach that this guy thinks he's prepared to be commander-in-chief.
- On the matter - on the issue of life, it's life. So I actually would pursue appointment, court appointments that would overturn Roe v. Wade.
- Hillary Clinton is a corrupt career politician who has recklessly handled classified information in an attempt to avoid accountability and put American lives at risk, including those of my former colleagues. She fails the basic tests of judgment and ethics any candidate for president must meet.
- If neither Hillary Clinton nor Donald Trump nor I are able to win 270 in the electoral college... then it will go the House of Representatives.
- Donald Trump is already losing badly to Hillary Clinton. He is a weak candidate, and he's performing that way.
- Donald Trump is defeating himself. He is ensuring that Hillary Clinton is elected. I think they would both be absolutely terrible.
- There are lots of different ideas, lots of different opinions about the First Amendment Defense Act and what it should be. There were a lot of different forms of it while I was on the Hill. But I would say that I agree that the decision on gay marriage does mean that we need to take some steps to defend religious liberty.
- As far as a wall is concerned, the experts actually say that in some places a wall is necessary, in other places a double wall is necessary, and in other places that a wall wouldn't help. So I'm for whatever it takes to secure our border with Mexico. We've got to do it. I'm for then enforcing our laws.
- I'm for whatever it takes to secure our border with Mexico.
- I was a case officer, otherwise known as an operations officer. My role was to go out and convince Al Qaeda operatives to instead work with us as well as to convince people and officials in foreign governments to work on behalf of the U.S. government secretly.
- I think the U.S. leaders should do more to support our Israeli allies and the Palestinians to find peace.
- It's never too late to do the right thing, and America deserves much better than either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton can offer us. I humbly offer myself as a leader who can give millions of disaffected Americans a conservative choice for president.
- I think Utahns - and I won't speak for all Utahns - but my sense is that they have real issues with Donald Trump's lack of decency, with his bigotry, the way he's divided this country. That's not the Utahn way. I think they have issues with his attacks on religious minorities.
- Obviously, having served in wars myself, I'm eager to do everything possible to avoid them, but our military capability vis-a-vis a country like Iran is a major source of leverage in any negotiation that we should never, ever give up.
- The idea that Donald Trump is a conservative is a complete farce. He is a conman who pretends to be a conservative.
- If there is anyone who should not be trusted with regard to intelligence, it is Donald Trump, both in the literal sense and with regard to our intelligence services. He shouldn't have access to these briefings.
- I will never turn down a good plate of hummus or falafel or shawarma. I just never will. You know, what I really loved in Israel was that at the time, at least, I could buy so many fruits and vegetables there for very inexpensive prices.
- Donald Trump, despite his campaign promises, this is not a guy who is going to be willing to send executive power that belongs to the legislative branch back to the legislative branch. I mean, Donald Trump is going to try to amass and consolidate power, given that he's an authoritarian.
- I am an originalist, to begin with. So, I am a constitutional conservative. I believe that the Constitution enshrines some universal ideals that make our country strong and that are consistent with truth, and so that's the basic thing.
- I spent over ten years in the Central Intelligence Agency as an undercover operations officer serving overseas after 9/11 where I carried out covert operations against al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups, as well as other countries who are 'hostile to liberty,' as I like to say.
- As far as Gary Johnson is concerned, he is not a credible person on foreign policy. We need somebody like that. He doesn't understand religious liberty. I have some other concerns about his suitability and reliability in, you know, for the presidency. I just don't think he's a credible option.
- I'm a gun owner and strong supporter of the Second Amendment.
- Trump is not going to win the presidency because he himself is a weak, weak candidate.
- Democracies don't fight each other. Terrorists don't tend to come from places where they feel like they have recourse in a political system.
- We know that we can defeat Islamist terrorism without violating our ideals; indeed, we must. These ideals, these American ideals.
- I spent over 10 years in the Central Intelligence Agency, serving overseas, serving in the Middle East. And let me tell you, if you're a terrorist and you want to come to the United States, the worst possible way to do it is as a refugee. You'll go through a year and a half to two years of vetting.
- I believe Donald Trump is a bona fide authoritarian. I am deeply concerned that if he were president of the United States, he would act accordingly.
- As a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I believe in traditional marriage between a man and a woman, but I respect the decision of the Court, and I think it's time to move on.
- Donald Trump himself has financial ties to oligarchs in Russia who are close to Putin.
