- I came to acting as a sort of fluke. I really enjoy it, but I think I'm different from the people who dreamed about it.
- I listen a lot. I think people have their own answers, and if you just listen to someone and agree with them, eventually they'll work it out for themselves.
- I never wanted to do reunion shows for the sake of a reunion show. I've done all the 'Brady Bunch' stuff except for the Variety Show, but when a talk show wants us all to get together for their sake, it's not interesting to me.
- When I was six years old, a children's agent moved in next door to us, sent me out on a commercial audition, and I got the job.
- People always brand me as this person who is anti-Brady, and I don't think that I ever have been, except that occasionally I would like to talk about something else that I'm doing.
- I have a unique history. There's no way to ever separate what your life would have been like if you had taken a different path. You have to embrace what is yours, and if you don't like it, you have to decide to change it.
- I don't consider my life to be boring at all. I consider my life to be massively fortunate.
- In the early days of picture-taking, the exposure shutter had to stay open for a long time, so you had to stay really still.
