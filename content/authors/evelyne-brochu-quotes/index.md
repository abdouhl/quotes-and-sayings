- It's very joyful to be in a productive, creative mood, but I find a lot of joy in learning and being told stories.
- Once, I was going to a film event, and someone told me not to wear high heels to it. They said that it might intimidate the men. For some reason, I was ready to take their cue, but about an hour later, something in my head started ringing, and I thought, 'That is the worst advice anybody's ever given me.'
- I feel the less you project of yourself, the more you can be believable as a character. I also think it's just better for your own mental health. Then you can be a human being and change your mind, and nobody asks you questions about it!
- I really think truth comes from the body. When you're running for your life, you breathe differently; you talk differently.
- I think, at some point, there's only so much you can draw from within without getting inspired from what's around you and what other people are doing.
- My criteria is always, 'Would I go see this movie? Is this character something I've never done? Who is the director? Do they inspire me?'
- Sometimes, in the summer, I just step out of my home, and I see all these people - Montreal is like El Dorado. It doesn't exist. It's so perfect and beautiful and multicultural and chill and fun.
- I'm not a huge spender. Sometimes when you pay a lot, you're paying for the company's advertising. It feels ridiculous to pay for a name.
- Human beings are created with empathy. Art serves that purpose. So why should I be disinterested in a character who's a man, and why should a man shy away from a show that's female-driven?
- I've been travelling a lot, and so I believe in not owning so much.
- I don't like shopping that much. I do it for an hour, and then I feel empty inside and weird.
