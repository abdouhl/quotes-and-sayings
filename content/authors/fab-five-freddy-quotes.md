- Although I grew up as a fan of the culture from the disco D.J. era as a young kid and hearing the beginnings of hip-hop, I'm hearing it all from another borough in Brooklyn.
- People actually perceived me with being this cat from the Bronx because I'm one of a handful of folks that was actually acting in 'Wild Style'.
- I was bringing the whole music, hip-hop, art, break dancing and urban cultural thing to the downtown table.
- I want to plug back into the hip-hop audience. Whether it be fans who grew up watching 'Yo!', or people who have become familiar with the culture via the Internet.
- I'm just very pleased and thankful that there was a receptive audience of people that I was able to connect with.
