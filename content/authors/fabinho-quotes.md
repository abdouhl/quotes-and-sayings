- Guardiola, Zidane, who's doing a great work, Tite, also doing a great job in the national team, Simeone. These are managers I would like to work with some day.
- I can play wherever the manager wants.
- It's good to have someone who speaks your language in everyday life, especially for me, who does not speak English so well.
- I've been fortunate enough to win titles; I've been unfortunate enough to get relegated as well.

- I've got a good understanding with Tiemoue Bakayoko.
- There's no doubt about it: I think that my versatility helps me.

- Being in midfield, in general, you don't have a lot of time to think, and in the Premier League, that's even less of the case. You just don't have time to think.
- The Premier League, if not the best league in the world, is among the two best. It has a much higher visibility than Ligue 1 in France.
- I had the good luck to have the experience of training with fantastic football players like Cristiano Ronaldo, Ozil, Modric, and I also played for Real Madrid B. That was a fantastic experience because it was my first international experience as a football player and taught me a lot as a football player.

- I have adapted well in Liverpool.
- If the fans are liking what I've been doing, and they want to create a song for me, let's get on with it!

- My process to adapt to English football has been very good.

- When I went to Real Madrid, I was only 18 or 19 years old. It was my first year as a professional footballer. I was very young.
- Playing for Liverpool, I know what the relationship between the fans and the club is like. With every player, you can see the desire to win, the desire to show that Liverpool are the best and deserve to win the league.
- I'm happy at Liverpool. There's no reason for me to leave.
- I haven't played a lot as a centre-back, but in those games, I feel like I did well.
