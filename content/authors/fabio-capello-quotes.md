- I have always been in love with football. As a child, I started playing football.
- To train a national team, you have to know what team you have at your disposal and what this team is capable of. You need to get the best out of them and take them as far as possible. Yet, sometimes, you can't achieve your goals.
- Being at a World Cup is a sacrifice? Twenty days is a sacrifice? What about the people there working for the team, up at five every morning? That's sacrifice. It's not a sacrifice to play.
- Having the team with leaders - John Terry is one, Gareth Barry is a leader - is very, very important. These players helped me a lot.
- Here the football is more physically strong. The Spanish are more technical. In Italy more tactical. In England... you have to run. We don't fear the tackles, because the people like this.
- When I am at work, there is no need for me to deliver anything but results.
- In Italy, it is all about tactics and playing for a result, whereas in Spain, the focus is on technique and pace. In England, the game is based on aggression and non-stop action.
- At home we never mention football. Not with my wife, not with my sons, not with my mother. Sometimes they will see something in the paper and ask me what I think. But I say, nothing.
- I will never close the door to the national team on anyone, but you also have to remember that in modern football, only players who are in peak physical condition can make the most of their technical abilities.
- Hotels make me sad. I need a home.
- Every national side plays according to their characteristics and the kind of entertainment they like.
- The first World Cup I followed was Sweden 1958. I watched the games on TV. Brazil won that World Cup by defeating Sweden 5-2 in the Final and Pele scored twice.
- Look, in my life, I played one World Cup: the greatest thing. I used to wait in anticipation for the squad announcement. I didn't go to Argentina 78 having played throughout qualification. Now, that hurt.
- I am not interested in the Italian national team. I prefer to have a new experience, outside of Italy.
- When a man crosses his legs and the trouser leg rides up to show the hairy shins, it offends my eyes.
- Goalscoring depends on how relaxed you are in front of goal.
- The challenge of coaching a national side like England would be something different. The job is not about coaching every day.
- I never had any problems with the players. I would say that my English is better than Gary Lineker's Spanish.
- I like classy women: Virna Lisi, Catherine Deneuve.
- I always play to win, as I proved at AC Milan, Real Madrid, Roma and Juventus. I want my players to have the same ambition.
- The goalkeeper is very, very important, as much as a striker. Anyone who wants to win a title has to have a goalkeeper.
- A team needs leaders to drive it forward, but you never know how it will end.
- I only ever call up the best players, or at least the players who are the most suited to the way I wish to play.
- My English might not be good enough to talk politics but there is no difficulty if we are talking about football.
