- When I meet parents in my children's school, they say there aren't good films for kids to watch. I wonder about the lack of such films too. What do my kids watch?

- People tend to take themselves too seriously.
- We have music playing at home, day and night.

- I always say that cinema reflects life, not the other way round.
- Every person on Twitter is a critic. Every person who watches a movie will write a blog or a review. You can't go out trying to impress these people.

- I always wanted to make cinema which will entertain the masses, cinema that could be called escapist but is mounted on a realistic scale with high production values.
- Luckily, filmmaking is not a nine-to-five job.

- In 'Shirin Farhad' I play the character of a Parsi woman. Though I was born a Parsi, in a Parsi family, I don't have the right accent.
- I see people every day who think they're the be all and end all of the industry. I've seen so many people come and go, but the industry doesn't revolve around one person.
- When TV came, people said who will go to theatres to watch movies? When the Internet came, they said the same. And now it's the digital media... The doomsday predictions are always there but I don't think people will stop going to cinema halls because that is one experience you can't get at home.
- Manmohan Desai's films pack a lot of joy and have a child-like quality and you can see the director is having fun, but my movies don't suspend disbelief that much. But it's good to be compared to Manmohan Desai. He was run down by critics in his time.

- I feel 95 per cent of Indian boys are mama's boys and a few of them couldn't come out of their mother's shadows. Salman Khan is one of them. I feel one of the reasons he is unable to find a soul mate is he looks for his mother in every girl.
- I don't smoke, drink, do drugs or even have affairs. If I don't even swear, I should be put in a shrine and sanctified.
- There are two aspects around which the dynamics of Bollywood revolve - chivalry and chauvinism.
- In 'Purab Aur Paschim,' there's one of the nicer patriotic scenes which is patriotic without going jingoistic. There's a scene set in a rotating restaurant, where Pran, who has left India, is completely running India down and Manoj Kumar is taking up for India. And there's that song 'Jab Zero Diya.'
- I make commercial films only. I don't make small, boring films.
- You are punished only when you are not performing as per expectation, and not because you belong to a particular religion, caste, or creed. Here, you fail because your vision is not right or you have not worked hard. That's why I believe we have true democracy in the film industry. How I wish the rest of the country was like the industry!
- I would love to make a sarcastic film; I am so sarcastic that even my kids are now getting used to my sarcasm. You see it a lot in British comedy because that's their sense of humour.
- The climax of 'Johny Mera Naa,' it's one of the best climaxes ever written, ever directed. If I ever wanted to remake a movie, I'd try to do this one, just for the climax.
- For me feminism is equality.
- I always say that I'm a filmmaker, not a factory. I don't have to churn out films every six months.
- A part of 'Happy New Year' is inspired by western pop culture, the pop music videos of Michael Jackson, Madonna and Duran Duran in the '80s.
- God bless IVF because it's never too late to conceive any more. However, having said that, I have to point out that going through IVF is a gruelling procedure; maybe that's why only a woman can go through it!
- Somewhere my dad gave up. He was really so successful at his level that after a point he could not handle failure.
- When I am making a movie, I am very casual; wearing chappals, and have my hair tied. However, when I am judging a show, I take care of myself and get the makeup and hair done.

- It takes two years to make a good film.
- I think it is important to enjoy your work.

- Professionally, I like doing one thing at a time and enjoy directing the most.
- I never thought 'Mein Hoon Na' will do so well in Pakistan. Whenever I meet Pakistanis in London or the U.S., they have so much love and affection for me because of 'Mein Hoon Na,' which was my most criticised film in India.
- I'm not promiscuous by nature.
- I've always been told that because of 'Main Hoon Na,' a lot of female filmmakers have come up but I maintain that direction is a 'genderless' job.

- Whenever I visit abroad, people recognise me - it feels great.
- The most creative director I have worked with is Mani Ratnam.
- I always feel your movie will be as strong as your weakest link.
