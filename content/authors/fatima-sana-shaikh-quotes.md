- I had given up on acting because I would go for auditions every day, but nothing would happen.
- When such acting powerhouses take note of your work and express their appreciation, it is an overwhelming feeling. I could not believe it when Rishi ji tweeted. Then Amitji and Rekha ma'am sent handwritten letters, which I have read more than fifty times. 'Dangal' is a very special film for me, and these are my lifetime treasure.
- At one point, I had lost my confidence as an actor, and working again was tough. I started stammering due to lack of confidence. It took time, but things became better.
- I was very young during 'Chachi 420' and don't remember much now.
- After so many years of rejection, I felt acting would have to become a hobby rather than a full-time profession.
- I found it more challenging to act in a small scene, especially if it has no dialogue and if it is a close-up with only expressions.
- I tried my hand at photography and worked with a studio for six months.
- I was about to give up acting when I got the call about being short-listed for 'Dangal.'
- I thought of learning cinematography, so I assisted a cinematographer for an ad.
- Although I started off as a child artist, I left acting in between, as I felt that I was missing the fun of school days. But a little later, I became keen on acting again and started going for auditions.
- I auditioned 5-6 times for 'Dangal.' I was just waiting for the final call, as there were about 15-16 girls who auditioned for the role.
- Kids and adults are treated differently on sets. Being a kid, you can get away with anything, and it looks cute. But as an adult, it's a whole new journey.
- I was not getting work, even after auditioning for films. So I started working in a studio as a photographer; I assisted a cinematographer for two ads. I was thinking that I will get into photography or cinematography or assist someone. But then the 'Dangal' offer came, and I was busy with the auditions.
- When I was growing up, I thought I was getting bored of acting, so I left that. Then after a few years, I started missing it. I left my studies mid-way, and I used to give lots of auditions.
- When I was a kid, I didn't know how I got into acting.
- When you are doing a long scene, you have dialogue and interaction to narrate the character. But making sense out of facial expression and reacting is difficult. Having said that, I think such challenges are good for learning.
- I have always been a movie buff and had no interest in any games and sports. I do not even watch cricket, which is one of the favourite games of most of my friends. However, I have become a wrestling fan after 'Dangal.'
- I faced many ups and downs, like any other actor: not getting through auditions or even worse - getting shortlisted and not being selected. Most actors go through the process.
- Shah Rukh Khan is the love of my life. I love Aamir Khan also.
- I started auditioning but at times would feel depressed, as I would get shortlisted but never received the final call. Only when the commercials were released would I come to know that I was not selected.
