- I don't believe in total freedom for the artist. Left on his own, free to do anything he likes, the artist ends up doing nothing at all. If there's one thing that's dangerous for an artist, it's precisely this question of total freedom, waiting for inspiration and the rest of it.
- Hype is the awkward and desperate attempt to convince journalists that what you've made is worth the misery of having to review it.

- I always direct the same film. I cannot distinguish one from the other.
- If you see with innocent eyes, everything is divine.
- Through the ages, from the beginning of time, I'm certain man has covered woman's face with masks. They are, however, his masks, not hers.
- There is no end. There is no beginning. There is only the passion of life.
- A good opening and a good ending make for a good film provide they come close together.
- A different language is a different vision of life.
- Censorship is advertising paid by the government.
- Money is everywhere but so is poetry. What we lack are the poets.
- I'd like very much to make a confident picture. I would like to be as good as nature, which, with a shower, produces flowers and grass to cover the destruction. But we are surrounded by human fragmentation, by pessimism, and it is difficult to talk of other things.
- It is only when I am doing my work that I feel truly alive.
- My work has always been the thing that justifies my life.
- A created thing is never invented and it is never true: it is always and ever itself.
- You exist only in what you do.
- When I start a picture, I always have a script, but I change it every day. I put in what occurs to me that day out of my imagination. You start on a voyage; you know where you will end up but not what will occur along the way. You want to be surprised.
- Fate is written in the face.
- All artists are equal when they are themselves.
- My relationship with my body has changed. I used to consider it as a servant who should obey, function, give pleasure. In sickness, you realise that you are not the boss. It is the other way around.
- Nietzsche claimed that his genius was in his nostrils and I think that is a very excellent place for it to be.
- I make pictures to tell a story, to tell lies, and to amuse.
- In 'Roma,' I wanted to get across the idea that underneath Rome today is ancient Rome. So close. I am always conscious of that, and it thrills me. Imagine being in a traffic jam at the Coliseum! Rome is the most wonderful movie set in the world... As was the case with many of my film ideas, it was inspired by a dream.
- If you do what you were born to do, I think you will never grow old.
- It's easier to be faithful to a restaurant than it is to a woman.
- Experience is what you get while looking for something else.
- The artist is the medium between his fantasies and the rest of the world.
- Talking about dreams is like talking about movies, since the cinema uses the language of dreams; years can pass in a second, and you can hop from one place to another. It's a language made of image. And in the real cinema, every object and every light means something, as in a dream.
- No critic writing about a film could say more than the film itself, although they do their best to make us think the oppposite.
- I think television has betrayed the meaning of democratic speech, adding visual chaos to the confusion of voices. What role does silence have in all this noise?
- To people of my generation, the picture show was really another dimension - sensual, whimsical. No uniforms or collective rites, but a place where little boys like me could laugh and feel free.
- The public has lost the habit of movie-going because the cinema no longer possesses the charm, the hypnotic charisma, the authority it once commanded. The image it once held for us all - that of a dream we dreamt with our eyes open - has disappeared.
- All art is autobiographical. The pearl is the oyster's autobiography.
- Realism is a bad word. In a sense everything is realistic. I see no line between the imaginary and the real.
- I do not need a producer. I need only a good production manager. I need only a man who will give me money.
- I am not the kind of director who sits in a chair smoking a cigar talking with a microphone to 10 assistants. I need to move. To touch. To put a painting on a wall. To arrange a set.
- I did not realise that I was so loved. It can't just be for the films. I must have done something else, but I can't remember what.
- Even if I set out to make a film about a fillet of sole, it would be about me.
