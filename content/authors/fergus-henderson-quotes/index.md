- We live in a flat; my wife would be happy if we had a house with stairs. Or a little cottage in the country.
- Porridge and the urban lifestyle don't mix well.
- What worries me is that, because of the amount of media coverage of food, Britain seems to have become a foodie nation - but I'm not sure it actually has. I'm not sure there's been a huge change in the pantry at home or what we cook for supper.
- Ambition drives you on, ability certainly helps, but the fickle finger of fate and luck are great things.
- I'm a big believer that we get the politicians we deserve.
- Nose-to-tail eating is not a bloodlust, testosterone-fueled offal hunt. It's common sense, and it's all good stuff.
- I had a holiday job in a kitchen, but I think we'll draw a polite veil over that. There was nothing joyous or creative about it. And none of this helped my studies.
- I've probably got lots of heroes. One is a chap called Charles Campbell - he is a wonderful chap. We cooked together in a nightclub in Notting Hill. He told me brilliant stories of food and life and generally put me on the right track.
- A pig's trotter is a fantastic thing. The first night of my honeymoon in Paris, my wife fell asleep in her steak tartare, so my trotter kept me company.
- My first proper kitchen was this funny little club that we set up in Mercer Street in Covent Garden. It got shut down. Then I worked at a club in Notting Hill.
- I cook British food, but it doesn't mean I'm jingoistic about it. People can cook very good fusion food.
- I think Isambard Kingdom Brunel would be a good chap to have supper with. Anyone who builds a railway and then builds a steamship when he gets to Bristol and can't go any further must be a good chap.
- Do not let the word 'tripe' deter you. Let its soothing charms win you over, and enjoy it as do those who always have!
- I think tripe is maligned. It's wonderful stuff, but everyone goes 'urgh.' You have to wash and then cook it, very gently braise it, for eight hours. It uplifts you but steadies you at the same time.
- I feel good when I stir something with a spurtle, but I don't make porridge very much in London.
- I'm like a kid in a sweet shop every day. It's slightly cringey how much fun I have.
