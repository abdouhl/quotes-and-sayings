- McLaren was a risky project because they were completely new, but we are one team - we win and we lose together.
- I miss winning. I miss being on the podium.
- When I joined F1, I was 19 years old, full of energy.
- I am one of the best to have raced in F1. I am probably not fastest in qualifying, or the wet, but I am 9.5 in all areas. I try to benefit from that.
- I always had that, even when I was a kid in a go-kart or when I was playing soccer or tennis: that need of winning. It was there all my life, and it's still there now.
- With Ferrari sometimes, you win or you lose depending on what the mood of the team in general, of the group in general.
- I am very proud to be part of this team, and I know that winning with Ferrari will mean more than winning with another team.
- Creating a top team and being in a position to win the Tour de France will give me a nice feeling. But I know it is not easy to create a top team from zero. You need good riders, good staff, a lot of preparation and, most important, a lot of sponsors.
- My parents are very similar to me.
- For me it's a simple sport and a simple way to live these seven or eight years of maximum sport.
- I feel extremely lucky and privileged to have my achievements.
- My idea is to win all the iconic motor sport races in the world.
- Every day, every year, every new season is a reset from the last, and you are still hungry for success, to do things better and better.
- If you challenge yourself and try to be the best in all areas, you have to be a complete driver.
- I would not be happy if I had many trophies at home and people think I don't deserve them.
- It is true - maybe with five or seven points more, I could be five times world champion. But on the other hand, I could have zero world championships, and zero wins or zero podiums, because F1 is an extremely competitive environment. So I just take the positives, and I am happy with my achievements.
- The day that arrives the first victory or the first win for McLaren-Honda will be a massive achievement for all of us.
- It is difficult to take in how long you have been doing one thing when you compete at the highest level and always with the highest intensity.
- To be one of the names being talked about is better than not. But it's only talking.
- In life, it's winning - when I go to the supermarket, and I go with a friend, I try to get through the door first. Things like that - everything in life is a competition for me.
- After five years in Ferrari, being second all the time, I think it was enough for me.
- The Triple Crown is an attractive target because it is so difficult to achieve.
- For me, it was not destiny to make it to where I am now - I thought for a long- time I would become a go-kart mechanic, or a job like this, not an F1 driver.
- When I race in Australia or Korea or Japan, I know it will be a big change for me because Ferrari fans are worldwide. It's very nice if you win, but it's not so good if you lose. All this is part of being a Ferrari driver.
- You can play basketball and have a magic night and score 40 points with your team-mates and win the game. There are favourites for the World Cup, but you can't guarantee Germany, Spain, or Brazil will win, but here, everyone can guarantee that Mercedes or Ferrari will win the race, and this is very sad for the sport.
- I like America, and I think probably the American people like me.
- Even if you have a difficult season, you still believe the following year will be better and a good one.

- Ferrari gives you a special feeling.
- I don't want to just be a good driver: I want to be a complete driver and hopefully the best driver in the world.
- I'm just hungry to win.
- In Spain there were no TV rights for Formula One.
- I have always been very calm on the outside. I'm not too stressed now just because I'm in formula one. For me, tomorrow will be another day whether I finish first or last. I have to do the maximum and I cannot ask any more from myself.
- I am very proud of what we have built in Spain, because it is not a traditional Formula 1 country. I think we have found passionate fans, and built up a strong culture for the sport - and things are improving every day, with more and more people getting interested.
- When I take go-karts out with my friends, it's a disaster normally. But in the race car, I'm calm because they pay me to do this, and I have to be professional.
- I want to live a normal life that I never had the opportunity to do for many years.
- If you're in the best team in the world, you or your teammate have to win.
- When I race in Australia or Korea or Japan I know it will be a big change for me because Ferrari fans are worldwide.
- I adapt my driving style more or less to anything, from go-kart to motorbike to wet, more downforce, less downforce, Pirelli, Bridgestone, Michelin, V8, V6, whatever.
- I like to race, not to do laps alone.
- I look at myself as someone who has been very lucky - my job is also what I enjoy most in the world, and I can make my life doing it.
