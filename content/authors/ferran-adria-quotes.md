- Friends are really important, especially when you've had the successes that I've had. I've gone really far in my career, so they're the ones that keep you humble, keep your feet on the ground.

- Risk is to do something that 99 percent of the time would be a failure.

And if children have a connection with, and are involved in the preparation of, the food they eat, then it will be normal for them to cook these kind of meals, and they will go on cooking them for the rest of their lives.
- We never have business meals at El Bulli. If it's about business, you're probably not paying much attention to the food.
- Just to eat is a gift.
- Chefs have only been able to work in restaurants, high-end cuisine. Why? Why haven't they been able to find other scenarios? For those chefs who want to do avant-garde cuisine, should they be finding their income in a restaurant?
- Ferran Adria making hamburgers... some thought it was crazy. But getting them perfect was a challenge. Plus I'm fascinated by all aspects of food.
- I don't dream at night; life has given me the stuff I need to be able to dream during the day. I'm very lucky.
- It's very hard to be an innovator at the highest level in any discipline. For some chefs it's merely about combining ingredients, but that's something you can do with your eyes closed.
- Everywhere the sky is blue. There are a multitude of cuisines and dishes. I think of them as the languages and dialects of food.
- I have a driver's licence, but the truth is that I hardly ever drive. I prefer to get around by taxi.
- I never even dreamed of being a chef, and that's fundamental.
- For me to go to a restaurant and eat something that is not only good, but totally new, is a double thrill. Double the enjoyment.
- When you talk about avant-garde cuisine, the surprise factor is really important. For example, I love looking at blogs and the photos, but I'm not that keen on other people taking photos of my dishes.
- In a city, it's very hard to do a restaurant, an avant-garde-cuisine restaurant, where each year you need to change the whole menu.
- I don't worry about the things I can't change.
- I believe that if you eat well, you work even better.

- I am not a multimillionaire. I don't own a yacht or a Ferrari. I live in a 60-square- metre flat. My needs are simple.
- I had a very normal childhood, and my mother cooked very normal food.
- I don't read books regularly, because I'm always writing them. I've written 30 books, thousands of pages.
- I was 18 when I first started working at a restaurant. I was a dishwasher. I only got the job because I wanted to go to Ibiza for vacation, and washing dishes was the only job I could find.
- Innovation, being avant garde, is always polemic.
- I wanted to take nouvelle cuisine further, to the point where we were breaking down the essence of taste and sensation, reconfiguring food as a series of really intense hits on the tongue.
- Why not mix this and that? If soy goes well with fish, how come no one does beef carpaccio with soy? Why do we have such a taste and not another? It's all about culture. There is something, however, that I really don't like: bell peppers.
