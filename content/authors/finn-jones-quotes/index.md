- I worked on 'Game Of Thrones' for six years, so I'm very well equipped to handle hype surrounding television shows.
- I know feeling pressure gets you nowhere creatively. You've just got to understand the character, understand the story, and just play it to the fullest extent.
- Every day of my life, I make an effort. Like, everything's an effort - a good effort.
- I do feel like the media is one of the biggest problems. If you look at all these rolling news channels, they sensationalize the story, they focus on gossip, and they don't actually tell the full story.
- I respect Marvel as a company, and I think they're great, but never in my life have I looked up to being a superhero.
- A lot of the vibe in London is being sucked dry because of the economic situation. It's very expensive, and it gives you nothing back. New York still feels like there's stuff going on. People are struggling to create art. There's still a vibe.
- I'm a huge advocate for human rights and cultural rights. I stand up for minorities and will always continue to do so.
- I've always been interested in mindfulness and alternative ways of seeing the world.
- I was never a troublemaker, but I also was never a nerdy kid. I was never a cool kid or a sports kid. At lunchtimes, I never fit in with any cliques, so I'd end up just walking around the school by myself, listening to music.
- When I was in drama school, I really got into a dark place. I went to a therapist - it was really helpful to have that dialogue with someone. So I understand anxiety.
- Pretty much everyone on my iPod, I'd like to be friends with. But I'd say that the main two that I'd love to get into a conversation with are Werner Herzog and Graham Hancock.
- I find the comic book audience a lot more intense than the fantasy one, definitely.
- New York has a deep culture of house and dance music, and to be able to tap into that is my way of shutting off. I go to friends' parties and local spots around the area: places I can go to, have a dance, and forget about being an actor and the attention.
- My mum was a child minder, but now she fosters. My dad was in the police force, and now he's a private detective.
- At first, I didn't know what an actor was. I thought it was an acrobat. I saw acrobats at the circus, and I thought that was interesting. In my head, that was what I imagined I wanted to be when I grew up. Then I realized what an actor was, and I've gravitated to it ever since.
- I get that people want more diversity in TV and film, and I stand by that. I stand in solidarity with better diversity in TV shows, especially for Asian actors. I agree with that 100 per cent.
- About a year after leaving drama school or a year and a half - and I was working solidly ever since leaving drama school - I picked up 'Game of Thrones.'
- 'Thrones' would be the perfect platform to send a progressive message because right now, our politicians aren't telling us any truths. It's hard to find a good, meaningful message, so I think it's up to storytellers, television shows, and films to have an impact on the world conversation. Is that not what film and television is for?
- I will say that Marvel is 100 times more secretive than 'Game of Thrones.' Like, they're not even on the same playing field.
- The power should be in individual democracies in individual communities. It shouldn't be an oligarchy or some small group of elite. Power should be with the people and not with some politician or some heir to the throne or some madman.
- There's nothing interesting about seeing our characters for an hour and a half do some flashy flying in the sky and beating up on some buildings. It's boring, and people don't want that anymore. They want character, and they want story.
- Women are the strong people in this world, not men. I think TV is finally catching up with that reality, and thank God.
- I'm not a critic. I'm an actor. I see the role I get given on the page. I try to bring it to life as best as I can.
- I've always been a bit of a lost soul, and I think that goes back to me being adopted and not knowing my roots.
- For me as an actor, I find it's most creative when I'm bringing myself into the role rather than putting the role on. I feel like it's more of a cathartic experience.
- I've had this theory for a while, but I think there needs to be a message with the end of 'Game of Thrones.' You know? I think what needs to happen is ice and fire are going to go to war, a huge war between those two factions, and I think, in that war, they will destroy themselves. There will be complete chaos, complete destruction.
- I'm a big fan of 'Akira,' and I think comics are a great place to tell intelligent, fantastical stories. You can say stuff that you wouldn't be able to in other mediums.
