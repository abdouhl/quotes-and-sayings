- I have a few grey hairs. I dye them. I don't let them show when I'm reading the news.
- No matter how beautiful a spot I find myself in, if the food ain't up to much, I won't enjoy myself.
- I was the first person in my family to go to university so it was quite a big deal for us.
- My parents' set-up was very traditional, whereas that's not the life I've chosen to lead.
- I wasn't born into money, and you never know when that money's going to stop coming in.
- There's not much opportunity to learn to read the news. By and large, you either can or you can't do it pretty much straight away.
- Pudding is my favourite part of any meal and I always have one if I can manage it.
- If you crave a bit of adventure and the unknown, Singapore is not for you.
- I'm not tough. I'm just not a retiring violet when it comes to airing my opinions.
- I wouldn't consider cosmetic surgery.
- I'm all about the story. And the stories I remember tend to be the ones of sorrow, or family history, or revelation of the self.
- You can't beat a good millefeuille, which is basically a posh custard slice. Yum!
- I think of myself as a journalist first and foremost.
- The best thing, on 'Question Time,' is when the reality confronts the rhetoric.
- I haven't done Botox. Although there are a few women on screen who do, and if you don't do it, which I don't, you look pretty rough by comparison.
- I saw 'The Theory of Everything,' which I loved, but I'm afraid I hardly ever get to go to the cinema.
- The BBC is a huge part of the nation's cultural life.
- I don't go into the newsroom and people start salivating. I can't think of anything further from the truth.
- Coming to Rajasthan had been my idea, my dream. In the weeks before we arrived, I had tried and failed on numerous occasions to enthuse my family with the joys of travel in India; reading bits from the guidebooks, telling the children about the history of the Mughals, insisting to my daughter that she really would enjoy curry if it was in India.
- If you work and you want to see your children, something's got to give and for me, it's my social life.
- I've chosen not to go to Sky or ITV because the programmes I've made at the BBC, I want to carry on making.
- There is a thing about women, in particular, being endlessly grateful for the opportunities in life, rather than saying, 'I'm here because I'm good.'
- They're all good-looking men - I can't think of a male presenter who isn't a good-looking bloke - but, you know, they're not judged by their suits and ties.
- If I were to say anything to my 18-year-old self, it would be, 'Loosen up. Chill out.'
- Brexit can tend to be a dialogue of the deaf.
- I remember my dad saying to me, 'But Fiona don't you want to go and do the dramatic society. You can still do your women's groups as well.' And I said, 'Dad, feminism is a way of life! It's not a hobby!'
- When I started in news on the 'Six O'Clock,' I was 36 and felt very inexperienced.
- I was born in Singapore, but I left at four so memories are hazy.
- I learnt a salutary lesson when I was being hired for the 'Six O'Clock News' and others were being fired, people who I thought were great, like Jill Dando. Letting her go was a big mistake, in my view. But that is probably going to be me one day - I'll read about it in the press and that will be that.
- Have I ever presented a programme I don't watch? Well, I've done loads of programmes that no one else watched!
- I'm used to doing a lot of live broadcasting.
- My own valuation moment: When I started 'Antiques Roadshow,' John Benjamin looked at my engagement ring, which is Victorian. I sat there as a visitor would and he dated it, talked me through the stone, which is an opal, and which mine it would have been from.
- I'm quite famously frugal.
- I couldn't imagine life without Radio 4.
- I conquered my phobia of camping, although I doubt I'll be pitching my tent at a muddy festival any time soon.
- This is going to make me sound 100 years old, but I really loved David Cassidy in 'The Partridge Family.'
- Really, I've been at the BBC too long and have spent too much time out on the road to worry about being judged as a clothes horse.
- People are more than two-dimensional, and again I think the complexities in life, and in one's makeup, grow as you get older, partly through experience.
- I had done debate programmes before and quite often you go into them thinking: 'I might need to build some energy in the room.' 'On Question Time,' the reverse is true. A lot of the time, I am just trying to not have it turn into a slanging match.
- Thailand was a revelation to me; the landscapes, the culture, the food and the people.
- I think having a healthy distrust of authority is a good thing, within certain parameters, obviously.
- My Duke of Edinburgh interview for his 90th in June 2011 was not one of my successes. I knew what to expect: there were some very uncomfortable moments and put-downs, but I think it made for entertaining viewing.
- I was at a film premiere that George Clooney was attending and I was very star-struck. We weren't having a long conversation or anything, but I was definitely slightly in awe of him.
- If you're in people's living-rooms, via the television, it's what happens. You're more noticeable. But I'm not aware that anyone has said I pay a lower rate of tax. I don't. I pay my full share of tax, believe you me.
- I collect things called 'samplers' which are Victorian pieces of needlework usually done by children in a workhouse to show that they have a skill which can be used in service, stitching household linen or that kind of thing. I think they're very humble and very beautiful.
- Of course, I'd love to be regarded as a voice of authority.
- I backpacked around Thailand when I was a university student and have wanted to return ever since.
- I'm astonished at the freedom with which a depressingly large number of men feel they can just say what they want and write the most hideously misogynistic stuff about women.
- I really like sitting down with my daughter to watch programmes like 'Call the Midwife,' '24 hours in A&E,' 'One Born Every Minute' and 'Our Girl.' It's just the two of us, which is really nice.
- Don't ask me the secret to a good long-term relationship - I have no idea! Honestly, I think it's just luck.
- When both my parents were unwell I was in that situation that will be very familiar to many women. I had young children in one part of the country, and elderly unwell parents in another. I was in a constant state of guilt. Was I there enough for my mother? Was I there enough for my children?
- In my twenties, I was virulently opposed to anyone commenting on my appearance, lest it come at the expense of my ability.
- Within less than an hour of arriving in Singapore, it was clear we had arrived in a country where eating has been elevated to the status of a national pastime.
- I met someone with a title on my first day, Baronet von Something, and I thought: 'Look at me, I've really grafted. Who are these people who have just waltzed into Oxford? I don't want to hang out with those people. They're nothing like me.'
- I love 'The Master And Margarita' by Mikhail Bulgakov, which is about repression in Soviet Russia in the 1930s.
- Family is the priority. Your job never loves you back, that's the way I look at it.
- I've worked hard, but I've been lucky too.
- With two older brothers, I was a tomboy in one sense, but on the other hand I really loved dolls. My brothers weren't very happy when I nicked their Action Men to play with my dolls and they were appalled when I made them kiss my Barbies.
- I don't particularly like being told what to do.
- The standards by which a woman's appearance is judged on the news are different to men, there's no question about that. Our clothes are different, for starters, they're much more varied, they're commented upon, there's no question about that. But do you have to be really good-looking? I don't think that's true.
- When I started presenting I'd get invited to red carpet events and I went to a few premieres. But pretty soon I thought, 'Life's too short.'
- If I want to watch things I'm on, I end up watching on my own.
- My mum, who died in 2011, was the most loving mother you could ask for. She was very compassionate, always a good listener, and her love was a constant throughout my life. She was very sympathetic, kind and understanding and I think these values can be underrated.
- Antiques Roadshow' was the first job I had taken since my children were born that took me away from them consistently over a period of time. That was a big adjustment for all of us.
- I am a simple soul.
- I don't know anything about antiques. I do buy them now, but I have a little knowledge, and great enthusiasm.
- You don't present a show like 'Crimewatch' without developing a real respect for the justice system in this country.
- Outside certain parameters, I don't consider myself that serious a person.
- After 'Question Time,' I find my mind is racing. So I try to watch something that's a million miles away from all that, like 'Poldark' or 'Call the Midwife' or 'Derry Girls.'
- There are a million and one things I'd love to get stuck into. Travel, finally getting to spend some time with the family. And I'd love to become a magistrate.
- I'm all for a passionate debate, and sometimes things can be heated, which is fine, up to a point. As long as we remember that we are human beings.
- As an army marches on its stomach, I vacation on mine. And for that reason, among others, I found myself in holiday heaven in Singapore.
- My father John taught me about hard work and the importance of manners.
- On 'Question Time,' I've noticed great anger from the audience. When we discuss Brexit, emotions range from white-hot fury to cold, grey apathy. As soon as we move off Brexit, debate is much more nuanced and considered.
- I'm always disappointed by women who say they prefer working with men. What is that all about? I love working with women, I love the company of women.
- I'm very fortunate in the things I've done and I've worked really hard at them. It's always ultimately up to the viewers whether they like it or not.
- The audience is an absolutely critical part of 'Question Time' and selecting that audience is a big and very important job every week. What we need to do every week without fail is make the audience politically representative of the picture across the nation.
- I think the BBC has come a long way in equal pay. I think it's come the furthest of all in the representation of women on screen.
- I talk about feminism being a spectrum.
- I still remember watching 'Antiques Roadshow' as a child with my parents, on a Sunday night, sitting in our 1970s living room.
- Question Time' had been on my fantasy bucket list for some time. Of all the jobs in broadcasting that's the job I knew I wanted to do.
- Muscat itself is a mixture of impersonal modern buildings, shopping malls, mosques, traditional souks, tarmac and sand.
- Most visitors to Iceland tend to spend just a few hours in Reykjavik before moving on to the geological wonders beyond. I think they are missing out.
- My father was MD of Unilever, so we followed him around the world.
- I love 'Chicago,' I love the musical and the movie and I thought Catherine Zeta-Jones was amazing.
- The one good thing about jet lag when you fly to the United States is that you wake up so madly early, you can beat everyone else to the big tourist attractions and miss the queues.
- My kids once said, 'What would you do if you hadn't got us?' I replied, 'I'd be more successful and I'd have more friends, but I wouldn't be as happy.'
- Well, not everyone wants to lead the kind of life I lead.
- I've been on camels before, lumbering slowly through the desert - not hugely exciting, but I enjoyed the 'Lawrence of Arabia' vibe.
- The thing is, if you come on the 'Roadshow' we are not going to humiliate you. The thing about the 'Antiques Roadshow' is not to humiliate people.
- Think Oman, and you think desert. But what we found was mile after mile of barren, spiky rubble, cliffs of jutting sharp rocks, unrelieved by a single piece of vegetation or water. We drove for hours across what felt like the surface of the moon. We saw goats foraging but couldn't work out what they could possibly be eating.
- To me it's always been a no-brainer. Maybe I'm just simplistic about it, but if you believe in equality of opportunity, and want to champion equality of opportunity, that makes you a feminist.
- If you take over a programme from a longstanding incumbent, not everyone's going to like it.
- The atmosphere in the newsroom could be pretty poisonous. When I arrived, the people who worked on the 'Six' were sitting there slagging off what had gone out on the 'One.' I thought: 'What is this place? And what are you saying about me?'
- You don't have doubts when you get offered 'Question Time.' You think, thank you very much.
- I've been a journalist for too long to stop calling myself a journalist, and also when I'm doing 'Fake or Fortune?' I'm going through a rigorous investigation.
- Antiques Roadshow' is a public service. It reflects the nation back to itself, as does 'Question Time.'
- Age is definitely an issue for women in TV. There comes a point - especially if you're a woman - when your career just falls off a cliff. I'm not being self-pitying. That's just the way it is.
- I think it's important to rebel a little bit.
- I'd set out to Oman in search of luxury with culture and family-friendly adventure thrown in. And I found it.
