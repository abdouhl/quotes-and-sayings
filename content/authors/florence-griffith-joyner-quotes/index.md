- I have been running since I was 7. I was trying to restructure the way my body was made instead of trying to master the way I ran. I would get so frustrated with my starts in practices that I would just cry. When I ran, I wouldn't even try to get out of the blocks, I would just run.
- People want to think that staying in shape costs a lot of money. They couldn't be more wrong. It doesn't cost anything to walk. And it's probably a lot cheaper to go to the corner store and buy vegetables than take a family out for fast food.
- I love working with kids, talking with them and listening to them. I always encourage kids to reach beyond their dreams. Don't try to be like me. Be better than me.
- I used to be teased for the way I wore my hair at school. I used to do things like wear a different-colored sock on each leg.

- If you want to run as fast as the men, you've got to train like the men.
- I don't do drugs. I never have taken any drugs. I don't believe in them.
- That's what I'd like to do on the President's Council. Make sports and athletics available to every youth in America, not just one day a week like it was for me, but every day.
- I was always doing something physical. My brothers and I used to have handstand contests. We'd walk around the projects on our hands and see who could get the farthest. I was always playing football with them, basketball or racing in the street.
- When anyone tells me I can't do anything... I'm just not listening any more.
- I don't always have the best eating habits. I like butter and ice cream. There are days when I should work out and I don't. But it's never too late to change old habits.
- I like being unconventional.
- I couldn't wait until I grew up. I used to look at my mom's stockings and put them on with her high heels and mess with my hair.
- A muscle is like a car. If you want it to run well early in the morning, you have to warm it up.
