- People know who I am or are fans of 'Chelsea Lately,' and that makes my shows more fun. People know I'm silly and are on board with what I'm bringing to the table. I see the boyfriends who got dragged to the show by their girlfriends, and by the end, they're laughing harder than anybody. That's the best feeling: 'I knew I was going to get you.'
- I'm from a small town in North Carolina and went to a small college and didn't think that someone like me could make a living in L.A. doing comedy. I worked hard, especially in college, but at that age, you don't know what's next.
- I worked with the Groundlings, doing sketch comedy and improv at a theater here in L.A. It was my hobby, but I took classes and stayed passionate about it because it's what I wanted to do. It just fit. It takes a while before you can actually make money at it. I worked for years.
- I would say my career is in a very good place. I'm in a place of a lot of hope for what's next. I see something great, but I'm not quite there.
- My Southern heritage is a big part of who I am. I grew up around people who seemed like characters but are actual, real people. My grandmother made sure I had manners and all that stuff.
- I do comedy at a lot of colleges, and at the end of those shows, I take time to be a little more real with audiences. I try to inspire them to follow their dreams. When I was that age, it was incredible to hear stuff like that.
