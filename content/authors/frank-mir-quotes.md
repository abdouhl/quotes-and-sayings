- I want to fight for as long as possible.
- I'm pretty well-spoken guy, but I don't have a college education. Me making money in other avenues is not going to be as easy as walking into the Octagon.
- All my kids will train in martial arts; it's a requirement. Do I want them to fight professionally? Hell no. If they ever step into a cage, I'll cry. I would rather my daughter and sons be doctors and lawyers or wear a suit to work and use their brain and after work go train at the gym and spar hard.
- Who you fought is a test of who you really are.
- Brock Lesnar will never be able to beat me because he has no submission skills. What's he going to do, knock me out?
- I'm going to work on finishing Mark Hunt, but he's very hard to hold down. I feel like that's the best opportunity for victory for me.
- When I was 22, I had the opportunity to work as a bouncer. I only had to work one or two nights and could make enough money to spend the rest of my time training.
- Fedor has great killer instinct, he's tough, he's strong. If I fought him I'd try to catch him in a submission, but I don't know if Fedor can be beaten.
- It has always been a dream of mine to fight in Japan.
- In the UFC, you are only as good as your last fight. It's really a fight-by-fight type of career in the UFC.
- I think the more that people appreciate the sport, the more they're a fan of it.
- Different martial arts have ways of showing you how to control an opponent and put him down, but jiu-jitsu is the king of how to finish somebody. And that's what I love about it.
- I very much like the Japanese version of pro wrestling, probably the most.
- By training with Ken Hahn, who comes from that full-contact karate school where he's hitting me in the back of the head while I'm hitting the bag, I learned that pain is a temporary state.

- Those guys at AKA know how to make adjustments.
- You always see the guys who go, 'Walk away from a fight,' and people look at him and go, 'You're not really a fighter anyways. Are you walking away because you're strong or because of your cowardice?'
- I think the day of retirement will come when I go out there and do everything I was supposed to do and I still can't perform. I'm going out there and I'm a danger to myself, then it stresses your family out.
- I'm not an unintelligent individual.
- I want to fight Lesnar. I hate who he is as a person.
- Whenever I do something in life, I take it as far as I can take it. A lot of people think the easy road is to avoid adversity. But trust me, when you're an old man, you're not going to remember why you didn't do those things.
- When it comes to wrestling, judo and boxing they are at a good level. They can compete in an international level. On the amateur level it is extremely high. Transitioning to MMA for them would be easy. I think we will see a lot more Cubans in MMA as it gets easier for them to complete.
- Competing is something that once I retire from, it's not something I can go back and do.
- To have an effective striking match, you need gloves on. Junior dos Santos would have a very short career if he was in a bare knuckle fight. The early UFCs, before gloves, were grappling with some striking.
- Someone who sees you on a certain night, maybe they've seen you on a bad night. I've seen Tom Brady throw interceptions. Is it time to retire, or is it a bad game? What if all week in practice he looked phenomenal?
- I've finished fights from my feet, I've finished fights with my ground-and-pound, and I've finished fights from my back with a submission, from top with submission. You name it, and I've finished a fight that way.
- The margin for error with Mark Hunt is a lot smaller than it is with some of the other heavyweights where you can get caught with a shot and maybe recover.
- I am one of the very few fighters who doesn't read any type of media.
- I love leg locks and heel hooks and kneebars. They're complex and hard to avoid.
- At least my situation I can be like, look, I avoid physical confrontations, obviously not because I have an issue with physical violence, but I try to see the bigger picture of what it takes for humans to coincide with each other. We're all the same race.
- For my striking, I've learned to adapt it right off the bat for MMA. Even my jiu-jitsu, I adapt it very much for MMA.
- For some reason I didn't have a lot of social skills, I didn't date a lot of girls. I always had the thing where I was in love with one girl.
- I've been around long enough to know that you never say never.
- I respect Brock, all the other fighters, and the sport of mixed martial arts.
- Fedor is kind of hard to nail down to one company.
- When people are pushing me against the cage, in the past I was more susceptible to allowing it to happen because I had that jiu-jitsu mentality that I'm not going to grind back.
- I'm not going to question Brock's legitimacy.
- I've watched guys in pro wrestling actually die. It's very dangerous. It's very injury heavy.
- I've trained in wing chung, jeet kune do, I've indulged in many arts that people would not have thought I have trained in and incorporated.
- I just love fighting. You lock me in there with another guy - that strategy, that game of chess - I'm in love with it. I'll be in love with it until the day I die. Now, if you want to strap a belt on me at the end of it? That's cool, my kids can brag about it.
- A lot of individuals are so worried about being politically correct. I'd rather go ahead and say what's on my mind than to sit there and come up with some PC 'Oh, the guy is a great fighter and I have a lot of respect for him.' If I don't mean it, why is it even coming out of my mouth?
- I enjoy fighting.
- I love martial arts, so why wouldn't I want to help people understand it more?
- There are too many fights in our sport that are exciting, and you've got to let us fight.
- As a martial artist you have to be truthful about yourself so you can approach your training properly and get better.
- You have to know how to move properly. A lot of these heavyweights go out there and they're fighting like it's a street fight. They're trying to win in the first 30 seconds.
- Indifference is what death is for us as fighters.
- There's guys that wish they were you, so they hate you for being you. And if you add the fact that you're well-spoken and good-looking... man, I got a lot of people that don't like me.
- I watched guys who were professional fighters hit each other 30 times, and it still didn't go anywhere. I thought 'that wasn't very effective' But I saw if you got someone in a choke, you can end a fight in seconds, and I pushed toward that.
- I'm all for CM Punk becoming a part of the organization. I think his background and training in martial arts, he should be capable of handling himself and doing well. And bottom line is, people are going to tune in to watch and that's pretty much the bar of getting into the UFC, if you can sell tickets.
- People don't usually have long careers as heavyweights because they mature into the role. Look at amateur wrestling, you don't usually see guys go to heavyweight as freshman. I was just blessed that even though I wasn't as big as some of the other guys, I was able to step in right away at heavyweight.
- Having my own gym is easier because I have my family here, my kids enjoy watching my practices and I like having them around. It's hard to go to other people's gyms because not everyone if as kid-friendly as I am.
- If you look at a lot of the best kicking footwork in the sport, karate has a huge influence. You can't be effective with it if you don't apply it correctly, however. You look at Conor McGregor, who is known for his boxing, but when I watch him fight I see a lot of karate movement with how he goes in and out.
- I'd rather fight named fighters and Fedor's somebody I've always wanted to fight and I think that it would be nice to be able to complete that kind of Who's Who of my resume.
- I've always been a fan of martial arts, even before I did jiu-jitsu tournaments. I did point karate tournaments and wrestled in high school. To me, it was just an evolution and mixed martial arts was the next step. I just wanted to compete and train in it. I had no illusions of it being a paying gig.
- I never found striking to be an effective form of fighting. I still clown people and tell them how animals in the wild that are hunted, they have to strike, bulls and rams, they use striking as protective nature. But the ones who are the predators, they're the grapplers who go for the throat.
- I think Matt Mitrione is a super tough guy, very athletic but I think that I'd probably get more pay-per-view buys if I fought Fedor.
- In the future, I'd like to break more into acting and stuff. I think that pro wrestling is a great springboard, really. You see a lot of guys coming from that world. In a lot of ways, it's like live theater. Guys going out there and performing and having to act on the fly and be their own stuntmen at the same time.
- I was having multiple surgeries after fights and not really addressing them the way I should have and having a proper off-season. So it was leading to more injuries and really making a strong influence on the way I was fighting. I was having to fight around injuries and not fight because it was the most efficient technique to use.
- I don't perform well when my family isn't around me.
- It was always a goal of mine to go back to Cuba, where my paternal lineage comes from.
- No one is guaranteed a spot at the top, no one is guaranteed a title shot, but all you can do is win your fight, keep training, and then maybe somewhere down the road you'll get your opportunity.
- With the half-guard and guard, if you have a belly it's hard to pull your knees up.
- I was suspended for two years and I got really fat. That was a polite way of putting it.
- Even I didn't think I could beat Nogueira.
- There are two ways I would consider retirement. One is losing to guys who are not top-level competition. The other is if I started losing where it's like, 'OK man, you were knocked out viciously and staring at the rafters.' I won't endanger my health.
- Growing up in Vegas there is that complaint that we have no sports team. We have boxing, but no boxers are ever from Vegas, they're always from the east.
- I have an ability to overcome adversity. I've got a toughness that helps.
- I thought about 205 for awhile, particular when I was doing the Vegan diet and walking around at about 250lbs. I was counting calories and was serious about whether it was a possibility, but it's just not for me.
- I don't want them to have to be the one to come tell me, 'Hey, you performing at the top of your sport is no longer feasible. Biology has set its course.'
- The sport has to be entertaining, it has to make money. CM Punk brings that.
- It's a disadvantage when there is not enough footage of an opponent.
- In the past, I would try to use as little strength as possible because strength will get you tired if you explode too many times. Well, get in shape.
- Knowledge is just how I am. I like to know things. I'm an inquisitive human being.
- I think just being in there with Fedor is an impressive thing to be able to say at the end of my career, sitting in my office telling people my accolades.
- If you break down actual techniques and knowledge of MMA, I am more knowledgeable than the head coaches of all the guys I'm fighting. Forget the guys I'm fighting. Obviously I know more than they do, nobody is going to question that. But I also know more than the guys who are teaching them about fighting. I could teach them.
- If you were to get a seminar in MMA, I think you'd want one from me over Mark Hunt. I'm more efficient and my understanding of the art is deeper, and I'm still only growing in terms of my intelligence in combat.
- Stipe is a phenomenal champ as far as like he's a good guy, if you want to point your kids in the right direction, 'Hey, look at this guy, he's a good person.'
- I fought Mark Hunt and I got caught with a shot that he threw. That's kind of like getting caught by a submission by me.
- I've been training in martial arts since I was a baby running around the school. Everything from wrestling to muay thai. I started wrestling when I was 15.
- Honestly, I think big guys are easier to fight. They don't move as fast, they get tired quickly and they're not as technical.
- If you fight improperly, you can be in great shape, run marathons, swim 200 meters and I can still gas you in two minutes of a fight. If you don't know how to fight, it doesn't matter.
- The fight ahead of you is always your most important one.
- I haven't fought the easiest opponents. You can show up at your best and still not come out on top.
- I want to constantly get better. Why not just keep fighting? Until I get told that I can't anymore, then I'll move on.
- I remember one time watching Jose Aldo fight Jonathan Brookins, and he just chopped him up.
- At first, when I hit 300 pounds, my wife actually brought that up. She said, 'You do realize you can't walk around like this if you want to train or fight. It doesn't look like you want to fight anymore. Do you want to fight?' That called into question my own reality.
- He doesn't like to be hit. Not that anybody likes to be hit, but Brock for whatever reason has shown much more of a dramatic response to the negativity of those shots. To the point where he's not asleep, it isn't like he got knocked out, he's not getting dropped, but he just turns his face away from adversity.
- I think other fighters can see that I've had hardships, in and out of the cage, and I've persevered and pushed forward. If other people can take that and incorporate it into their lives, then obviously that is rewarding for me to see.
- I've been a pretty big guy my whole life.
- If you don't hit hard and you weigh 260 pounds, that is something to worry about.
- When people are wary about fighting on the ground, I have a more difficult time.
- Georges St. Pierre has the best takedowns and dominant wrestling ability, and he's a great athlete, but he's shown he can be knocked out. I think B.J. Penn is the better fighter. He's the great martial artist.
- If I get too political or if I say things... the whole religious thing, which if you know my background, kind of baffles me anyway. I leave that to the people that are religious and that's their thing. I just try to steer clear of it.
- Anderson Silva I think is extraordinarily talented, but I don't think his submission game is great. We've seen him get caught in heel hooks.
- I think it would be much easier to submit Mark Hunt than to knock him out. The guy has a pretty good chin, he's not the easiest of guys to put away.
- I didn't have anything to prove to begin with to anybody else. I didn't start out doing this because I wanted to win awards or titles. I like martial arts, I like training, I like the lifestyle.
- The dieting thing, I think you have to approach as intelligently as you can. First I started as a vegetarian. And for a whole year, I gave it a shot. And it kept my weight down. But honestly, my body fat wasn't as low - I got a little bit softer. I was getting injured a lot more. I felt a lack of 'umph.'
- You could have 20 wins in a row, and if you lose your next one, you suck now, according to how the fans are.
- I'm a terrible actor.
