- You have more freedom on radio. When people used to tell me they preferred radio to TV, I always thought they were making the best of things because they couldn't get any telly work, but now I understand, sort of.
- I think, as I've gone on, I've got a sense that there are some laughs I want, and some laughs I don't want.
- I have a buoyancy about me, so no matter what happens, even when my parents died, I don't go under.
- I can't swim. I've got better, but I can't go out of my depth. As soon as I smell chlorine my heart starts racing.
- The second gig I did was New Year's Eve at the Birmingham Anglers Club, and that started with booing.
- Well, I think that the most exciting stage of any tour is getting the tour together. Because when new material works, there is no other feeling like that. It's just brilliant. And for the first half of the tour, you're still often finding the extra stuff in that material. You're exploring it every night.
- I have this JPM thing: jokes per minute. I've worked out that I should get in about 12 punchlines in five minutes. I need them all. It's like when you walk down a road, if there's a lamp post that's out, it's fine if you can see the next one's alight, but if there's two out, that's a period of frightening darkness.
- I think I'm quite broad-minded.
- One of the nice things about becoming a stand-up, one of the great things about becoming a stand-up, is you realise you haven't been wasting all those years you thought you'd been wasting.
- I grew up on Laurel and Hardy. I'm aware from my own experience that comedy has got quite a fierce sell-by date, but that doesn't seem to apply to them; they made films I can remember laughing at when I was five that I'd still happily watch today.
- I'm enjoying Channel Four's '10 O'Clock Live.' I like the idea of putting together a dream team and seeing what happens. I also like 'Not Going Out,' the sitcom starring Lee Mack. It's a sitcom packed with jokes. Not many of them as frowned upon as lacking kudos.
- If you can stop thinking, it's like rebooting your brain.
- My dad had a dominoes team, and there was a Frank Skinner in it. When I was a kid I used to look at the team card and think it was a brilliant name, so that's what I went for.
- It is so rubbish when comics belittle their children in the misguided belief that it makes them look cool.
- I wish I had started to play the ukulele much earlier in life.
- Neuromancer' by William Gibson is a cyberpunk classic.
- People are a bit surprised if I say anything bright but I've probably brought that on.
- One of the most exciting things about supporting West Bromwich Albion was watching Johnny Giles play in the late '70s.
- I was a very happy but quite solitary kid. I spent hours playing on my own, mainly with toy soldiers, and played entire World Cup football tournaments in the garden with commentary in my head.
- My mum, Doris, was a source of unalloyed love. She lived for her family and would literally give you her last pound. I think she's made me a kinder person, because I think: Do I want to help this person? If my mum was around, she would have.
- If I'd have had kids in my 20s it would have been nightmarish.
- I remember when I turned 30 and I started doing sit-ups, I split with my girlfriend and stopped drinking and all sorts of things. It was a very weird time. But 60... I like it.
- I don't know anything about politics, so I don't do political material.
- I'm quite testosterone intolerant, I just don't like it.
- I think it is a humanising thing, comedy.
- I have spoken to many broadcasters about bringing poetry to television and they're usually not keen.
- When I started earning, a lot of me didn't need worrying about anymore, so I had scope to worry about someone else. Money, I think, has made me kinder.
- I did a tour of Sweden with Eddie Izzard in our early days, and he said, 'I'm thinking of talking about being a transvestite on stage. You should talk about being a Catholic.' I said, 'I think audiences will be more accepting of you being a transvestite than me being a Catholic.'
- I stopped drinking before I became a comic; one was a replacement for the other.
- On radio there's an obligation to be funny or interesting, and ideally both.
- I never mind people who can't stand football. It's the ones who say 'I quite like it' that get me. Because for me it's all-encompassing.
- I don't want a Lamborghini. Even if I was given one, I'd be like one of those people who won the speedboat on 'Bullseye' and have it in Exchange & Mart within 48 hours.
- Throughout the day I suddenly get bursts of excitement about not very much at all, like those things in public toilets that puff out air freshener.
- I actually like - if I may use the F word - fame. I like people stopping me in the street and saying, 'Can I have a photo?'
- I like to turn up my collar when I'm leaving the theatre and feel like I'm some heroic comedian figure.
- I suppose that every relationship I have been in has had a lot of arguments. I find it very hard to keep things at the bickering level.
- I stopped drinking on 24 September 1986.
- The edge of inappropriate is the spiritual home of the best stand-up comedy.
- That's the way I like my posh people, up front. I like the fact that Jack Whitehall will talk about being posh, or David Mitchell.
- Being a comic is the best possible job.
- Fame changes you and I suppose I stopped biting my lip for a while. I started to point out when people weren't doing their job properly.
- I think Jimmy Carr is very funny and probably the most industrious comedian I know and I really respect him for that.
- I think I was probably a 60-year-old man in waiting for most of my life. Even as a child I had something of the man in my sixties about me.
- Sometimes when you start improvising on stage, which I do a fair bit of, obviously you haven't planned it. But to be honest, it's not like I'm one of these blokes who is sitting at home pouring it all out and then does a different thing on stage.
- I thought I used to be as 'me' on stage as it's possible to be, but on the radio show I found it's possible to be more 'me.'
- I have seen pretty horrible blokes thinking they can do pretty much what they like over the years, not just in showbusiness but in ordinary jobs and in pubs and stuff.
- I would like to talk about poems like I talk about football.
- I quite like being a 'comedy elder statesman.' I am a big fan, I go to watch loads of new comics, and I like the fact that they don't go, 'Why are you here?'
- I can't tell you why, but I feel like I'm more me on radio than on television. It's because I'm more relaxed. The reason I feel that way is a mystery to me, mind you.
- There is a period in your life when you need your parents and a period in your life where you only think you need your parents. Something clicks, there's a little switch that goes and your parents, who had been the wind beneath your wings, through no fault of their own can start to oppress a bit, can start to stop you doing stuff.
- I used to do homophobic material that I didn't recognise as homophobic. It's the only stuff I really look back on and think, 'I just wouldn't do that again.'
- I'm prepared to stand by what I say.
- Sometimes a poem appeals to me technically, just because of the way a line feels on my lips. Sometimes it is because it says something I have felt, or sometimes something that I suddenly recognise. Other times it can change the way I see something.
- I suppose when I started out I didn't know the kind of comic I wanted to be at all. So in a way, the audience wrote my act. I went in and did stuff that I would have done in the pub, and some of it they liked, and some of it they didn't. And I kept what they laughed at.
- I was pleased Melissa Leo won Best Supporting Actress for 'The Fighter' at the Oscars. I hope that her outfits are maintained in some cinema museum.
- Poetry has always been this completely alien art to me. I am the sort of bloke who, when he gets into things, generally tries to have a go at doing them. But I've never thought I could write poetry.
- Alcoholic is a big word, but I'd have a hard time defending myself against it in court.
- I have never managed to find a sport I'm good at - I love sport but I just can't do it.
- I don't think that I'm a misogynistic person at all.
- If you strip a lot of performers to the core, you find that urge to show off.
- I think when anyone says you look like a famous person you fiercely deny it, and then go around hoping other people will say it, too.
- For me personally, being a comedian is having funny ideas and saying them: it's not just saying them. I need the complete process.
- I don't like taboo subjects and I don't like elephants in the room. If there's an elephant in the room, I really want to absolutely examine it.
- I did a few mainstream clubs in Birmingham when I started out. Racist comedy was absolutely the norm. Every act was doing it and when blokes talked about their wives or women in any way it was always derogatory.
- I'm not a man with many plans, but offers come in and I think this one or that one will be really interesting, so I say yes.
- There's only one thing more embarrassing than the celebrities talking about politics; and that's politicians talking about anything other than politics.
- After I became a professional comedian, I took to listening to Cash's classic hit 'Ring of Fire' before I went on stage. I always found it completely exhilarating.
- It's important that comedians talk about difficult and dangerous subjects; you have to be very careful that you don't just hear the subject heading and think, oh, this is bad, they shouldn't be talking about that. You have to hear what's being said.
- Not being a naturally-good-looking-ladies-man type of bloke, I hadn't had a tremendous amount of success with women. So when celebrity opened the door, I went a bit barmy.
- There is a sense that if you're not on the telly then you might have died. I'm aware that's how people largely judge you.
- I like proper jokes. I don't like people who get applause because the audience agree with them.
- I've always been wary of anyone who calls themselves a 'shock comic.'
- Now that I've met posh people, I think you meet some you like and some you don't.
- I don't know what new laddism was really.
- I don't get many compliments on my looks.
- If you earn a lot of money you should pay a lot of tax.
- The Daily Mirror called me a 'money-grabbing reptile' once. I could cope with the reptile part, but 'money-grabbing' hurt.
- Alcoholism and country music are both tremendous aids to self-dramatisation.
- For clothes I usually go to Ben Sherman.
- I haven't had fun since the 1980s!
- I don't think I'm in love with television. I think I'm in love with stand-up, and I'm in love with radio. And then, television is my employer.
- Scarily, I was only about 11 or 12 when my mum pointed out my resemblance to Stan Laurel. I know he's the ultimate loser, but I was happy to hear it.
- Now, although I did some jobs that I really hated doing, my God, they really make you appreciate it when you get a job that you love doing.
- I think part of being human is jokes.
- This might sound slightly ridiculous but I play the ukulele for at least an hour a day and I find something really blissful about it.
- I can't remember ever being desperate for money, even when I didn't have any.
- Dad was a keen Roman Catholic, but I left the church when I was 17, not because I'd stopped believing - it was more doctrinal stuff, like that there was no biblical mention of purgatory. I went back when I was 28, just before I gave up drink.
- I love touring. Not just the shows, I love hotels. I love motorway services at three o'clock in the morning. I like long car journeys, so I like all the trimmings basically.
- As you get older, your injuries don't come with an anecdote any more, they just come.
- I must have been one of the few New Lads who was teetotal.
- I'd rather be looked down on than beaten up.
- You can be funny about your kids without being unkind.
- The first live gig I ever saw was Johnny Cash at the Birmingham Odeon in 1971. I was 14 and went with my dad.
- I read comic books when I was a kid. Now I have a passion for art and galleries that I think came from that. I didn't read a book without pictures until I was 21.
- Being on your own in a gallery is the biggest treat, as long as the lights are switched on.
- My dreams are things like: I'm in the supermarket, I queue, and then I leave the supermarket. It's basically my life but I happen to be asleep.
- I'd got into Cash after I'd used my pocket money to buy his 'Live at San Quentin' album, just because I liked the cover. It turned out I liked the record inside even more.
- My comedy is my life turned into jokes. I think a lot of people wouldn't like that because you end up talking about stuff where you don't always come out so well. You have to be prepared to say, 'This is me, being a prat.'
- My dream has always been to live somewhere in London where the chimneys look as if they could have been used in 'Mary Poppins.'
- I love being able to talk about anything.
