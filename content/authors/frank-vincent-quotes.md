- When you're acting on camera, you don't really think of your voice. You think of the whole instrument - your body, your look, and whatever you have to do. But when you're doing the voiceover, you're thinking only of your voice. You really can't compare the two different mediums.

- People approach you in a different way when you're a celebrity - some are nice, some are not nice.
