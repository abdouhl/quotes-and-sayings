- I coach at Rutgers University and help out there as a part-time assistant coach. I feel like the coach is kind of in me, and it would also be great exposure, so I'd be down for it, for sure.
- We're not getting judged or rated by just our fighting ability. People want to watch guys who are flamboyant and have something to say, and that's just the nature of the fight game and the game we're in. I get it.
- Nothing comes easy. I'm OK with that. If I think I'm the best guy, I should be able to beat anybody.
- I'm into a lot of music, definitely a lot of rap. 'Dedication 4', the Lil' Wayne album. Actually, I've been getting into some Swedish house music; the beat just keeps me going a little bit.
- You learn a lot as a coach when you sit back and tell someone what to do, and then you realize, 'Hey, I need to start doing that myself.' I think coaching can improve a fighter's game tremendously.
- I get a lot of attention, maybe not as much as a lightweight in B.J. Penn or someone like that, but my time is coming.
- I never picked fights. I'm never going to start to pick fights. If they ask me to fight someone, I'll say yes.
- I believe a lot of techniques and stuff has to do with confidence, and I think as my confidence grows, everything else will grow as well.
- I need a little more 'Jersey Shore' in me, I guess. It's just not who I am. It would almost be phony at this point.
- Everybody says they're going to knock me out, and no one's done it yet.
- I got two young kids, so as much as I train a lot, free time is spent with my kids.
- You always have to play it safe, no matter who you're fighting. I don't fight any easy guys. I haven't maybe ever in the UFC. To me, you've always got to be safe. But I don't want to have my foot on the brake at all. My foot is going to be on the gas, and I'm going to be smart at everything.
- I don't know if you want to call it, like, 'an old school guy' or what, but you've got to go out there; you've got to perform in order to get what you want. I'm willing to put my skills on the line and put my heart on the line just to say I'm the best and prove that I can achieve this title.
- I always tell people, 'The week after your fight is just a very good time.' You get to release, relax, unwind mentally - everything.
- I'm still here. I'm still gunning for that title. I'm not going anywhere.
- There's nothing like going to real live UFC events. It's unbelievable.
- Best memories - obviously, winning a title for the first time. Probably my last fight against Gray Maynard where I was able to finish him for the trilogy. Those were definitely great moments. The worst moments are the losses, for sure.
- I feel like I'm still improving, still getting better, and I have a lot more to give in this sport.
- Best matchup? You know, I don't really know. It doesn't really matter, and whoever has the belt would be fine for me.
- Let's be real: it's not always the No. 1 contenders who get the title shots. It's who they invest money in and who's kind of a known name. In the lighter weights, just being that I fought seven title fights in a row, I think I'm that guy.
