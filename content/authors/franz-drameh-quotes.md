- There is a very diverse range of superheroes, especially with the Firestorm character. In the comics, there is a black Firestorm. But we still don't see that many black superheroes. So what The CW is doing and what DC Comics is doing with this whole universe with diversity is absolutely amazing.
- I'd really love to check out medieval times. I'm obsessed with that kind of stuff, like on a horseback with a sword.
- I'm always trying to play pranks on people and doing silliness, singing extremely badly and extremely loudly on set.
- Changes can be made. New decisions can be made. If people say, 'It's not like that in the comics!' Well, comic books reinvent their characters a lot. They do different things with them all the time. They're always changing, always keeping things fresh. So that shouldn't be an issue if the race changes for a character.
