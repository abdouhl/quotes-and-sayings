- I adore clothes. More importantly, I admire people who dress well.
- I do want people to think of me as an actor, not just a posh actor who does posh parts.

- People want to see me as a posh square, so I'll play an East End drag queen or a young man with a cleft palate.

- My dad has never had a mobile phone or computer. And that was the way when I grew up, so I still take tech with a pinch of salt.
- It gets me, physical comedy. There's nothing better than it.
- I love a good suit, and when I see photographs of myself in a jacket that doesn't fit me quite right or the sleeves are too long, it drives me insane.
- If I don't shave I look like a peach with fuzz on it - not a good look.
- So often gay characters, particular those portrayed in an era where gayness was something of a taboo and a statement about 'who I am and no one's going to trample me down,' are more colourful and interesting - and for an actor, that's enticing.
- Umm, I used to stink-bomb peoples' letterboxes on the weekends when their newspapers were delivered.

- I suppose what I look for most in a part, other than it being different than the part before, is: Does he interest me? Will I have fun getting to know him and, to a greater or lesser degree, physically embodying him?
- Now, I don't think I'd particularly care if somebody criticised me for having got to a certain level of success because I'm Ed Fox's and Joanna David's son. I know that's not true.
