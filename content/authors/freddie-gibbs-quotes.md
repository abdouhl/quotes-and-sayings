- Madlib isn't a beatmaker, he's a producer.
- Different rappers got different talents. It's like X-Men.
- I'm just glad we get to see old records being broken. That's what sports is all about.
- Ain't nothin' changed with me. I'm Eastside Gary til I die.
- I always knew that I would be some type of public figure, but I never knew that it would be rapping, 'cause my dad sang: I saw him deal with the ills of the music industry, just on the outside looking in.
- I'd be a liar if I didn't say I learned things from Jeezy. Hell yeah, I took some things, some pluses and some minuses, do's and don'ts.
- 'Kind of Blue' is one of the best records of all time. Miles' use of space is something rap fans can definitely appreciate. Sometimes you have to let the track breathe and throw a melody in here and there. He never did too much on 'Kind of Blue.' It's the perfect vibe.
- I just have to go against the grain. I mean, I can be objective and do what I need to do, handle my everyday living, follow directions, etc. But there's something that's always been attracted to that taboo. It's been like that since I was a child.
- Coming up in America in the '80s and '90s, we were not too far removed from slavery. People forget that.

- I've always played that role in my family: the breadwinner.
- I don't really know what a debut album is no more. As long as you got music on the streets, you've debuted.

- I played wide receiver in high school; then I went to college at Ball State and played safety.
- I look at some of my fans at my show, and a lot of them look like they're straight out of a punk rock show. They like what I'm coming across with. I had seen them same thing when I went to this Scarface show, so it lets me know that I'm on the right track.
- You've got a lot of Tupac clones, but I don't think I'm one of them. I just think I give people a little piece of the feeling he gave them.
- I like A$AP Rocky and his stuff - Kendrick too.
- I can do a whole project with Madlib and turn around and do a record with Gucci Mane. Gucci Mane, E-40, and Black Thought on the same record. I like all those rappers, so why can't I work with them in some type of capacity? It just speaks to my versatility. I don't just listen to one type of rap. I listen to all of it so I can make all of it.
- My mom had me at a young age, like 20, and she was the oldest child. All her brothers were seven and 10, so I was like a younger brother more so than the oldest child. I was the younger brother to all my uncles, so they were going through their childhood and their teenage years, and I was right there.

- Sports is one of the keys to my life. It definitely kept me out of a lot of trouble and gave me a lot of discipline.
- Tupac is definitely an icon. There'll never be another Tupac, so I'm not gonna ever, ever try to fill those shoes. I'm just gonna stay in my lane and be the best me that I can be.
- My core thing is gangster rap, but a lot of my music is melodic and carries a message of survival.
- Gary is a old factory town right outside Chicago. From my standpoint, my family migrated there in the '50s and '60s from Mississippi - Sardis, Mississippi - shout out to Sardis, Mississippi. My family migrated there just like a lot of black families in that area: they migrated there to get jobs, to get those factory jobs, that steel mill job.
- I never write a song before I get the track because I just feel that I have to make a marriage with that track with my raps. And if it's something that's already there, it ain't gone really fit, I don't think.
- I tried to watch 'Inception,' but I fell asleep.
- Eminem heard my music, and he didn't wanna take a meeting with me.

- A lot of improvisation and freedom went into 'Pinata.'
- Gary is a really impoverished town; it's in industrial decay. There's low employment and things of that nature.
- I don't like pre-written raps; I think it makes the song better if you listen to the beat first. In a sense, you have to make a marriage with the beat. I ride the beat, hear the flow of the drums, get the melody of my flow, and then from that point, it's a process of what I want to say.
- I have a respect for Young Jeezy. But the reason things didn't work out for me and Young Jeezy was because our approach to the industry... My approach to the industry was a tad bit different than his. I wanted to approach my career a different way; he wanted to go a different way.
- I wanted to be in the NBA. I wanted to be in the NFL.
- After I got dropped by Interscope, I knew in my heart that I had to fight back some way or not rap at all. I just took it upon myself to get myself where I needed to be.
- I'm not a big video game dude though, but I like 'Madden.'
- Ninety percent of the general public aren't gangstas, so all of the rappers aren't going to be gangstas.

- The neck is not something you should have surgery on that much.
- Stuart Scott was a hero.
- I'm a loyal dude.
- I've been known not to bite my tongue.
- Me separating from CTE - I'm extremely happy about that because a lot of guys wrote me off, Jeezy included. He really wrote me off.

- The Bears need to let me be GM.
- I started hustling in early adolescence.
- Every project might only sell like 30 to 50,000, but I mean, I'm getting seven, eight dollars every CD. I make more money per record than an artist on a major label - I can definitely say that.
- If you say your product is the best, back that up.
- I'm trying to bring gangster rap back to the forefront, like in the early '90s.

- It's in the American spirit to take advantage of an opportunity.
- I remember I used to go school with guys who couldn't afford notebooks, pens, paper: the necessary tools needed in order to survive in school. It's a lot of kids in Gary who are at a disadvantage without that.

- I'm from Gary, Indiana, and everybody's damn near at the poverty level. It's a rough city to grow up in, and it's a modern-day ghost town.

- Probably dancing to Cassie's 'Me & U' - That's my guilty pleasure.
- I had a nightmare that I was mopping floors and that this Freddie Gibbs thing was all a dream.
- I'd be quiet as a mouse if I didn't have the correct feeling about my music. I feel like I'm able to talk about it and say I'm one of the best because I think I got the music to back that up. I got the live show to back that up. That's all that matters.
- I feel like some artists need a record label, and some don't.
- I've been engulfed in sports since I was a 2-year-old; I picked up any kind of ball - a basketball, baseball, football - I just loved to play something. I loved the energy of being in arenas and watching the game on TV.
- My father took me to a lot of sports events as a child, and our TV stayed on ESPN.
- I wasn't fully aware of the things that Madlib did musically, but my manager put me up on game. I'm not gonna act like I was a Madlib head when I wasn't. I didn't understand a lot of it at first. But it opened my mind to some things, and it's me bringing that gangster element to things that he does. It's like a perfect marriage.
- When everybody goes left, I'm gonna go right most of the time.
- I'm not trying to obey the rules of radio.
- My TV stays locked at 'SportsCenter.' That and 'Pardon the Interruption.'

- When I first came in the game, I had a bunch of homies that rapped that was hanging around me just because I was getting the rap attention, and they felt they could feed off of that.
- We have good, neighborly people in Gary.
- I study my competition for at least an hour a day. I get on the Internet, I look at what they doing, and then I look at ways to defeat them. I know their mixtapes track-by-track. I know some of their lyrics.
- I grew up on N.W.A., Geto Boys. My dad was listening to that.
- I never took a dollar from Young Jeezy. No advance, nothing.
- I want to be one of the most versatile rappers in the game.
- I'm like LeBron, man. I'm like a smaller LeBron. That's why I'm not in the NBA. If I had about five, six more inches, I'd be in the league.
- I'm not really comfortable with being on songs with cats I don't really know.
- I went to a Bulls game when it was still in Chicago Stadium before they built the United Center.
- I'm not trying to act like I'm Superman or better than anybody else in the game. I'm just telling my story, showing my strengths and weaknesses - as a human, as a person, as a man.
- This is the land of getting over. The land of second or even third chances; the land of doing whatever you have to do by any means necessary in order to fulfill the American Dream.
- I think that 'Pinata' album is going to stand the test of time. It's going to be a moment in hip-hop, whether people know it or not. It's nothing else like that in rap. It's going to forever hold its place.
