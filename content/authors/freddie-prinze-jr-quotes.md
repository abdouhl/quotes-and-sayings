- Tap dancing is something I love, and I've been working on it to get really good.
- When I was in high school. I was considered really weird and strange, and people kind of kept their distance.
- I always appreciated that connection between a parent and a kid because I yearned for it so much. Growing up, I wanted a father, and because I've had this idea of what a father should be, it's exciting to finally have the opportunity to try and be that guy, to see if I can actually do it.
- I did '24;' it was terrible. I hated every moment of it.
- I was just after Generation X. I missed the John Hughes movies; I had to watch them on TBS.
- Shooting in Brooklyn is like opening a time capsule. Nothing has changed. Everything looks like it did in the eighties.
- When I was a kid, 'Star Wars' was it. Like, it's in your DNA. I'm old enough to have seen the original one.
- It only takes 30 seconds to pluck my eyebrows, but it hurts. I have to tweeze 'em in the middle once a week. Otherwise, I look like Bert from 'Sesame Street.'
- My god-father, Bob Wall, was in a couple of Bruce Lee movies, and he trained Bruce Lee when he came to America.
- One person who has taught me a lot and inspired me a lot was Peter Falk. I was fortunate enough to have worked with him in this movie called 'Vig.' He brought my work to a place where it literally shouldn't have been for another two or three years.
- I've heard, 'May the Force be with you' about as many times as, 'Hey, how you doing?'
- I love food, man! If it doesn't eat me first, I'll pretty much eat it.
- It's so easy to be selfish in your 20s and not want to sacrifice.
- I've never seen 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer.'
- I really don't go to any parties.
- I just want people to recognize my father as an artist who was way ahead of his time. He was a genius. His life just burnt out quicker than it should have. And that is unfortunate, but what is more unfortunate is that everybody focuses on the nature of his death as opposed to the nature of his life, which was so much greater and more important.
- People don't think I can construct a sentence, let alone write a script.
- I don't know if acting is genetic. Maybe it's environmental.
- I didn't see 'Star Wars' in theaters until George Lucas re-tweaked it.
- The '80s were all about 'Saturday Night's Main Event.'
- I was raised to believe in myself. I know I'm cool. I'm not trying to brag or say I'm the man or anything like that. I don't lie or cheat, and I'm not mean to anybody. I treat people with respect.
- I don't really read magazines that much. I read comic books.
- I played Little League. I was a 'pitcher.' But we had a pitching machine, so I was just basically an 'in-infield' shortstop because all I got to do was field bloopers six feet from the plate. I couldn't hit, so that was pretty much my entire job.
- I really fight hard to make things film where they're supposed to be filmed. If something is supposed to be in New York, then it has to be in New York.
- I know throughout my childhood, there were many times I couldn't stand being a 'Jr.' I wouldn't want anybody else to go through that. If we'd had a boy, he wouldn't have been another Freddie Prinze.
- The first thing I did when my career started moving was to buy a small house.
- A couple of years ago, right before I made 'Down to You,' there was a moment when I questioned what I was doing and if it meant anything. I felt like I wasn't accomplishing anything, that the goals I'd set were silly goals. Finally, I realized I just loved acting. It was a very clear moment, and my whole life changed then.
- The Latinos were doing the five-name thing long before celebrities made it cool. We've been doing things like Antonio Ricardo Luis Raoul Hector Rivera for a while now.
- I think success shows a person's true colors.
- When I was a kid, everybody loved Hulk Hogan, right? 'Eat your vitamins. Eat your vegetables.' Everybody over 25 hated him because he was corny, right?
- Girls in L.A. don't eat anything! I'll say, 'You look hungry. I'm not kissing you till you're full because I'm afraid you're going to bite my lip.'
- High school's like another planet.
- I would have loved to have played Spider-Man.
- I follow my heart in almost every instance, and it gets me in trouble most of the time. But I don't care. I think that's the best way I can live.
- People who have seen my movies don't look at me like an idol. They just give me a lot of love and respect.
- My first job was four words in 'Family Matters.' It was huge!
- When I was in school I read a lot of comic books and pretend I was in them and kids would tease me and call me names. But now I do the same things and people say that I'm artistic and cool and I'm doing the exact same thing I did in high school.
- A car just gets me from A to B. I really don't spend that much time driving.
- I'm a full-time dad; I'm a part-time actor.
- My old man taught me a lot of stuff in his death that I don't even know if he would have been able to teach me had he been alive. And that was to never do stuff that can jeopardize the people you love and hurt them.
- I know how to create and make people feel something. Honestly, if I didn't do this, I would just have some minimum-wage job in New Mexico, and I would go out on the weekends and make just enough money to pay my insurance and pay for a couple beers, and that would be it.
- I don't know what my daughter will become.
- Speaking Spanish isn't a benefit in Hollywood.
- Living life at a young age is like being a sponge thrust into the ocean. You absorb what's around you. If you're around people who are supportive and positive, that's how you look at the world.
- I really don't like hurting people; I like making people feel good.
- Personally, when things upset me, I get quiet and closed off. I have nothing to say, and a chill sets in while I think about what's going on.
- Life is not about making dough or how many movies you can make in a year. It's about finding someone that you can share things with.
- I grew up all over the place, but the majority of my years were spent in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
