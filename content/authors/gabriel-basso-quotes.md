- I don't see a lot of nature in L.A. Then again, I don't see a lot when I go back to St. Louis, either.
- I had one of the most outdoorsy childhoods you could imagine. I basically lived in the woods until I was 13. My dad and I built a huge treehouse in our backyard in Chesterfield, about 30 feet in the air. And we'd vacation on an island in Michigan, where I hunted a deer that we ate.
- You're in a scene with Laura Linney or Oliver Platt or John Hickey or Alan Alda and these amazing actors and actresses, and you're like, 'Oh my God, I haven't even started; I'm nothing compared to these people!'
- I think you just have to accept the fact that no one lives forever, and eventually things are going to come to an end, whether it's a TV show or life.
- Rarely do you walk down the street doing anything that my grandparent's generation did. And half of that comes with the technology advances.
- I wish I could play the World Cup; that's one of my dreams.
- I appreciate when people enjoy my work, but I don't like being recognized in public.
- The majority of actor kids are really competitive. But Gabby Sidibe on 'The Big C' has been a big help to me. Her career went from zero to a hundred in about one second, so she's warned me what to expect.
- I love sports - if I'm not acting, I'm probably doing sports.
- I work with people like Spielberg and Abrams all the time.
- I'm an artist. So if acting doesn't work out, which I hope it does, I'm probably going to go into graphic design or something like that.
- I got lost one time for a couple hours. It was pretty bad. I got lost in a creek, and I couldn't find my way back. The cops even had to come.
