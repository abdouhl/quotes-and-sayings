- I think the root of minor problems is separation from a belief system of interconnectedness and compassion and oneness, so when we multiply that over and over again, it turns into lies and chaos and terrorism.
- Happiness isn't for dabblers.
- We are always manifesting. Each thought we have creates an energy flow within and around our physical being. This energy attracts its likeness. So if you're thinking, 'I suck,' then your energy kinda, well, sucks - and you attract sucky experiences.

And if you can have that in your life, if you could feel that feeling in your life, then my prayer would be that your division and your separation, your attack, would dissolve with that boundary.

- I believe that my work has been well-received because it is authentic. All people really want are authenticity and truth.

- As you look at your fears head-on, you'll begin to see how much of what you fear is just False Evidence Appearing Real. When you act on this false evidence, you create chaos in your life.
- 'A Course in Miracles' has been one of my great teachers. I still study 'The Course' daily. It's like a gift that keeps on giving.
- One of the biggest ways we don't support ourselves is by not asking for support. Asking can take courage, but the reward is immense.
- Each thought you have informs your energy, and your energy manifests into your experiences. Your thoughts and energy create your reality.
- I equate physical activity with happiness not just from the perspective of producing endorphins but also from the perspective of really moving through emotions and getting stagnant energy to move through our body.
- The biggest thing I've learned is that it's not about me. All of the things that I do have to be about bringing service to the world and helping people shift their perception.
- I begin each day with prayer and meditation. Throughout the day, I use affirmations and positive intentions to move through blocks, and each evening, I close the day with self-reflection and an inventory of my growth throughout the day.
- I believe I am connecting to angels and spirit guides and ancestors. All of that is falling under the category of God and the energy presence of God, and that is what I can tap into when I tune in and slow down.

- You can't always change your circumstances, but you can change the way you experience them.
- Restful sleep is a key ingredient to living a miraculous life. I'm not saying we need eight or ten hours a night to feel fully rested. In fact, sometimes less sleep can be more restorative than many hours. The key is to have real sleep... the drooling-on-the-pillow kind of sleep.
- My well-being and my happiness is much more important to me than how much I can achieve.
- The practice of being on a spiritual path isn't about being the best meditator or the kindest possible person or the most enlightened. The practice is about surrendering to love as often as possible.

- The Universe is never conspiring against anyone.
- The word 'guru' is very loaded, so I would never refer to myself that way. I see myself as a teacher.
