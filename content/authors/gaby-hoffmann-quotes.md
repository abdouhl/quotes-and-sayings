How do you get to be like that?'

- There's something extremely bizarre about the way people consume media now.
- I was never as famous as all these kids. There was no social media. We weren't celebrity-obsessed as a culture. I feel like these kids are under a crazy microscope; they're basically brands. And they eventually implode and act out. They need a break, and they're not getting one.

- I curate my T.V.-watching quite carefully.

I'm really glad I grew up there.

- I've been very excited to have children for a long time. It definitely added an interesting twist to the night we screened 'Lyle' at Outfest, and I got up to do the Q&A, and I had this huge belly no one was expecting. It creeped everybody out in the best way.
- As an actress, vanity is your enemy. If you're thinking about how you look, you're not going to give a good performance. Once I realized, 'Hmm, I guess I'm not that vain,' it's like something I wanted to protect. I can't imagine anyone could give the full dynamic performance they're capable of and still be vain.

- I made a lot of movies that people loved when I was a kid, but I didn't have any real relationship to them.
- I never set out to be an actor. Again, my mother presented this job by job to me at the time, and if it sounded fun, I would say yes and if it didn't, I would say no. I always knew, since I was 7 or 8 years old, that it was a means to an end and that I wanted to go to college.

- If somebody smiles at me on the street, I'm like, 'Hi, have a nice day!'
- It's true that most people in the trans community don't have the incredible wealth and privilege that Caitlyn does. I don't think that, in any way, diminishes her struggle in her own transitioning.

- My mother certainly never altered the topics of her conversation based on children being present.
- I think being on a set where people aren't being treated as equals, and with just a common level of decency and respect, is really uncomfortable.
- Anything that needs to be accessed is within me. Even if it's in a circumstance that seems outrageous, I can still just go back to the basic human experience and it's all there.

- Acting was something that I grew up just doing. I certainly never thought about it.
- I was obsessed with the idea of going to college. And I took many years off after that, so I sort of missed the weird, crazy transition that was what making movies was in the nineties to what's happening now.
- Every scene is on the table to collaborate on, to pick apart, to try a million different ways. Usually, what ends up occurring in the end is something that no single person knew would happen or had planned for.

- The amount of attention and sensitivity and education that we're getting in terms of specifically the transgender community is great, and certainly that's new to me. But it's not incredibly unfamiliar. I grew up in downtown New York in the '80s.
- People would say, 'Can I hug you?' And I would say, 'Yes, you can hug me! We're fellow New Yorkers!'
- Nicole Richie invited me to her birthday party, and it was at Michael Jackson's Neverland!
