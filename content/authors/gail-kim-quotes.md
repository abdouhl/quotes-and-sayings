- True wrestling fans love a great wrestling match.
- I always believe there's a place in wrestling for a little bit of everything.
- I feel like I have chemistry with every girl but I don't know what happened with Awesome Kong. I never even saw her work before our very first match. I just heard so much about her and then we brought in this whole women's division.
- Of course, having that confidence of having the fans behind you in your hometown is always special.
- I wasn't on television until 25.
- Myself and every Knockout in the company at the beginning worked so hard to build up a credible women's division in TNA so finally holding the title meant so much to me.
- WWE always thinks in a business mindset.
- Wrestling is very physically demanding. You can be in great shape and still not be in ring shape.
- I have lots of people tell me I'm beautiful and ask if I'm a model, but the biggest compliment I got was a fan came up to me and said, 'You're the best female technical wrestler.' That's the one compliment that sticks out.
- When I joined the WWE, Dave 'Fit' Finley was our first agent that we worked with all the time and he brought in another form of aggression in me.

- I always tell everyone wrestling is like the mafia, once you get in, you can't get out.
- Impact Wrestling has never stopped with women's wrestling.
- I heard many times that they want the Divas to be girly. They didn't care about the heel girls getting any heat. We just didn't understand. They did everything in their power, it seemed, to take everything to give us a good match, for the heels to get any heat. It was no kicking one week, or no punching the next. No this, no that.
- I heard about 'GLOW,' but I found out a little too late. I kind of made a run of getting a role training the actresses to show them how to wrestle.
- I enjoy cooking, but I don't know... I just don't think I have enough skills to teach other people.
- As far as I remember, I was always a big eater. I eat just as much as the wrestler guys.

- I didn't know the colors of my wedding or what my bouquet would look like!
- I was very green when I started in WWE and felt very uncomfortable with talking.

- Throughout my career, especially the second half of my career, I was always nerdy or anal when it came to how I prepared for my matches.
- The WWE is the big company and the one the mainstream audience is watching, but I feel like if you were a hardcore wrestling fan, you were watching TNA.
- I've always known of ROH and have worked with a lot of the workers there, but they've never reached out to me. It's just never happened. But I'm always open to everything.
- I know people are going to be surprised to hear me say this because they think I'm such an advocate for women's wrestling... But I truly believe that the best time in wrestling, for me, was when I first got into WWE and they had a strong women's division and they also had girls who strengths weren't in the ring and were more for entertainment.
- In terms of being honored at the TNA Hall of Fame, I think that's something that every pro wrestler dreams about.
- A lot of people that have worked with me know I'm pretty direct.
- Oh my gosh, women have it so much harder than men. If you ask me the differences are professional as well as physical.
- We always tell everyone that women's wrestling has always been told through the lens of a man because it's a male-dominated industry. It's never been told through the lens of a woman and we want to be able to tell that story.
- My honest opinion, and this is only my opinion and I don't know this as fact, I just think Vince McMahon did not like women's wrestling.

- I've always had a lot of pressure on myself, but I'm not going to lie, I feel a lot of pressure to give the fans everything they expect plus more.
- If a hotel has a microwave, I always get a sweet potato and make sure I have a fork and I can microwave a sweet potato. Seven minutes, and I can do that. You really learn how to eat on the road.
- I always wanted to make the matches in some way different unique and interesting. I never wanted to have that basic match. I just wanted us to stand out in some way or another, whether it was storytelling or interesting wrestling moves.
- Impact has always been a great place for camaraderie and feeling like a family.
- Normally, with girls that I know in the business, they start off managing and then they become a wrestler, or they just stay as a manager who can wrestle, but I was always a wrestler.

- Wrestling is one of those things that make me emotional.
- You know, in terms of accomplishments and things like that, I feel like I've accomplished what I've wanted.
- I'm the only female producer on Impact, and they're very supportive, the men.
- Wrestling has progressed to the point that the fourth wall has been broken. People would enjoy more seeing what is behind the superhero that they watch on TV.
- Why would you have a seven-hour show? The fans are going to be so tired halfway through the show.
- People say women's wrestling sucks and nobody wants to see it, but every time there are storylines and they invest in the women, people react and love it.
- When I first saw 'Broken' Matt Hardy, I thought to myself, 'Umm...' I actually said to Jeremy Borash 'Why is he talking like that? Is he trying to make an accent and it's coming out really bad?' And then it kind of grows on you and it's just funny as hell, at least for me.
- The culture or environment of a company starts from the top. The leadership. The leadership of a company sends a message to its employees of what is tolerated and what is not.
- I've noticed a huge difference in my energy level cutting out the red meat. It's crazy.
- I was always into sports.
- Growing up, I would think I want to do this, I want to do that. You change your mind a million times.
- I wish WWE had their own creative team for the girls. They could have an even stronger women's division.
- My back was starting to deteriorate and basically what happened was I just couldn't walk after a couple of matches here and there. I never had an MRI and I never knew what was going on in my body for so long, and then it was coming to point where I was always wrestling and not being able to walk after.
- With the success of the TNA Knockouts, that's when they started having their girls wrestle a lot more in WWE. I thought, 'This is a perfect time for me to come in. They care about women's wrestling.' Sadly it was just not the case.
- When I signed with WWE I was really happy that they had the PG thing going on. I thought, 'Yes! No more bra and panties matches, no bikini contests.'
- WWE is basically scooping up all the talent and making it really difficult. They say they want competition and like competition, but I don't believe that. They are trying to make this a monopoly.
- I want to contribute the best I can to TNA and the Knockouts division. I want to be a part of taking the Knockouts division to another level.
- I've lived a gypsy life and wouldn't know any other way to live.
- I have always said that I will retire when my body starts giving out on me.
- I want racial and gender equality.
- For me, if I had a magical match that I was so proud of, and I had to work the same person after that again, it was always about topping that last thing and being the best.
- I love food. I love to eat. I'm married to a chef. I can't go without food.
- But that's my point on intergender wrestling - I don't like to see things where a man is going to punch a woman. I just think about the kids that are watching. I take that into consideration.
- I'm just glad when I was fighting for us to wrestle I would always have people tell me, 'Gail, women's wrestling is for the bathroom breaks, you know they really don't want to see it.' I would get discouraged a little bit but I was very adamant, so I'm glad that we girls proved them wrong.
- People at WWE would say, 'It doesn't matter if you're the best wrestler,' but I would think about Dean Malenko and Chris Benoit and Rey Mysterio. They weren't necessarily the greatest talkers, but they were great wrestlers. I wanted to be that person.
- I like to lean on making wrestling the most believable, realistic form of entertainment as possible for the most part.
- I do find Twitter to be more negative than Instagram. Instagram is not so bad. I think it's because of the pictures and see a face where on Twitter people forget we are human beings.
- I think change is always scary but also always good.
- Once I started to retire, I was telling all of the girls in my generation, 'Wow I feel like an outsider in this locker room because this whole new generation of women has stepped in,' and that was one of the signs where I said maybe it's time to retire.
- I really didn't know how to eat until I studied nutrition in my second year of college.
- I just want to be as good as I can be with any opponent I have and hear everyone say 'that was her best match ever.'
- I'm very direct and I don't sugar coat anything.
- I think a lot of the time when you just see a lot of beautiful girls it kind of just all blends in together. You want something about yourself to stand out.
- It's so frustrating to be working so hard and know that it's not going anywhere and it doesn't matter.
- The true wrestling fans that watch TNA Impact, I think they've always known. I don't want to say they take it for granted in anyway, but they always just know that TNA and Impact Wrestling are going to give them women's wrestling.
- I know that as a performer how much we rely on the fans for how we feel and react.
- Most of the time a wrestler misses the in-ring action, but because of my back and working with the girls as an agent, I don't miss it.
- Ronda Rousey proved that women can be a draw and an attraction, so WWE followed in those footsteps.
- In high school, I played basketball, volleyball, soccer, baseball, badminton - two sports every season - and I was named female athlete of the year twice.
- I don't think I could do the four or five days a week in the WWE. I feel bad for them.
- I just want everyone to remember me as a great wrestler, that's what I aim to do.
- Of course, I wrestled in Windsor for Scott D'Amore's promotion way back in my very early days. That was at the very, very beginning, when I was working under a mask as La Felina.
- I started becoming an agent and producing before I retired. I was doing double-duty to get my feet wet.
- I would miss the action if I ever stepped away from wrestling.
- Most people when they go to Vegas want to go to places on the Strip and experience the big names. Actually in Las Vegas, I find the best restaurants are off the Strip.
- There are so many girls that are really talented like Sasha Banks and Bayley. I have been lucky enough to work with many generations of girls, so every time you see someone really talented you get that urge to make some magic with that girl.
- Broken Matt Hardy was born in Impact Wrestling and I think he had great memories.
- To have the appreciation from your peers, the fans and the company you work for is the ultimate reward. For me, that has always been ultimate because respect has always been the most important thing to me in this business.
- I'm always looking to top the last match, I'm always looking to entertain the fans and steal the show.
- Tessa Blanchard is a premium athlete and you can't take that away from her.
- I feel that I've worked so hard to gain the respect of the fans and my co-workers.
- Canadians have better chocolates, better candy, better flavors of chips. And Tim Horton's of course.
