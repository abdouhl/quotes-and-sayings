- I love a good fight and I think a bad fight can ruin a movie. I really do.
- No one has a name in 'The Road.' Like Cormac McCarthy's novel from which it's adapted, 'The Road' features characters such as the man, the boy, the wife, the old man and the veteran.
- As a heterosexual man, I've never really doubted my sexuality, but I've had men in my life and thought, 'If I was gay, I'd be with him' - you know?
- But the fact that same-sex marriage is still an issue is insane. Thinking love knows a sex is ridiculous.
- If it's a good story, then everybody is trying to tell it, everybody is better for it, and it's just more fun.
- In the past, if you did film, you couldn't do stage, and if you did film, you certainly didn't do television. You had to pick what you wanted to be. Now it seems like we can bounce around, not only between genres, but between mediums, and I like that. I like change and I like a good story.
- The other day, someone called me this generation's Bruce Dern - I'd never thought of that, and frankly, I don't know enough of Bruce Dern's work to comment on it, though he is an incredible actor.
- I have been really lucky in my career, with the diversity of it. I get to play really complex people.
- Everyone thinks their family is the craziest family in the world. Like, 'My God, my family's crazy!'
- Yeah, I like to have fun - I think that's a good way to live. I think you're better at your job if you like it.
- I just like a good story. I want the story to be good and I want the character to be different than the last one I played. That's not always possible, but that's what I want.
- I've long been a fan of Chiwetel Ejiofor. I think he's a great actor. He's my kind of guy. He does what I aspire to do.
- I'm an ensemble guy, I guess - that comes from the theater. If I ever won some kind of award someday, I imagine I'd try to be very gracious, but in the end, I just want to keep working. I don't see why that, if you just put your mind to it and keep sowing the right seeds, you can't keep doing the things you want to do.
- I did the whole rock and roll thing that's coming up. I think you're going to enjoy that! 'Burt Rocks', it's called. I like that he's a dreamer; I like how positive he is. There's a lot of things I think I can learn from Burt.
- I've always liked stories. I'm always reading, ever since I was a kid. I've always been reading and wanting to be in some other world.
- I actually started in comedy, but then after 'Deadwood' I started concentrating on the dramas more. But then I just got tired for raping and killing and figured, 'It's time to do another comedy.'
- I think I have music in me! I had a scholarship to study singing at one point, and I've never really done anything about it. I've done some music on stage, but it's been a long time. It would be kind of fun.
- Brad Pitt is a dude who just wants to make good movies. He's not afraid to surround himself with the greatest actors, which I always appreciate because I've also seen actors who only want to surround themselves with weak actors because it makes them look better. That ends up making a poorer movie.
- I have such a crush on Shirley Manson. I think she's the coolest thing.
- It's kind of my whole philosophy as an actor. I think that's what we're supposed to do is play a wide range of characters - or it's just what I like to do, I should say. I like to try to be as different as I can from one thing to the next.
- Well, one of my favorite ones to work on - besides just about any scene from 'Deadwood' - was my scene with Brad Pitt in 'Assassination of Jesse James'. That was just a fun day.
- You'll see a lot more blood in 'Saw' movies or something like that than you will in either of the 'Last House' movies. I kind of think it owes more to 'The Virgin Spring' which is the original source material, the Bergman movie.
