- I might do 'X Factor' next year. It's looking good that I won't get the sack at Christmas.
- It wasn't not being famous any more, or even not being a recording artist. It was having nobody who needed me, no phones ringing, nothing to do. Because I'm still too young to do nothing. I was only 24 when all that happened. Now, at 40, I feel I've got more to give than I ever have.
- I don't think any of us can compete with Cowell. He is the best at what he does.
- I don't think you'll ever be happy about anything unless you've done it.
- We are all lucky to be here, we are lucky to be on stage and have millions of people watch us.
- We are constantly reminding them that they are in a competition. I had a word with all my contestants and I know Kelly Rowland had a word with hers. It's reality check time.
- I quite like being who I am.
- The trouble with the artists this year is they are all obsessed with Twitter and headlines. It feels like they are all getting a bit above themselves.
- I'm not a good time-off person. I'm awful on holiday. It comes from having that period when I didn't work. That really was the worst bit.
