This has resulted in a substantial and largely irreversible loss in the diversity of life on Earth.

- Sometimes I'm convinced that one day I'm going to draw the cartoon that offends everyone, and that'll be the end.
- I'm not into cartoons. That's the irony of it.
- A long time ago, I became aware that many of us have a tendency to lump nature into simplistic categories, such as what we consider beautiful or ugly, important or unimportant. As human a thing as that is to do, I think it often leads us to misunderstand the respective roles of life forms and their interconnectedness.

- A lot of people think I'm going to be like someone who's stepped out of one of his own cartoons. And maybe I am. But I sure have a hard time analyzing it.
- On Career Day in high school, you don't walk around looking for the cartoon guy.
- The daily calendar seemed, to me, like a kind of cartoon black hole, and you didn't have to be a rocket scientist to know that that couldn't be sustained indefinitely. That's why I pulled the plug on that one after the '02 edition. Kind of a preemptive strike.
