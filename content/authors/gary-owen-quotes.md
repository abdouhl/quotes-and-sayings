- Everything I do, I go to black people. If I have a problem at the airport, I'll go to the black ticket agent. I hope they notice me because I'll get better service. If I'm at a restaurant, I look for the black waiter. Rent-a-Car, give you the upgrade.
- I just want a big HBO special or a network or somebody willing to get behind my work and promote it. The most frustrating thing for me is to have this successful act that resonates across the country, and the network guys just don't get it. Everyone sees it except them. I want to leave a mark.
- Even if it's a white crowd, I tell my jokes for the four black people in the room, not the 100 whites.
- There's still people who think me being married to a sista is an act. What, you think I'd make that up for a persona?
- I always wonder if my kids will say they're mixed or black.
- There's no white comic that sells tickets to black people like me. They're going to get their hair done, get a new outfit, and come out to see a white dude.
