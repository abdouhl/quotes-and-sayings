- I understand that bureaucracy, hierarchy and managing politics is not easy.
- I know how irritating it is when a producer puts his hand in everything.
- Though I'm happy with the response to the film, I've been hearing the feedback that 'Yennai Arindhaal' has traces of my earlier films. It was meant to be like that. Since it's part of a trilogy, hence the reference to the other two films in the franchise.
- The only aspect I'd probably change in some of my films is the death of the heroine. I wish I'd kept some of them alive.
- I go straight into shooting with a script that's 80 per cent complete and I wait for my characters to grow on me before I finalise the climax.
- With Nani, what struck me was his confidence. It has been a revelation. Nani, the most confident actor and it is a pleasure to work with him. Will do a film with him anytime given a chance.
- All the women close to me - my mother, sister, wife and friends - are strong and independent.
- The industry doesn't usually say nice things about my work. My films take a while till they are accepted as good and I think 'Yennai Arindhaal' too will go through that phase.
- I do a film because at that particular moment, I want to make a film. It is my attempt at moving away from the ordinary.

- Yes, I am nervous before a film's release and withdraw into a shell.
- I firmly believe in copyrights and am put off by plagiarism.
- I don't read the reviews because it somewhere affects my work. If some critic doesn't like a movie, I can't keep his criticisms in mind the next time I am making a film. Even if someone writes a great review about my film, I don't want to be affected by it.
- If I know somebody's right about something I take it from them.
- Unless it's a song and something fancy, I would rather shoot on location.
- There are people who've told me cinema is a visual medium and you don't need to say so much. When I write the script, all these lines of what the characters are thinking are written. Once the film is shot and the lines are dubbed, I tone it down in postproduction if I feel it gets heavy.

- If I could talk in only one language for the rest of my life, it'd be Tamil.
- I may have got a little carried away and many critics found fault with some aspects of the film, but as a coming of age film of a character, 'Vaaranam Ayiram' worked with the audience.
- Whatever the script demands, I do.

Three days after its release, the producer called me and asked me to remove all of Jothika's scenes from the film. I told him; in that case, you can also remove my name from the director's slot.
