- Somehow in the 20th Century an idea has developed that music is an activity or skill which is not comprehensible to the man in the street. This is an arrogant assertion and not necessarily a true one.
- Music history has flowed under the bridges for many years.
- The academic area of new music or modern music festivals is not something which attracts me at all.
- I know that John Adams has had a very hard time directing French ensembles.
- Craft is part of the creative process.
- What was once underground is now coming to the surface.
- I've heard though that there is a younger generation of tonal French composers who are reacting with vigour.
- As I had collaborated with visual artists before whether on installations, on performance pieces, in the context of theatre works and as I had taught for a time in art colleges the idea of writing music in response to painting was not alien.

- People like Arvo Part would not have been taken seriously 20 years ago.

- It's rather like attending a university seminar where you are talking to a few gifted specialists who deliver a paper to an audience of their peers. That's one way of making music.
- I am writing something which I find satisfying and which I am prepared to put my name to as a composer.
- Still, American composers working in France have had a pretty hard time.
- Writing tonal music now, you are not writing into the 19th Century.
- There's another way of making music, by touching the lives and feelings of ordinary people.

- One thing I'm doing on the new Titanic recording is actually bringing in different acoustic spaces.
- I work very fast, keeping the ideas flowing but making sure they come out the way I intended.
- It makes sense to invest in new work. It's almost like having a research department in a scientific laboratory. You have to try things out. You'll make some bad mistakes. Some things will fail but at least you'll energise the organisation.
- Over the years I have tried to develop something which is technically assured.
