- I can swing widely in both directions of helpful or not.
- I spent the first 16 years of my life in Scotland. My whole family is there. It's in my blood and informs my sense of humour, my point of view, the people I choose to spend time with, everything.
- I sometimes get starstruck when I meet people who I didn't necessarily know what they look like, like directors or DPs, if I'm a huge fan of theirs.
- I just feel lucky to have had my training at Juilliard. Even though it is a 'classical' training programme, they also prepare you for all mediums. They don't teach specific techniques or subscribe to a specific school of thought about acting.
- 'Calamity Jane' inspired me to be a performer. I still want to be her.
- I fell in love with it after going there on holiday when I was 16: we went on one of those red bus tours, and it goes past Juilliard, and I was like, 'I want to go there'.
- I always get compared to looking like a silent movie star - though I don't know if that's a compliment, honestly.
- I would ask my mum to feed my dolls and make sure they were tucked in when I went to school.
- I had a ridiculously idyllic childhood. I think back and am like, 'Wow. I was so naive, in the best way.'
- I've always wanted to perform and act my whole life and to understand people more, so that's the only reason I've got to work with the people I've worked with.
- If you put me in a box, I'm a character actor. The thing that keeps popping up for me - it sounds really cliche - but I want to play something really physically challenging, something extremely demanding and strong.
- All of my characters, I feel, have some essence of who I am in them.
- There is magic in Scotland. It's country with a lot of pride and bravery. I feel lucky to have been born into that.
- Naivete is the real reason I applied to Juilliard. I wanted to study drama and not musical theater because I have a hard time dancing. I only applied there.
- I went to school at Juilliard, and most of our training there is the classics, and as much as I thrive in contemporary, weird, experimental work, I really am excited about finding a pioneer woman or something from a different era that I could really sink my teeth into.
- When I've known something is right, the actual doing of it is not scary. It's like being onstage or performing. After it and before it, there might be a lot of fear, but the act of it is never scary for me.
- I was never interested in 'making up' games when I was little. I wanted to create something real.
- I didn't think I was right for 'Cabaret'.
- I was a really girly girl when I was younger. I only wore pink until I was at least 12. Think of me in culottes with a Bagpuss T-shirt and frizzy hair. Oh, and I was a fat child. It was bad news.
- There's a misconception about wrestling, that it's really fake, but it's real, and you can really get hurt, even though a lot of it is performative.
- I could legitimately put someone in a headlock, for sure.
