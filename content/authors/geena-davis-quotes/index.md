- The motto of my institute has always been, 'If they can see it, they can be it.' And it's literally true. If we show something on-screen, it will change what happens in real life.
- Look at the number of cop shows and lawyer shows and forensics shows... I think there could be room for two quite different examinations of the same political office.

- I played this character twice in live action, and now I've become an animated character. It was actually fun to see myself drawn - I've never been a drawn character before.

- I was once up for a part, and the male star was also producing the movie. They were talking about meeting with him or having an audition with him, and then we get the message, 'He wants to have dinner with you.' I said, 'Is that the audition, or is it that he just wants to have dinner with me?'
- I have an elbow that bends the wrong way, and I'd do things like stand in an elevator and the doors would close, and I'd pretend that my arm had got caught in it, and then I'd scream, 'Ow, ow, put it back!'
- It's a fantasy that we could have a president who could actually make choices based on what's right, rather than having to weigh the political fallout. But that's sort of what we're showing. And you can dream.

- Rosie knows how to play ball. She's an athlete, for sure.
- When my friends and I would act out movies as kids, we'd play the guys' roles, since they had the most interesting things to do. Decades later, I can hardly believe my sons and daughter are seeing many of the same limited choices in current films.
- As an Independent, she has no party backing... Her being the first Independent president trumps the fact that she's a woman. It causes even more upheaval in Washington than her being female.
- I remember when 'A League of Their Own' was coming out in '92, when I was doing interviews, it seemed like every interviewer at some point would say, 'So... would you consider this a feminist movie?' People are worried that it's a taboo thing, so I took great relish in saying, 'Yes, I would. Write that, yes.'
- I haven't ever gone to any Mensa meetings.
- If you risk nothing, then you risk everything.
- This dapper little mouse that wore such cute clothes and said such interesting things, yeah. I thought it was a great idea to have a mouse like that in your family, so now I get to see what it was like.
- A woman as the leader of the Free World is an impossibility. Muslim countries won't talk to you.
- I've always looked up to him, even though he is shorter.

- If I go to hotels, they always say, 'Welcome back', even when I've never been there before.
- There are woefully few women CEOs in the world, but there can be lots of them in films.
- Film roles really did start to dry up when I got into my 40s.
- Having been in some roles that really resonated with women, I became hyper-aware of how women are represented in Hollywood.
- Women are half the population of the world, and yet there are so few female characters on-screen.
- I had one date in high school - that was it, and he didn't ask me out again, because I was taller than everybody. I was very gangly and awkward, and I wore weird clothes that I made.
- I was really lucky that I had an aunt who was very inspiring to me. She was different than anybody in my family on either side.
- I am completely obsessed with numbers and data. I have become a scientist in later life.

- It's really important for boys to see that girls take up half of the planet - which we do.
- Identifying with a character is one of the best parts of seeing a movie, but as women, we've had to train ourselves to experience the male journey.
- I get the feeling that characters are written female when they have to be, and all the other characters are male, and it doesn't occur to somebody that the lawyer, the best friend, the landlord, whoever, can be female.

- My parents are both from Vermont, very old-fashioned New England. We heated our house with wood my father chopped. My mom grew all of our food. We were very underexposed to everything.

- We're showing kids a world that is very scantily populated with women and female characters. They should see female characters taking up half the planet, which we do.
- Certainly 'Wonder Woman' needed to be made, and I'm so beyond thrilled with how it came out. I met Patty Jenkins, and I told her, 'I'm sure you're going to make a sequel, and if you need anybody Amazonian, there's always me. I'm available.'
