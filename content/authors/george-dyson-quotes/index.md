- When you click on a link, you are replicating the string of code that it links to. Replication of code sequences isn't life, any more than replication of nucleotide sequences is, but we know that it sometimes leads to life.
- Last time I checked, the digital universe was expanding at the rate of five trillion bits per second in storage and two trillion transistors per second on the processing side.
- I was a rebellious adolescent. It was the '60s. Everyone was rebellious. I hated high school.
- Digital organisms, while not necessarily any more alive than a phone book, are strings of code that replicate and evolve over time. Digital codes are strings of binary digits - bits.
- We could construct a machine that is more intelligent than we can understand. It's possible Google is that kind of thing already. It scales so fast.
- I don't know a single person who is not immersed in the digital universe. Even people who are strongly anti-technology are probably voicing that view on a Web site somewhere. Third-world villagers without electricity have cellphones.
- It doesn't cost anything to replicate code. So the companies that make code, that's why they've done so well. We take it for granted now, but why is it that code is free? It's because somebody built this self-replicating process.
- The unlimited replication of information is generally a public good.
- Alan Turing gave us a mathematical model of digital computing that has completely withstood the test of time. He gave us a very, very clear description that was truly prophetic.
- Wherever you grow up, you think of it as normal.
- History is one of the only fields where contributions by amateurs are taken seriously, providing you follow the rules and document your sources. In history, it's what you write, not what your credentials are.
- I have had a Twitter account since the very beginning but have never used it: I haven't tweeted anything, and I haven't followed anyone.
- If you spend time alone in the wilderness, you get very attuned to living things.
- I read the Drudge Report! And wander around Facebook sometimes!
