- All I wanted to do was to perform my music, so I never really thought about photo shoots or music video shoots or interviews. You can't anticipate those things - you just can't plan this as a job.
- I hate getting a McDonald's. I'm not a McDonald's person: you just feel crap afterwards.
- I've met other famous people, and what blows my mind is that when they get five minutes off, they're partying with other famous people. I wanna see my boys at home.
- Some people don't care why they are famous; they just want to be famous, and that makes my skin crawl a bit.
- Writing and playing songs is something that I've loved doing since the day I started. It's never been a chore; it's always a hobby. To be able to do that from day to day makes me believe I'm a very lucky person.
- The thing is, I'll always be a touring artist. It's what I am; that's what I love doing.
- When I was 15 or so, I made a conscious decision to try and sing with a big voice. Everybody I listened to had these big voices, and I wanted to try it. The blessing is that I could.
- The year 2014 was a big year for my taste buds. They really stepped up their game. Like, I got into red wine, coffee and sushi for the first time. Well done, George.
- I actually find it really hard to deal with people looking up to me or being interested in wanting a picture.
- My first instrument was bass, and the first thing that I remember learning to play that was better than a few notes was Fleetwood Mac's 'The Chain.' If you're the guy who penned that bass riff, then you should probably be in some sort of fantasy band.
- I don't know if I'm relentlessly cheerful... more consistently relaxed.
- You can't plan success with a creative field. So I enjoy it while it's here, and I know it won't be forever. Maybe one day I'll have to go back to flipping burgers, but for now I'm going to enjoy the cool things.
- Growing up, I listened to a lot of American singer/songwriters, so a lot of Tom Waits, Paul Simon - also Woody Guthrie and Bob Dylan. And bands like Vampire Weekend.
- When people say the words 'singer-songwriter,' I think they have an image in their heads of someone with an acoustic guitar who is a bit woe-is-me. I'd like to think that I'm not one of those. I'm quite a happy person.
- My first kiss was actually in a graveyard.
- I've always been someone who needs someone with them to poke and annoy. I'm useless at being by myself.
- I don't think I've ever worn anything other than black jeans and shirts. Quite simple, really, and quite casual.
- The music that I first fell in love with was American music, really. Nothing against British acts - I love them and will forever - but on the whole, it was the art of American storytelling in the kind of folk and blues lyrics that, if you scratch a little bit, there's a heartbreaking story there.
- I'm good in summer. My birthday is in summer. I don't like it when it's too hot, but, you know, blue skies, I think people genuinely loosen up a bit, and it's nicer.
- You don't want to start writing songs about how your Twitter followers are going up, because one day Twitter won't exist, and you'll feel like an idiot.
- When I was younger, I used to love the idea of writing songs and performing them live. But that was all I thought about. I didn't think about people getting to know my face.
- I'm not a big pet fan. I remember the school used to have a hamster, and you used to take it home for a week at a time. I did that. I probably got bored of it within a day.
- A lot of what I listened to growing up was blues, but also folk and indie music. So there's this marriage of songs that structurally are quite bluesy. Sound-wise, there's a lot of indie as well. But you can't really say I'm pop-blues, because that's insulting to blues. It just can't exist.
- I don't know how convincing I'd be as a soul cat. I'm a scrawny British kid.
- When I was growing up, my brother liked the Beatles, and I liked the Rolling Stones. I think if I were a girl, Keith would be the one I fancied.
