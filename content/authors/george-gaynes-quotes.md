- It should be easier to play opposite my wife.
- It depends on the generation and gender. The males usually go for 'Police Academy,' and the young women now in their late 20s or so go for 'Punky Brewster.' I am recognized quite frequently because they're still playing that stuff on television!
- I was an acting opera singer, and that's one of the reasons I left opera.
- My parents separated soon after I was born, so I left Helsinki when I was a year old. My mother took me to Paris and then other places throughout Western Europe.
- The two things an actor dreads most are children and dogs.
- For years, they cast me in these dumb straight roles of businessmen in three-piece suits.
- To build a character like Henry Warnimont required a few weeks and months of work. It turned out he was basically a very kind and generous man, which he covered up with his surface gruffness and surface bluster. And the kind of hopeless quality, that 'everything goes wrong' kind of thing.
- It's nice to be in demand.
