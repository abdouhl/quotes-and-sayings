- I like to keep busy.
- I like journalists.
- Honestly, I'm a shallow performer. I just go with the text and feel my way around it. There's not a whole lot of shaping.
- Once in a while it can be a bit disconcerting to be so recognisable.
- I really enjoy travel, I enjoy the U.K., I enjoy Scotland, Glasgow.
- I get called to do a lot of labors of love... independent films on very small budgets. If I have the time and if the project speaks to me, it's better than sitting around, right?
- Most of the holiday movies I enjoy, like 'It's a Wonderful Life,' don't really involve Santa.
- I not only get recognized - I get recognized from behind.
- I dream about 'Cheers.' Like when you go on a diet and you dream of pizza. I always think of those wonderful years. I loved working on it.
- I like New York.
