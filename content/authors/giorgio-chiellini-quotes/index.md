- I have always liked to play against the great ones.
- Have I ever hated anyone? Higuain - but he surprised me after getting to know him. No. 9s are selfish, they do a different job, but he has a generous, playful side. He's a demanding guy because you have to be pamper him, motivate him. He needs affection to feed the incredible potential he has.
