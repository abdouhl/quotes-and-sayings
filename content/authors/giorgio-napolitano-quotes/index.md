- If the constitutional process is not brought to a successful conclusion before the European elections, then the whole process might run out of steam.

- The country will also need 'new forms of social welfare' instead of its current system which is excessively centred on pensions.
- It is a responsibility we perceive from the entire international community to protect the stability of the single currency as well as the European frame work.
- We owe it to our children to give them a dignified and hopeful future.
- Now is the time to show maximum responsibility. It is not the time to pay off old scores nor for sterile partisan recriminations. It is time to re-establish a climate of calmness and mutual respect.

- It takes a lot of effort to win back credibility after having lost it so heavily.
- This unprecedented crisis, which is without doubt the worst since the second world war, is not over.
- We must resist the temptation of once again turning America into the traditional bogeyman of the left.
