- I'd like to be remembered for the way I went about doing my job.
- When I played, Old-Timers' Day was my favorite day of the whole season, because I got to share a locker with one of the great Yankees... It was an out-of-body experience.
- Hitters never showed me up, as hard as I threw. And I was pretty mean out on the mound.
- In my opinion, the best setup guys now have a tougher job than the closers. They pitch more innings, inherit more runners.
- I don't ever remember seeing a base runner who was all the way to third base run back across the mound. It was kind of a respectful thing.
