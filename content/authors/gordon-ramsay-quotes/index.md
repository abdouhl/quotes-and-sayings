- Cooking today is a young man's game, I don't give a bollocks what anyone says.
- I want my kids to see me as Dad, for God's sake, not a television personality.
- I've never been a hands-on dad. I'm not ashamed to admit it, but you can't run a restaurant and be home for tea at 4:30 and bath and change nappies.

- Kitchens are hard environments and they form incredibly strong characters.
- I am the most unselfish chef in Britain today.
- No one saw the recession coming.

- You know how arrogant the French are - extraordinary.
- When you're a chef, you graze. You never get a chance to sit down and eat. They don't actually sit down and eat before you cook. So when I finish work, the first thing I'll do, and especially when I'm in New York, I'll go for a run. And I'll run 10 or 15k on my - and I run to gain my appetite.
- I am a chef who happens to appear on the telly, that's it.

- I shoot from the hip.
- I grew up in a funny way.
- You don't come into cooking to get rich.
- When you cook under pressure you trade perfection.
- I still love football, though, and I think cooking is like football. It's not a job, it's a passion. When you become good at it, it's a dream job and financially you need never to worry. Ever.
- The pressure on young chefs today is far greater than ever before in terms of social skills, marketing skills, cooking skills, personality and, more importantly, delivering on the plate. So you need to be strong. Physically fit. So my chefs get weighed every time they come into the kitchen.
- I've had a lot of success; I've had failures, so I learn from the failure.
- Would I swap what I have achieved as a cook if I could have been as successful as a footballer? Definitely.
- I hid myself in food.
- I don't run restaurants that are out of control. We are about establishing phenomenal footholdings with talent.
- I mean, families are weird.
- I'm Gordon Ramsay, for goodness sake: people know I'm volatile.

- Swearing is industry language. For as long as we're alive it's not going to change. You've got to be boisterous to get results.
- I train my chefs completely different to anyone else. My young girls and guys, when they come to the kitchen, the first thing they get is a blindfold. They get blindfolded and they get sat down at the chef's table... Unless they can identify what they're tasting, they don't get to cook it.
- As a soccer player, I wanted an FA Cup winner's medal. As an actor you want an Oscar. As a chef it's three-Michelin's stars, there's no greater than that. So pushing yourself to the extreme creates a lot of pressure and a lot of excitement, and more importantly, it shows on the plate.
- Find what's hot, find what's just opened and then look for the worst review of the week. There is so much to learn from watching a restaurant getting absolutely panned and having a bad experience. Go and see it for yourself.
- I've got nothing to hide.
