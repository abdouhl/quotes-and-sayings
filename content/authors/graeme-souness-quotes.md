- It's very hard to retain the Premier League.
- The world is changing, football should definitely too.
- The stature of Liverpool means they want to win trophies.
- The strikers are the ones that normally go for big, big money because they're the ones who decide the games, nine times out of 10.
- You get rejection throughout your life and that shapes you eventually to what you become.
- Don't get me wrong, growing up in Edinburgh, I was all too familiar with the Hibs and Hearts rivalry. My father grew up in Leith - Hibee territory - just off of Easter Road on Albert Street.

- Mark Viduka, Nicolas Anelka and Michael Owen are all top strikers and the facts speak for themselves.

- I can earn a great deal more money by playing football outside Scotland than I could in Scotland, but I'd still like to be player-manager of Rangers one day.
- I get why people didn't like me, or don't like me, because I have an arrogance.
- I think I'm lucky in that I can park things. I don't dwell. I've got a selective memory. I only remember the good things. I don't know what a psychologist or a psychiatrist would say about that.
- I first learned what a rivalry really was at White Hart Lane.
- I've never courted popularity.
- When you talk about those Liverpool greats, they had players who won everything. Some great team men, great goalscorers, longevity.
- You can talk about systems until you're blue in the face but that's secondary - if you're closing down, if you're first to the ball, it doesn't really matter what system you've got.
- I joined Liverpool in 1978. I was the record signing between English clubs.
- I don't think anybody is looking at Mario Balotelli and thinking 'I'm going to work as hard as him.'
- I much prefer films based on fact rather than fictional stories.
- I worked out long ago that I wasn't cut out for management. My personality doesn't lend itself to the job, especially what it's become. By the time I stopped, the good times weren't compensating for the bad.
- Anfield is a unique place to play on European nights.
- Whatever happens will happen, that's the rollercoaster of life. What matters is how you handle the slumps.
- You can't look into a crystal ball but what you can say is if money is put on the table and you get half your signings right then you are going to be better next time around.

- You have to defend properly.
- Liverpool will always be the place I look back in terms of the place where I enjoyed playing, it was just unique.

- The one thing I learnt going to Italy was there's no real change in how the game should be played, but how players look after themselves.

- It's very easy for people to overlook how important a good goalkeeper is in a team.
- You've always got 20 per cent of a dressing room that won't be happy with their manager because they want to play more often. There are players who will have been moaning all year about not being in the team, but when they got their chance they failed to take it.
- I don't really socialise in the football world.

- What I miss about football is being in the dressing room. But do I miss three o'clock on a Saturday afternoon when matters are totally out of your hands? No, I don't. Do I miss placing my destiny in the hands of others? No, I don't. I loved it as a player. I liked it as a manager. But that's all come and gone.
- I think you find Liverpool fans are extremely passionate, as are Evertonians, but I think it goes to another level in Glasgow.
- If you're scoring two goals at Stamford Bridge, it tells you that you are a player.

- When I have an evening out I like to see big musicals where the whole audience is encouraged to giddy up out of the seat.
- It's very difficult, when you're in and out of the team as a player, to get any sort of rhythm.

- I found that being top put all the pressure on second place, not first. The focus is on the second-place team, who can't afford to slip up again.
- I was always - and I have no idea where it came from - a confident boy. And when I look at how I've lived my life that's how I've lived it.
- I came from a working class family. We lived in a prefab. We had nothing, but we had everything. I was out of the house at 12 to live with my grandmother, who was on her own, and I was expected to be the man about the house. At 15, I was living in digs in London after signing for Tottenham.
- Historically, Jose Mourinho is not a manager who chops and changes his team and he's not big on rotation.
- Some people can get there in three or four games, some need eight or nine, but after 11 games, if you've been playing regularly, you're match-fit.
- For a lot of lads, they grow up going to matches with fathers or mates. Those Saturday or Sundays where you head over to the stadium probably with a scarf on - knowing every word, every clap and every pause to the supporters' chants.

- You can't win any trophies unless you've got a top goalkeeper.
- If players cannot see what's going on in a game and adapt then they are no good and they will not win anything.
- To play as an anchor man you have to be extremely disciplined and a lot of the time you're attracted to the ball but can't go there because if you don't get there or it breaks down there is a hole.
- I'm not sure about Richarlison. I like him, I liked him when he was at Watford and he started well at Everton but would his preferred position be out on the left and cutting in? I'm not sure.
- I can remember Bob Paisley was never happy.
- If you are making mistakes at centre-back then inevitably that results in an effort on your goal and your goalkeeper has to make a save.
- People always have game plans to take care of Ronaldo, but very few people succeed in keeping him quiet for 90 minutes.
- Kante senses dangers and knows where the ball is going to be. He has that in his DNA. Paul Pogba has more in his DNA to be up there, create.
- A football club's board of directors' job is to attract and get the best football players and keep them at the football club.
- I was sold by Middlesbrough to Liverpool for a record fee between two English clubs and then won European Cups at Anfield, but I couldn't have been prepared for Rangers. I was a fan as a kid and attended a lot of European nights at Ibrox. I knew the club were big. But not how big.
- I was not satisfied at Rangers, not by a long way. I have hassles there, I had obstacles placed in front of me, and certain things never sat easily on my shoulders, and never will.
- If you came to my house you would not think an ex-footballer lived there. I've got nothing on the walls or the shelves from my time in the game.
- There's managers out there now who would love to have won a single trophy. The fact is the vast majority of them haven't. So I'm quite cool about what I did as a player and as a manager. Could I have done better, or differently? Of course. But that's all water that has flowed under the bridge; it doesn't cause me any sleepless nights.

- I accept that I sometimes overstepped the mark, but I can tell you that, off the pitch, I've never been an overly aggressive person.
- I think I speak for all the pundits when I say we are just giving an opinion. I am asked to give an opinion based on my experiences in football and based on what I see out on the pitch.
- I'm a great believer that you cannot have enough senior pros around your dressing room.
- Liverpool will always be a very special place to me.
- Man Utd have always been the glamour team, always been the team that attracted attention even when they were not winning things.
- We've got to keep the cost of watching football down. If that means players getting the same money for a few years rather than a 25 per cent increase every time, that's fine.
- I get a real buzz going into a stadium, a full house, the anticipation of how the game is going to pan out.
- I think if you're raising your foot high whether it's an overhead kick or not, you're risking a red card.
- No one's career is full of highs. Somewhere down the line you are going to get kicked where it hurts and it's how you deal with that.
- In my youth fashion was about moustaches and curly hair.

- The crowd are more understanding at Anfield than at any other football ground.
