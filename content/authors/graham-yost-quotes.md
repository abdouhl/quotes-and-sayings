- I do believe that we're in a true golden era of television, and I think it started with 'Hill Street.'
- My first real showbiz job was on a Nickelodeon show called 'Hey, Dude.' That was my first real paid scriptwriting job.
- I still run into people in the business who skip over any other credits I have and say, 'I loved 'Hey, Dude!' This was back in '88, '89, '90. It was a goofy show about kids working at a dude ranch in Arizona. We did 65 episodes; I wrote 13 of them. We didn't know what we were doing, but it was writers' boot camp. It was great.
- I had a great dad and we had a great relationship, but he's still a part of my life.
- Over the course of television's history, I think fans have done more to save shows and support them than ruin them.
- If you put people in a corner, you see what their character really is.
