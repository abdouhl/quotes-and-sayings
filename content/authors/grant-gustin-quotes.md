- I was at Elon University in North Carolina for two years pursuing my BFA. And after my sophomore year, I was cast in the Broadway Tour of 'West Side Story.' I just kind of - it always was my favorite show growing up.
- 'Glee' found me. I didn't really go looking for it.
- My 'Glee' experience taught me - to a certain degree - not to listen too much to fan backlash, at least to negative things. Once you have the job, you have the job, and you've got to do it.
- In college, I actually majored in Musical Theater. I was pursuing a BFA in Musical Theater.
- I don't run like any type of athlete.
- I'm challenged to races. Never a stranger. I've had a good friend of mine who, to be honest, is tiny and, like, should have assumed that I could have beat him, that I'm faster than him, and then crew members, two different crew members. I'm 3 and 0.
- I'm athletic but in a dancer way.
- I am not gay in real life.
- I've never been passionate about just music, I've never seen myself going into music in that sense. My love for music has always been connected to the stories told through music, which is why I was drawn to theater and why I think 'Glee' is so powerful.
- Some of my favorite artists are Jason Mraz, Eric Hutchinson, Ben Folds, Bruno Mars, Mumford and Sons, Maroon 5 - their vibe is slightly different from all the pop stuff on 'Glee,' although some do fall into that genre.
- I was about eight when I started tap dancing - against my own will. My mom wanted me to do it. She thought I would love it, and I didn't believe her. I turned out to be obsessed with it.
- My favorite actor that I look up to is Joseph Gordon-Levitt. His career is something I look up to, I just want to be that guy. He's always part of projects that have a lot of soul and that's what I want to do as an actor.
- I'm so tired of running.
- I love music more than anything; I don't think I would want to go into a strictly music field.
- I stopped doing any organized sports at 10 and started dancing.
- My childhood dream was always to be on Broadway. I wanted to end up in TV and film. It's kind of flipped, and I'm not mad about it, but my childhood dream is Broadway and I want to end up there.
- I was 'gay-bashed' when I was in school even though, you know, I'm not... I'm a straight guy that just happens to be what I do. So, it's easily relatable to me. It was awful. It's a hard time in a kid's life.
