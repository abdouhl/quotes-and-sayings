- Only one thing has to change for us to know happiness in our lives: where we focus our attention.
- Cancer opens many doors. One of the most important is your heart.
- Wellness seeks more than the absence of illness; it searches for new levels of excellence. Beyond any disease-free neutral point, wellness dedicates its efforts to our total well-being - in body, mind, and spirit.
- Wellness is not a 'medical fix' but a way of living - a lifestyle sensitive and responsive to all the dimensions of body, mind, and spirit, an approach to life we each design to achieve our highest potential for well-being now and forever.
- Although our inattention can contribute to our lack of total well-being, we also have the power to choose positive behaviors and responses. In that choice we change our every experience of life!
- When we are motivated by goals that have deep meaning, by dreams that need completion, by pure love that needs expressing, then we truly live.
- Let us be about setting high standards for life, love, creativity, and wisdom. If our expectations in these areas are low, we are not likely to experience wellness. Setting high standards makes every day and every decade worth looking forward to.
- The single overriding objective in wellness is creating constant personal renewal where we recognize and act on the truth that each day is a miraculous gift, and our job is to untie the ribbons. That's the Law of Esprit: living life with joy.
- We have thousands of patients and family members who are dealing with dual devastation, cancer and the hurricane.
- Wellness is the compete integration of body, mind, and spirit - the realization that everything we do, think, feel, and believe has an effect on our state of well-being.
- Focus on the journey, not the destination. Joy is found not in finishing an activity but in doing it.
