- I'm a two-time Olympian, but ever since I was a little girl, the Olympic dream has influenced me.
- I think everyone in snowboarding is close. We've become a big family. It's not a cutthroat sport. I'm competing against one of my best friends, and I think it's cool to be at the top of the half pipe, dropping in with your competitor but your best friend, too.
- Sometimes in life, when we really want something, we can approach it in a way that might actually be closing us off from achieving it.
- Mission makes athlete-specific products. I always use their sunscreen - it's an anti-sting formula, which is huge for me because it doesn't burn my eyes when I'm snowboarding in warmer temperatures.
- Being involved in sports, you think less about how your body looks and more how it performs.
- I partnered with Mission: it's a really cool company based on giving athletes what they need. I have my own signature lip balm because when I'm up on the hill, protecting your lips is so important.
- Climate change poses a far greater threat to the outdoor industry than even the privatization of the public lands.
- Everyone has different things they like in terms of board setup. The grind of the board and how it's waxed - you want to make sure that the speed of the board is right for the conditions of the halfpipe. And then there's the edges and the bevel of the edge.
- I love dried mangoes, walnuts, and goji berries. The mix provides iron, antioxidants, and omega-3s and really kicks up my energy.
- I think snowboarders have a unique experience when it comes to the Olympics because we have a pretty frequent competition circuit in addition to the games. So it's not a sport where your big moment is just once every four years.
- I have three brothers, and they were all snowboarders, and I always looked up to them. That's the reason I started snowboarding. I always wanted to be just as good as they were.
- The first few years I was competing, I'd ride so well in practice, then choke and fall in competition. Now I take a deep breath and say, 'Look at me. I'm outside. I'm doing what I love.' Still, nothing's matched the pressure I felt standing at the top of the halfpipe for the first time at the Olympics.
- Eliminate the energy vampires in your house. Connect all of your appliances to power strips and turn them off they're when not in use.
- Every year, I push myself to do something different - and push the boundaries a little bit more.
- Meditating, even for a little bit, is better than nothing.
- I run on the beach, surf, and bike.
- I work out hard; that way, I can eat whatever I want. If you have a hard time regulating your diet, pushing yourself at the gym will help you keep the pounds off.
- Growing up with brothers, I've always been a very competitive person and also very involved in sports. So when I was younger, whatever sport I was involved in, I wanted to go to the Olympics for that!
- Change can be uncomfortable and scary. But I believe change exists to teach us to appreciate and enjoy the right now.
- If you take minutes a day to take care of your mouth, the odds are you'll take the next steps needed to take care of your whole body, like exercising and eating healthy. It's a building block for other healthy habits.
- The programs I do with my trainer are amazing for overall strength and have a major focus on building my core. We do a lot of unique exercises that shake up the nervous system, which builds my balance and propreception. That's really important for my sport.
- It takes a village to earn a spot representing your country, and I know that every single person who helped me get to the Olympics was also touched by the dream. The web of inspiration is incredible. Because of this, I know that the core principles and spirit of what the Olympics stand for are worth protecting.
- Over the course of my 13-year career, I've had a lot of concussions, and yet, because I'm no longer competing or suffering from concussion symptoms, I felt like I was in the clear. The reality, though, is that I get concussions far more easily, and my symptoms last far longer than ever before.
- I'm a Midwestern girl; I was born in Toledo, Ohio, and grew up in Dayton until I was ten years old. Then my whole life changed.
- When I first started snowboarding, it was something that was only really done in the winter. Mount Hood in Oregon was the magical exception.
- It took me a long time to figure out how to deal with pressure.
- What snowboarding has always had and the Olympics has not touched is that spirit, that original spirit of creativity and athletes standing up and having a voice and being innovative. But I guess what the Olympics has done is provided a platform for that spirit, and that's what I see as being a really positive thing.
- Lots of times, people go to the mountains and feel like it's not cool to wear a beanie and goggles and neck gaiter. But you're so much more comfortable, and you're getting the protection you need.
- I learned a few years ago that balance is the key to a happy and successful life, and a huge part of achieving that balance is to instill rituals into your everyday life - a nutritious balanced diet, daily exercise, time for yourself through meditation, reading, journaling, yoga, daily reflection, and setting goals.
- I'm a competitor, and since I was 2 years old, I have always wanted to be the best at whatever I was doing.
- The Olympics have always been very special to me.
- Being at the top means never being satisfied with what you're comfortable with - comfortable means you've stopped pushing, and you're either going to get passed, or you already have been. But if you're constantly pushing yourself, then you're exposing yourself to falls and injuries.
- I've always had bigger legs and butt; it's just the way I'm built. Over time, I realized that they were blessings because that foundation - my legs and butt - is what helps me flip 12 feet above an icy halfpipe.
- It takes energy to get energy.
- I'm on the road a lot, but I eat healthy whenever I can with foods that don't contain pesticides.
- There will always be another email to get through; something to clean up, file, and organize; more errands to do. Which is why balance is so important. Life is a marathon, not a sprint.
- Meditation isn't necessarily this magical experience where we don't ever have thoughts.
- When I first started snowboarding, nobody trained off-hill. People weren't going to the gym and getting stronger. Snowboarding was more self-expression, like skateboarding. It was just something you went and did. It wasn't something you trained for.
- I think whenever you get out and do something different, like mountain biking or surfing, it just makes you more aware of your body and balance. For me, I've always loved anything that involved sports, so I've always just tried different things.

- It's okay to feel nervous before a competition because it means you care about doing well.

- I've had cumulative concussions and realized that's something you carry with you.
- When you feel the burn, that's when you know you're doing an exercise correctly. If you're doing 20 crunches, and you're not struggling, make an adjustment so they're harder to do. Don't cheat yourself. If it isn't burning, you're not getting stronger.

- If you don't snowboard a lot, then it's a good idea to go to the gym before you get up on those mountains to make for a better experience. Lots of core exercises and squats and lunges would help work the muscles you'll be using.

- I'm so grateful for all the experiences I've had; the life lessons I've learned along the way are just completely invaluable.

- You've made the time to go to the gym, so don't just go through the motions.

- When I win, I'm happy. When I lose, I'm also happy. I'm grateful for this life I have to live. It's a great life.
- Walk, skateboard, bike, car pool, or use mass transit more, and drive less.
- From day one, snowboarding led me down a totally different path, and it's that path that's kept me laughing and continually intrigued. I love the satisfaction at the end of the day of overcoming my fears, of spending all day outside working hard, and there's nothing better than the feeling of landing a new trick for the first time.
- I've landed on my shoulders a lot of times, and separated them and stretched the capsule. I've torn my ACL in my right knee; that took me out for an entire season.

- I think whenever you have any kind of injury or challenge, you just have to deal with it the best you can. You have to decide what's important to you and focus on getting back to where you want to be. And enjoy where you are and what your goals and dreams are and just give it 100 percent.

- For me, vision is just about the most important thing. So goggles play a huge role in my sport.
