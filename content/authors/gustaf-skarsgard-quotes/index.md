- I think it's so much fun to work with people who you like and love and are close to.
- When I find myself whining, and I'm like, 'God, it's wet,' there will always be one guy who never got into the heat tent, who didn't get past the coffee, and he's still there, and this guy is smiling. You know, I gotta get over myself.

- I expected to be doing basement theater in the suburbs of Stockholm.
- To any child, the first occupations that are presented to you are your parents'. I was appealed to my dad's occupation from the get-go.
- Always, when I get onto horseback, I'm kind of terrified of being up there.
- I like playing a variety of roles and characters, as it forces you to keep challenging yourself.
- I like to go back and forth between film and theater. When I do film, I miss theater and vice versa.
