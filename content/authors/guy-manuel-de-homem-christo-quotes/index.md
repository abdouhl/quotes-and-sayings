- We don't really worry about... what the audience might think. When we make a piece of music we don't worry whether they will like it or not; we are really trying to create the music that we want to listen to as individuals. We think it's the healthiest way.
- Looking at robots is not like looking at an idol. It's not a human being, so it's more like a mirror - the energy people send to the stage bounces back and everybody has a good time together rather than focusing on us.
- We consciously tend to listen to stuff that is further than what we do. We listen to Bach.
- I was too shy to be confronted by any kind of audience.
- When we began Daft Punk, by the albums we made, by the interviews we did and by every opportunity we had we tried to break all the boundaries between musical genres.
- Coming from 'Homework,' which was a really minimal album, 'Discovery' was much more difficult to perform on stage.
- I don't know EDM artists or the albums. At first I thought it was all just one guy, some DJ called EDM.
- We're not idols onstage. We're not the Rolling Stones.
- We've been able to create those personalities that are not anonymous that can somehow support exposure but in a fictional way.
- The 'Discovery' album was quite a successful record but we didn't tour after that.
- No, we never work with robots.
- We say that we are the guinea pigs of our experiment, we are doing things on ourselves, and if the audience can enjoy it as much as we do then that's great. If they don't, that's not a big deal.
- It's true that when I was younger and I first got interested in music, I used to read books about the Stones and the Beatles and how they listened to Muddy Waters and people like that when they were starting out, who are much less well known now than the Rolling Stones. The Stones really changed blues.
- You cannot separate your life and your music and your job; everything's linked.
- The robots are far more trippy and opening your imagination than my face or Thomas' face, and the way we live, which is not even a crazy celebrity lifestyle.
- All the music we've done with Daft Punk has got a wider, more diverse style; it has rock in it but it's really full of special electronic beats... It's not just rock so the music is different.
- The 70s and the 80s are the tastiest era for us.
- I loved 'Midnight Express' and how 'Chase' had this dark urge to it, like the 'Scarface' theme tune.
- Primal Scream's 'Screamadelica' was one of the pivotal records.
- Obviously, we love 'Tron.'
- I think people are really more excited to see the robots than they would be to see ourselves.
- The first song we ever performed, actually, was an instrumental, which says a lot about how shy we are.
- It's funny, we appear as robots from another world, but what we do, what the robots create, is really human after all.
- We are not really skilled musicians. I mean, I can play a little bit of guitar. Thomas can play piano.
- The 'Discovery' album is really complex and really rich and really full of instruments, different parts and stuff.
- For the second album, 'Discovery,' when we had to think about doing a live show I think we were not happy with the way it would look like and sound like. We were not happy coming onstage with just two or three samplers and a few drum machines, you know?
- It still amazes me that everyone is so crazy about what we are doing. Maybe I am just dreaming but people seem to really freak out at what we are doing. I don't know why.
- There's a feeling of despair for some, but that's not what we wanted. Because the whole movie is without dialogue, it's more a question than an answer. We wanted to make a question mark so people could project what they wanted onto 'Electroma' - some people see it as sad, some as happy. Everyone is different.
- We're like regular blokes.
- If you respect the audience and on stage you put on a disguise, that is part of the show.
- We work a lot.
- The star system, the idol, the cult of personality is not the only way to be in entertainment.
- Music is the core of what we are trying to do, and we try to find many other ideas around it.
- We're always looking for ground where we can experiment, where we can do something that's relevant but that hasn't been done before. Can it be in recorded music? Can it be in the field of a tour? These can take any kind of forms.
- I don't know if robots have personalities, but I think maybe we are special robots that are maybe human after all. We try to be a little bit human. Maybe we've managed to put a little bit of emotion.
- Thriller' reshaped sound. It reshaped everything.
- It's true that we come from the electronic scene in the '90s, but maybe just two years before that we were not listening to electronic music. We like music in general, and maybe we're more close to the rock energy or the rock aesthetic.
- We are huge Bach fans, and huge Glenn Gould fans.
- House music is not supposed to have so many rules.
- What's odd is that Romanthony and Todd Edwards are not big in the United States at all. Their music had a big effect on us.
- I don't listen to electronic music at home.
- We like to keep things as a surprise. It's always better like that.
- We wanted to draw a line between public life and private life.
- We experimented with stuff that some might find crazy, but we wanted to widen and make the spectrums of influence much larger, because house and electronic music is about freedom.
- With American blockbuster cinema, everything is very fast, there's a lot of action and narration.
- You feel it's not real when people are, like, petting your back all the time.
- The big difference with 'Random Access Memories' and maybe 'Tron' is that we decided to share the experience of making music with a bigger team.
- The magic - we can try to capture the magic - the music that comes out of the speakers. That sparkle of magic that we can get sometimes is just what we are looking for and if it works while we're in the studio the two of us, then we think that maybe we can share it with an audience. And it's been the case from the beginning.
- Since we began Daft Punk we go from surprise to surprise.
- We've never been, really, singers or performers. We are a little bit but we are not like Mick Jagger or Keith Richards or anyone like that.
- You can have energy in music and dance to it but still have soul.
- Every album we've done is tightly linked with our lives.
- When we have a good work dynamic we don't need to ask too many questions of each other.
- Technically it was really hard to render the right way the second album on stage.
- We didn't understand why it should be obligatory to be on the covers of magazines as yourself when you are making music and are not a showman.
- Any time an English band came to Paris we went to the concert. All the French crowds were really bad and really blase. We were the only ones wanting to have fun.
- We're not performers, we're not models - it would not be enjoyable for humanity to see our features, but the robots are exciting to people.
- Whether it's making music or directing a video, whatever we do we do it quickly.
- From the beginning, with our first album, we wanted to make the music that maybe was lacking around us - the music that we wanted to hear.
- It's good for people not to have a narrow mind. Good music is good music.
- There's this idea that robots are not human, so they are cold,' he said. 'But it's not really the case. They can be anything you want them to be.
- When we come on stage as robots, it's really powerful.
- EDM is energy only. It lacks depth.
- In France, disco was an artistic progression that might not have had the same social stakes. Also, the language barriers - like with hip-hop, in France, the focus is more on the personality, of the flow of the music, rather than the lyrics themselves.
- Going to the blackboard at school was the worst torture.
