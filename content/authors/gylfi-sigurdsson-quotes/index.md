- As long as I'm playing I'm happy.
- When I was young, all I wanted to do was play football.
- I just wanted to play football and didn't get the chance in Germany in my second season there.
- We are a small nation that nobody expects anything of.
- It's nice to have pressure. It keeps you going and keeps you working hard but if you think too much about it then it could get into your head, and you play your best football when you're enjoying yourself and if you're relaxed - so that's what I'll try to do.
- Beckham and Frank Lampard were the ones that I particularly liked watching, and with Lampard scoring so many goals from midfield it was hard not to look up to him.

- You can understand why it is difficult for the players who have long-term injuries when they have to watch the boys going out training every day.
- Things just seem easier when you build up a bit of a points gap.
- It is good for the morale of the team when you see top players being brought in.
- Tottenham have always played fantastic football. I remember watching them many years ago when I was younger, and they'd concede three but they'd score four.
- It's a good feeling when you deliver under a lot of pressure.
- I'm not sure if it's easier to play against teams who try to play football against you rather than sit back.

- I'd spent three and a half years at Swansea, played my first Premier League game there.
- I'm not going to lie, living in London is incredible. You've got so much going on.
- When someone gets injured someone has to step up and fill his place.
- Bony is probably physically stronger than Kane but I think Harry Kane comes a little bit deeper to pick up the ball some times.
- Of course, as a young boy it was always my dream to either go to the Premier League or the Bundesliga.
- As a player you want to play every game that you can and play as many minutes as you can.
- Playing for Iceland, you always find the stats are against you, so I never pay too much attention to them.
- My interest in football in England started very young. The Premier League was on TV and my dad used to watch it so naturally I would be sat with him on a Saturday or a Sunday watching the football with him.
- I do not regret it and I really enjoyed my time at Spurs. I improved a lot playing with big players.
- I probably played too much on the left for my liking - I'm not that kind of player who is going to get the ball and run past the full-back. Of course if it happens, you've got to do a job for the team, and no problem. But I feel better - and think you get more out of me - playing me through the middle.
- I played on frozen pitches, on snow. I had only a couple of years indoor before I went to England.
- As long as I'm playing, I'm very happy.
- Like every other player, I want to play.
- For me, I think the Champions League is the biggest trophy, but playing for your country in the World Cup... it's hard to choose.

- My dad played in Iceland and I think went over to Sweden for a couple of years.
- My grandad was a fisherman and my dad was a fisherman.
- My dad and my brother took me over to England a few times to train with various clubs. My brother basically ended up sending a CD to a few clubs of me playing football. That seems like a long time ago now, but it ended up signing for Reading.
- I eat healthy and train.
- Swansea is totally different. The people here are so friendly, different to London where everyone is in a rush.
- Joining the family business was always Plan B or Plan C.
- Of course I want to play my way into the starting line-up, that's what every player wants to do.
- The things I love are scoring goals and getting in the box, getting on the end of crosses and taking up positions where the ball might fall to you.
- If you get a few successive games you are going to get in to your stride and once you start playing more you get more confidence and then you can push on.
- I spent a lot of time with Swansea City and it will always be a club that means a lot to me, and it still does.

- With young players you never know how quickly they're going adapt.
- Personally 2016 has been a very good year.
- I always played football as a kid and never really thought about anything else. I always wanted to do that.
