- My parents have been with me every step of the way.
- I definitely I prefer to sing in the car. I don't sing in the shower, maybe its because that's the one time I don't need to talk to anyone so I should just shut up, otherwise I'm just, you know, jibber jabber.
- I'd rather have people really be able to step back and get their money's worth and look at me as a true artist than somebody who is just regurgitating other material.
- Music continues to remind me that its boundaries are limitless.
- Music is not just a part of my everday life, I'm surrounded by it every minute.

- First thing I did when I found out I made it into the top 13 is I tried not to faint and you know, I took it all in and I really looked at the crowd and said a big 'thank you'.

- My folks have played everything from rock, disco, pop, funk, and blues. My dad has always brought and played different genres like jazz, classical, and Latin. With all this in my pocket, I feel I have a taste of everything for my influences.
- If my life had to be a song I would name it, 'Live every day like its your best day ever', because it pretty much is.

- My parents have basically just taught me the rules of the stage and everything since I was eight.
- If there's a pool I love to hangout there and layout and get some sun. If I can ever find a second to get some sun, some Vitamin D, I will do so.
- It's always been a dream of mine to get somewhere and to have my mom and dad with me up there.
- Performing on stage is what I've done since I was a kid and it's where the passion that has started from the very beginning for me, and that's what I'm going to enjoy.
- If I were to categorize what I sing, I have many different influences, and a lot of them are from back in time.
