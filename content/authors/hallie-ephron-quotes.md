- When something happens far back in the past, people often can't recall exact details. Blame depends upon point of view. There may be a villain, but reality is frustrating because it's often ambiguous.
- I was an outsider, never quite part of what was going on, always looking in. It turned out to be great preparation for writing fiction.
- Even though I got a late start, first publishing an essay when I was 50 years old, I've since written eight suspense novels.
- As we got older, we grew comfortable in roles that met our parents' expectations. Nora was the smart one. Delia, the comedian. I was the pretty, obedient one. And Amy was the adventurous mischief-maker.
- I haven't given any thought to collaborating with my sisters. It would be great fun. My daughter Molly is a wonderful writer - someday I'd love to collaborate with her.
- For me, a good YA novel is the best kind of comfort food.
- I'm someone who sits at a computer eight hours a day, and I look in that pinhole camera at the top of my screen and think, 'Someone could be watching me.'
- I'm sharpest early, and though I can rewrite any time, day or night, I'm useless after noon when it comes to writing first draft.
- Our house was awash in books, and my mother doled out her favorites like they were special treats - which they were.
- I'd long wanted to write about that moment when a woman steps off the career track to have her first child. For me, that was a scary time.

- Phoebe Wolkind Ephron cracked wise like Dorothy Parker and looked like Katharine Hepburn.

- Outlining is like putting on training wheels. It gives me the courage to write, but we always go off the outline.
- Everyone thinks when they start writing that they can't do it. I was lucky. My sister Delia was the most important person in terms of encouraging me.
- The book that made a lasting impression was the one my mother gave each of us when she decided we were ready for our first 'adult novel,' Lucy Maud Montgomery's 'The Blue Castle.'
- My rule of writing is that no one can do what you can do, so jealousy or competitiveness are pointless. I am always happy when one of my sisters has a book published that I get to read.
- I don't think anybody in my family meant there to be any pressure for me to write. But our parents were incredibly verbal and wrote for a living. The house was full of books, and we all grew up steeped in language. I mean, our mother recited poetry at the dinner table.
