- There is just no evidence of rampant voter fraud when it comes to mail-in ballots.
- I made a point to have 'mini-adventures' on the road. In Tucson, that meant swinging by a massive airplane graveyard. A quick detour through the Grand Tetons was a Wyoming highlight. We stopped for cheese in Wisconsin and barbecue in South Carolina.
- Television is an intimately personal medium, especially with so many people watching on their phones or laptops. Style pressure comes with the territory.
- It's a little stressful to put down your phone in a little cubby and spend an hour with a barre teacher, but like, you know that it's good for you.

- When you're coming off a flight, skip the restroom by the gates and head to the one in baggage claim, which is always cleaner - and there's never a line.
- You never want anything to distract from the message you're sharing with the audience. That means even after an all-nighter in the car or a live shot after two connecting flights, you have to sound and seem fresh. You want people focused on what you're saying, not how you look.
- Instead of simply stopping at acknowledging gratitude for, say, your supportive partner, it takes you a step further to think about the reasons why you're grateful - and what that says about where you are on your journey. I've found it really helps tap into what's most important to me.
- Kristen Welker and Kelly O'Donnell, and producers Alicia Jennings and Stacey Klein, are all veterans of presidential foreign trips. Ali Vitali, who covered the Trump campaign, brings a different perspective: She flew nearly every leg of the president's 2016 campaign. It's a great mix of experiences and one hell of a fun group.

- Sleep deprivation can be a serious problem in romantic relationships.
- Every major press organization works out of its own little space in the White House. Picture a mini cruise-ship cabin, or a row of four seats on an airplane: that's about all the space we have. You spend hundreds of hours inches away from your colleagues.
- The 'Women on 20s' movement hopes to put pressure on President Obama to change U.S. currency, though it's ultimately up to the Treasury Secretary Jack Lew to make the call.
- My personal experience has felt unique in that I'm juggling the already-intensive demands of network coverage of the White House alongside my daily MSNBC show.
- It can be really tough to find decent veggies when you're racking up highway miles or bouncing from airport to airport.
- Marrying video, sound, and words can create incredibly compelling storytelling, and when you add the political piece, you get a special combination: stories directly impacting the democratic process. It's a unique responsibility and one I'm passionate about.
- My MSNBC show team is just phenomenal.
- All eyes turned to the United States after countries around the world banned the Boeing 737 Max 8 and 9 following the deadly plane crash in Ethiopia. But President Donald Trump didn't follow suit at first, even as the pressure built.
- You never know when you might get scrambled to an impromptu press conference.
- I'm considering getting an Apple Watch just so I can sneak glances to make sure I'm not missing anything during class.

- A great pair of jeans works anywhere from a campaign rally to a fancy fundraiser.
- I covered the 2016 campaign and covered that in a very traditional way. I was on the road, I want to say, like 340 days out of the year.
- I'm really lucky to have colleagues in the White House press corps who are both amazing mothers and amazing journalists. Their collective wisdom has proven invaluable in my own journey.
- Our team at NBC's White House Unit always has a list of questions prepped and ready to go - for the president, for his aides, or for whoever else we're able to corner.
- Food on the road can be a hit-or-miss deal.
