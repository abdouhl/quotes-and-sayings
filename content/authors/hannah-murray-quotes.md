- One of the hardest things to do in acting is to stop thinking about yourself and stop being self-conscious.
- Turns out you have a really fun time if you go to work every day and focus on being silly and funny and happy!
- You can tell when people think they're a little bit special, and it's quite fun to laugh at them, and I think it's good to laugh at them, because then you can deflate their egos a bit.
- I really loved animals when I was little - my friend and I had an imaginary vet's office; we would mime doing surgery on animals. We treated more injuries than illnesses - fixing with a baby bear with a broken leg, removing a tumor. Of course, our surgeries would take about five seconds; that's how good we were.
- Was I in a nativity play? I think I was an angel; I was a very blonde child, so I tended to get typecast. I have a vague memory of wearing wings.
- I've always loved musical films; I find them really thrilling and exciting; it was part of what made me want to be an actress, that feeling of being really transported.
- 'Skins' is about a group of teenagers in Bristol, and it's all about what they get up to and all the different things they do. I think it's a good show because it's come from a very real place, and there's a lot of young people involved in the writing.
- I wonder if I maybe have a natural floatiness that comes through in everyone I play.
- No one in my family is in entertainment. They thought acting was a fun hobby, and when I got a degree, I'd settle down.
- I can't think of any shows I've watched about teenagers that has the same spirit that 'Skins' has, the same honesty about it.
- I really hate being recognised. I'm quite a shy person, and I'm not very good at talking to strangers. So when people come up to me in the street, I just find it quite awkward. I don't really know what to say to them.
- I really like all of the characters in 'The Secret History' by Donna Tartt, especially Camilla, the one girl. I find her fascinating.
- I'm not a trained singer at all. I've auditioned on occasion for proper musical theatre-type stuff, but I can't read music, and I wasn't particularly good at it.
- I don't think there's any show comparable to 'Game of Thrones' in terms of the way it does the fantasy element to such a high standard: everything is created with so much care and detail. You really feel like you are transported into this entirely other fictional place.
- Stuart Murdoch is a really special human being - really creative, but also really kind and gentle.
- Do people ever ask me to say 'Wow?' Never in interviews, but a few times on the street. I don't do it. I try to get away from them as quickly as possible and explain that I'm not a performing seal.
- I can remember on the first day on 'Chatroom,' it was just one scene for the whole day, which was a really nice luxury to have.
- On 'Chatroom,' everyone was so nice, and we had a really great time together; we were around the same age and got on really well.
- There are so many female roles - particularly for young women - that are just somebody's girlfriend or somebody's daughter, or that are accessories to the main story rather than being three-dimensional characters.
- I never, never lend any of my own clothes for parts any more because you lose your clothes; they become the characters' clothes, and you can never wear them again.
- I really like singing, although I'm embarrassed about doing it.
- Cambridge is really understanding and helpful, so that's been good, and it's just a case of trying to get stuff done when I am there and just being efficient with managing my time.
