- When I have an argument with someone, even with someone I am not very close with, I can't sleep at night thinking about it. It's terrible.

- Fame is easy to acquire; impact is much more difficult.
- I meet so many that think population growth is a major problem in regard to climate change. But the number of children born per year in the world has stopped growing since 1990. The total number of children below 15 years of age in the world are now relatively stable around 2 billion.
- There's about one sword-swallower per 2 to 4 million persons in each country.

- Data allow your political judgments to be based on fact, to the extent that numbers describe realities.
- The shining star in the world is Shanghai. That's what CEOs from big companies say - 'if I want mathematical analytical work done, it's done in China.'

- Beyond 2050 the world population may start to decrease if women across the world will have, on average, less than 2 children. But that decrease will be slow.
