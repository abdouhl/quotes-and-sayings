- I am a Democrat. But I am an independent Democrat.
- Public service is a part of who I am, having grown up in a family of politicians.

- Lawmakers misrepresent the facts when they call the manufacturing deduction known as Section 199 - passed by Congress in 2004 to spur domestic job growth - a 'subsidy' for oil and gas firms. The truth is that all U.S. manufacturers, from software producers to filmmakers and coffee roasters, are eligible for this deduction.

- I'm a capitalist. I believe that people take risk, and there are rewards if they do well; they should lose if they don't.

I think we ought to reform long-term entitlement spending in the country, but you can't out of one side of your mouth say, 'Yes, we're for tax cuts, we're for spending discipline, and we're for bringing down the debt.'
- As America's head coach, President Obama needs to make some big and smart adjustments to jump-start economic growth and business investment, stimulate job creation, and get wages up for ordinary Americans.

I never strayed from them.

My banking work has taken me out to Palo Alto, what is commonly called Silicon Valley. And you sense out there is always a forward-looking outlook. And New York City.
- I don't think it's a great leap to go from civil unions to gay marriage - I may be in the minority in believing that.
- The idea is a straightforward one. We provide an account for every newborn in America, a $500 account.
- I think if you socialize, dine with, spend time with known terrorists that are on the list of those who want to do harm to America, you put yourself in peril. I don't dine, socialize or spend time with people who are on the terrorist lists.
