It's harder to be an educated and informed citizen.

Lots of bumps and injuries along the way.
- I don't do celebrity endorsements. My work with Conservation International is a good use of whatever celebrity I might have to draw attention to important problems. I have the same responsibility as everyone to reduce consumption and to teach children to respect the environment.
- I get mad when people call me an action movie star. Indiana Jones is an adventure film, a comic book, a fantasy.

And I think it would be very interesting to revisit the character.

- We all have big changes in our lives that are more or less a second chance.
