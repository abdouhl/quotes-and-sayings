- I'm a Texas girl.
- I mainly like to do singer/songwriter kind of stuff.
- I watched 'I Love the '80s' on VH1.
- I would love for 'The Goldbergs' to continue for as long as we can possibly let it happen, because it's my favorite thing I've ever done, and I can't imagine my life without it.
- Every time I tried writing my own songs, they would come out very country. I couldn't fight it, and the more I listened to country music, the more I loved it, and it just became very natural.
- I am a super social person. I'm an only child, so I thrive on social settings and being around my friends because I make them my siblings. When I'm not acting or singing or working on anything, I am making new relationships with people because, to me, my friendships are very important.
- I definitely make time for music.
- Music has always been my first love, so making music happen is a big priority of mine.
- I really don't understand jelly shoes - those see-through, glittery, sandal-type things that girls wear. I cannot, for the life of me, understand why they were ever popular.
- Whenever you go into an audition, you have to be as prepared as possible.
- I am a singer first and foremost. I was lucky enough to have a manager, when I was 15, who knew the heads of a lot of record labels at the time.
- Sitcoms always made the most sense to me. I grew up watching them every day with my dad. Every Monday, Tuesday night, we would be sitting in front of the television watching any kind of sitcom. I connect with that more, but I love to do whatever kind of role.
- I can't stand jelly shoes. They're ugly and not comfortable.
- I love Whitney Houston. I absolutely love her song, 'I Wanna Dance With Somebody.'
