- Like most dancers, I love lip stains! We hate gloss because hair gets stuck in it.
- Implants were something I thought I wanted when I was younger, and now I don't. It was hard being active with them, because my chest was always sore. It hurt a lot, and I didn't like always being in pain, so they had to go!
- You don't want to be too cool. But you don't want to be too dorky. Still, I find it so much better to see a guy at a club being a dork, and having fun, than trying to be sexy.
- Dancing was my sport when I was younger. So I chose that over everything. And then, I just had to keep going because it became a competitive thing. But I'm not trying to impress anyone anymore. Dancing is more like my art, now.
- There were ten dancers - four guys and six girls - including me, on the Beyonce tour. Sometimes we would go out with her, to events. She was really normal - just like everybody else!
- I go through different phases and change my mind about my style all the time. In the winter, I wanted to wear jeans and pumps and black and leather all the time. Right now, I want to wear long skirts and belts, with my hair in a ponytail. It changes all the time!
- You know what's really hot? Pop-and-locking, ticking. The moonwalk. Tricks like that.
- I am thrilled FLIRT! tapped into me to be their new Style Ambassador. I love FLIRT! products because they help me express my own personal style - especially when I want to stand out on set or in the crowd. What could be more fun than getting to play with makeup and fragrance and tell people all about it!
- I'm pretty gutsy. Dancers don't think about things; they just do them.
- The simplest way to do something cool is the cross-turn. Like in the '80s - Michael Jackson did it. You jump and cross your legs together at the same time, and then spin out of it. That's it.
- My dad passed away before my freshman year, and it altered how I thought. I was depressed - I didn't hang out with my friends. I worked through it by dancing.
- I love looking in the mirror and feeling good about what I see.
- I had a serious boyfriend in high school, but we would take breaks in between. You shouldn't always have a boyfriend!
- Beyonce was just always full-out. She's like a beast. So you learn that no matter how you feel, just do it. Just like Nike: 'Just Do It.'
- I love to wear red lipstick a lot, even in the daytime.
- I guess because I'm so young, I m not sure of what lies ahead for me. I'm more into going the route of producing and directing. I just made a little short film. I'm more excited about going the route of doing a Drew Barrymore or... what's the one from 'Star Wars?'
- I carry one black mascara and one brown.
- Me and my roommate wrote and directed a little short comedy called 'The Elevator.'
- I try to eat how your mother wanted you to eat when you were young.
- I can't live without my dark plum eyeliner. I use liquid because it's easier on my eyes.
- I put on lip balm first thing in the morning and always use it before I swipe on my red lipstick.
- I've wanted to perform my entire life. I found a paper I wrote in kindergarten class about what I wanted to be when I grew up - and I wrote 'a famous singer!'
- I want to make everybody laugh.
- Flirt!'s mascara is insane - I don't need false lashes when I wear it.
