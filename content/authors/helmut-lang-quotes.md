- I have been asked to collaborate with fashion houses using my artwork, which I will probably do.
- I have always been interested in materials and in transforming them.
- I don't think I'm the one that invented glamour at all.
- When you're young, you're fearless and more creative, more of an outsider.
- I've never been interested in the event when I'm the center of attention.
- I'm really bad at describing my own life.
- Once I'm committed, I'm unafraid of the outcome.
- I was never so directly inspired by fashion. It always came from somewhere else.
- I have a lot of insecurities, but you learn from your failures.
- If you really have your own identity you'll keep on doing what you think is really right for you, and you'll also understand the next step you want to take.
- To grow up under really simple circumstances, and to understand that certain things were ornamental... that made an impression on me as a child and is something I use.
- In the fashion world if you're successful, everyone loves you, and you have available every service. It's hard to walk away, except it wasn't hard for me. I had my mind completely made up.
- I think the history and the past we have is just an energy we've built up to do what we do now.
- In the end, I do think it's insulting to men and women to insist that they fit a certain profile. I never understood that.
- If something is good, it doesn't go out of style every six months. The fashion wheel of today doesn't have to go as quickly as it was pushed in the 80's.
- The media is looking every season for a designer to tell a story. I have a long story I have to tell, continuing fluently year after year.
