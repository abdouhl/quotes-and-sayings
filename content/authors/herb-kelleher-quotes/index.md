- You can have parties without spending enormous sums of money.
- Your employees come first. And if you treat your employees right, guess what? Your customers come back, and that makes your shareholders happy. Start with employees and the rest follows from that.

- What's important is that a customer should get off the airplane feeling, 'I didn't just get from A to B. I had one of the most pleasant experiences I ever had, and I'll be back for that reason.'
- The clear, unmistakable sign of a bureaucrat is somebody who worries about whether he has a window.

We put all their names on the outside of the overhead bins.
- My suggestion is that if you need someone outside your company to prepare a mission statement for you, then you really don't know what your mission is, and you probably don't have one.
