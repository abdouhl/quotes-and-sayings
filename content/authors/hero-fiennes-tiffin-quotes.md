- There are lots of professions where your social following is key now. But chasing followers is strange to me. I'd rather focus on the work.
- I never actually got noticed on the street for 'Harry Potter.' I did it at such a young age, when I was going through puberty and changing up my hair and how I looked.
- I've always wanted to demonstrate a variety of different roles when I act and do different projects and not ever do one of the same.
- I feel like I don't have much of a preference. With TV, it's just a longer process, so you need to be more sure that you really want to be involved in it for a longer time than you would be with film.
- I definitely devote so much more time to acting, but since it only takes a day or two to shoot and get pictures out - whereas for acting, you do an audition, or loads, and you might not get any of them - so I did the modeling stuff because, obviously, if I have the opportunity, I'm going to take it.
- If you're good, you'll get work. And if I've got food in my fridge and clothes on my back, I'll be happy.
- My uncles are always busy away acting, so I barely even see them much at all, but I always know that they are so supportive. Anytime I do see them, they always check up on it and make sure everything's okay and let me know that they're there for me.
- I'd love to be involved in the process of adapting a book to a script, but that's simply not my job.
- Modeling stuff is cool - obviously you get to travel and wear cool clothes, take cool pictures, meet cool people - but for me, acting is a lot more creatively fulfilling, so I've always put it first.
- In the small amount of modeling work I've done, I'm always told that I never smile.
