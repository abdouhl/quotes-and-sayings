- My sister loved country music. My mother loved Spanish music. And my dad was into big band music and jazz.
- I think Liv Tyler's a nice-looking girl. Seems sweet.
- I've always loved music. I grew up with older brothers and sisters who were into music, played The Beatles and the Rolling Stones and Aretha Franklin.

- I think a lot of our songs are good.
