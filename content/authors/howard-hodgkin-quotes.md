- Collecting has been my great extravagance. It's a way of being. I collect for the same reason that I eat too much-I'm one of nature's shoppers.
- My language is what I use, and if I lost that, I wouldn't be able to say anything.
- A collection makes its own demands. Many artists have been collectors. I think of it rather as an illness. I felt it was using up too much energy.
- I look at my pictures, and I think, 'Well, how did I do that?'
- I'm very envious of the few artists who are any good and still do portraits.
- Matisse was very clear about saying that you have to blow your own trumpet and explain yourself, which I think has been slightly forgotten.
- In the United States there has been a kind of a structure in the Modern art world. The New York School was nearly a coherent thing-for a minute.
- I don't really have a historical overview of my work at all. I'm not an art historian. I don't see that there's this period and that period.
- I once was interviewed and got so exasperated that I said, 'What do you want, a shopping list?' They kept asking, 'What's in this picture?'
- The picture surface recedes just as much in the 20th century as it did in the 15th. The techniques of making pictures have hardly changed.
- I find old copies of National Gallery catalogues, which are written in the dryest possible prose, infinitely soothing.
- In England, it's thought to be morally suspect to worry about what your surroundings look like.
- I hate painting.
- I am happy for people to talk about my pictures, but I wish devoutly that I was not expected to talk about them myself.
- I want my pictures to be things. I want them to be made up of marks that are physically and individually self-sufficient.
- My friends tend to be writers. I think writers and painters are really all the same-we just sit in our rooms.
- I am isolated as an artist, not as a person.
- You keep on balancing and balancing and balancing until the picture wins, because then the subject's turned into the picture.
- A painting is finished when the subject comes back, when what has caused the painting to be made comes back as an object.
- I'm vulnerable to criticism. Any artist is, because you work alone in your studio and, until recently, critics were the only way you'd get any feedback.
- When I finish a painting, it usually looks as surprising to me as to anyone else.
- I think that words are often extraneous to what I do.
- I don't think you can lightly paint a picture. It's an activity I take very seriously.
- I fell through a crack for years. Historically, I am a nothing because I fit in no category. I can only be me.
- I think words come between the spectator and the picture.
- I don't look at the work of my contemporaries very much; I tend to look at pictures by dead artists. It's much easier to get near their paintings.
