- I sometimes talk about the making of a poem within the poem.
- Robert Frost had always said you mustn't think of the last line first, or it's only a fake poem, not a real one. I'm inclined to agree.
- It may be said that poems are in one way like icebergs: only about a third of their bulk appears above the surface of the page.
- Occasionally a student writer comes up with something really beautiful and moving, and you won't know for years if it was an accident or the first burst of something wonderful.
- When you write it doesn't occur to you that somebody could think different from what you do.
- A chronicle is very different from history proper.
- When Robert Frost was alive, I was known as the other new England poet, which is to be barely known at all.
- Nothing in the universe can travel at the speed of light, they say, forgetful of the shadow's speed.
- Language is remarkable, except under the extreme constraints of mathematics and logic, it never can talk only about what it's supposed to talk about but is always spreading around.
- Once in awhile you have a thought, and you rhyme it.
- For a Jewish Puritan of the middle class, the novel is serious, the novel is work, the novel is conscientious application why, the novel is practically the retail business all over again.
- Write what you know. That should leave you with a lot of free time.
- Mostly the thought and the verse come inseparably. In my poem Poetics, it's as close as I come to telling how I do it.

- I would talk in iambic pentameter if it were easier.
- A lot happens by accident in poetry.
- I think there was a revolution in poetry, associated chiefly with Eliot and Pound; but maybe it is of the nature of revolutions or of the nature of history that their innovations should later come to look trivial or indistinguishable from technical tricks.
- I like all my children, even the squat and ugly ones.
- The spirit world doesn't admit to communicating with me, so it's fairly even.
- The secrets of success are a good wife and a steady job. My wife told me.
- I never abandoned either forms or freedom. I imagine that most of what could be called free verse is in my first book. I got through that fairly early.
- When modern writers gave up telling stories, they gave up the greatest thing we had.
- I have a plot, but not much happens.
- Shakespeare tells the same stories over and over in so many guises that it takes a long time before you notice.
- I've thought of the last line of some poems for years and tried them out, It wouldn't work because the last line was much too beautiful for the poem.
- History is one of those marvelous and necessary illusions we have to deal with. It's one of the ways of dealing with our world with impossible generalities which we couldn't live without.
- Obvious enough that generalities work to protect the mind from the great outdoors; is it possible that this was in fact their first purpose?
- I am not at all clear what free verse is anymore. That's one of the things you learn not to know.
- Language cares.

- The historian is terribly responsible to what he can discern are the facts of the case, but he's nothing if he doesn't make out a case.
- I've never read a political poem that's accomplished anything. Poetry makes things happen, but rarely what the poet wants.

- When I was starting to write, the great influence was T.S. Eliot and after that William Butler Yeats.
- We're not in love with Literature all the time - especially when you have to teach it every day.
