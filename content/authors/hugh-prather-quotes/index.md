- I will be what I will be - and I am now what I am. Here is where I will devote my energy.
- No matter what we talk about, we are talking about ourselves.
- I must act now without knowing the results. Thus, I give my actions their only possible meaning for me.
- Love does not exclude; it embraces. If we don't love someone outside ourselves, then very simply, we do not love ourselves.
- Now I know that this energy within me is seeking more than the mate or the profession or the religion - more even than pleasure or power or meaning. It is seeking more of me; or better, it is, thank God, releasing more of me.
- If the desire to write is not accompanied by actual writing, then the desire must be not to write.
- Tomorrow is shallow, but today is as deep as truth.
- How genuine is my capacity for love if there is no one for me to love, to laugh with, to treat tenderly, to be trusted by?
- If I hold back any part of me, I suppress that much energy and potential. The question I want to ask myself now is not what behavior is good or bad, but in what ways would I express myself with greater energy if I didn't hold back.
- We are always influenced because we do not live in a vacuum together with our intentions. We are in a relationship with everything that occurs.
- Boredom or discontent is useful to me when I acknowledge it and see clearly my assumption that there's something else I would rather be doing.
- My only sure reward is in my actions, not from them.
- Negative feedback is better that none. I would rather have a man hate me than overlook me. As long as he hates me I make a difference.
- I don't want to work to make money. I want to work to work.
- Ultimately, my character is defined by the quality of my sensitivity to other people. I exist in equilibrium. I am here to the degree I am there.
- Almost any difficulty will move in the face of honesty. When I am honest I never feel stupid. And when I am honest I am automatically humble.
- Maturity is wanting nothing but what we see with the purity of our heart.
- Discouragement, if pursued, is the exercise of an option: to turn from creative to noncreative mental activity, to turn from what is present to what is over, to turn from that which builds to that which destroys.
- Whenever we condemn, we cloak the world in pain.
- The way for me to live is to have no way. My only habit should be to have none. Because I did it this way before is not sufficient reason to do it this way today.
- It is only in helping someone else to awake that I awake.
- Sometimes I doubt, and sometimes I believe. I like not making myself believe when I am doubting and not making myself doubt when I am believing.
- There are people whose feelings and well-being are within our influence. We can never escape this fact.
- We are the only authority on what is good for us. Once we see this, we feel an enormous peace and freedom.
- Just when I think I have learned the way to live, life changes.
- To live for results would be to sentence myself to continuous frustration. My only sure reward is in my actions and not from them.
