- I think I'm much less self confident today. I actually went through a quite painful period because of that thinking that I was completely hopeless. But I think that's something that we all go through at various times of our lives and it was quite a sustained thing with me.
- It's a real pleasure to go to work when you're in the most extraordinary surroundings, and working with people who are young and interested and creatively keen.
- I guess I judge my films by how pleased I am with the work I do, so it's kind of on another level. If they do well at the box office, then that's great. Then I'm really pleased about that too.
- As an actor, to do all sorts of different films is great.
- As human beings, of course, we're all compromised and complex and contradictory and if a screenplay can express those contradictions within a character and if there's room for me to express them, that's a part I'd love to play, so much more than a character who is heroic and one-dimensional.
- To me acting originally became an extension of game playing.
- As an actor, to play someone who's at war with himself, that's so interesting.
- When you're a kid you have this sense of wonder and wholeness and a strong sense of your own identity.
- We're all outsiders in a way. We're all alone and can become very lonely.
- There's nothing like being on a massive-budget film where you don't know anything, and there's a million people, and no one's communicating.
- I think any role you need to play not so much transforms but I like to think of it as understanding the psychology of another character.
- I used to have two double espressos a day. I gave that up, had headaches for five days but now I'm feeling great.
- I do feel like I'm not entirely an insider.
- I'm so used to Australian films not getting a release outside Australia.
- I certainly don't advocate terrorism as a way of progressing and understanding people, nor do I believe labeling everything as a terrorist act is helpful either.
- I kind of like the challenge of jumping into totally different spaces and styles and figuring out how to fit in.
- I've often dreamed about going back to Nigeria, but that's a very romantic notion. It's a hideous country to go to in reality.
- Both my parents are English and I was born in West Africa, and I moved around as a kid, lived in Bristol, lived in Buckinghamshire and Surrey as a kid, and then moved when I was 16.
- I think often in film we limit our imaginations a little - well, quite a lot, actually... things get quite formulaic.
- The great thing about stage is that you have a live audience.
- It's great to blow the image that people have of me out of the water.
- Being in the woods at night is a beautiful thing.
- Initially I probably didn't even call it acting, but dressing up or something. As a kid I think you fully imagine the world in which you want to inhabit, so you put some clothes on and just kind of freely imagine this world, and it's a total imaginary world.
- I didn't get my licence because I wasn't allowed to. But I haven't had a seizure for a long time so I could, theoretically, get my licence. But I'm now just so used to not driving, I'm scared of what I'd do.
- I keep thinking I should get a phone, because everyone's got one and it becomes increasingly difficult to exist in a society where everyone else has moved ahead and you haven't.
- I still, by and large, make low-budget Australian films.
- If a film isn't really talking about who we are and what our psychologies are, then we're probably not that interested in it, actually.
- I generally find an affinity with a lot of the people I play and I suppose if I didn't feel an affinity for them then they wouldn't be particularly good performances.
- I'm 'of the world'.
- I don't think I'll ever escape the fact that I don't belong anywhere in particular. I've often dreamed about going back to Nigeria, but that's a very romantic notion. It's a hideous country to go to in reality.
- If the script grabs me and appeals to me, I'm really very keen to work on it.
- I think I'm a bit of a dreamer. I don't like the reality of life to impinge much on my life.
- Across the board, Australian films need to have a lot more money spent on selling them.
- I think when your image becomes so big that it's hard for a viewer to see a character, then I think you're in danger as an actor of being unable to perform what you should be doing.
- People are more likely to pass me on the street without recognizing me, and that's good.
- It's kind of chased away a few demons for me and, um, it's educated me a little bit more.
- Film sets are constantly amusing because you really are creating something that is so very surreal, and I kind of like that.
