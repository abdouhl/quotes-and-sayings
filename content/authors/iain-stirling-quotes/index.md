- My stuff is observational, what people do with their lives from the angle of a man that can't pull it off. So if I talk about having a family, it would be through the medium of a man who is in no fit state to be given a child to look after.
- A lot of ones I've really chased and wanted - as a comic, I've always wanted to do a 'Mock The Week' - it's always discussed, but for whatever reason it doesn't happen.
- Well, there are more job prospects after 'Love Island'.
- My father Rodger is your typical 'funny without knowing it' kinda guy. When he says something that creates shock or joy in a room, I love watching his confused face as he tries to work out what it is he did.
- But with voice-over on a reality TV show, I think I'm pretty up there, maybe one of the best. It's a confidence boost, which helps my stand-up because I'll try more interesting stuff.
- In 2005, I remember being told that I could get a job wherever I wanted.
- You will always worry - a wee lad from Edinburgh going up on stage in Glasgow.
- The one place I always get recognised for my voice - and this is the God's honest truth - is when I'm at the till in Topman paying for my clothes. Every time.
- Everything I do sort of goes wrong but I always sort of get away with it.
- I used to be on a live show with Caroline Flack, and I think I only got on that because I was a comic in Spain and ended up getting on well with her.
- I definitely enjoyed it and I am glad I did university - four years of not being in the public eye - and I met all my best friends doing it, so I am definitely glad it happened.
- Where I come from, everyone talks like me. It's working-class Edinburgh.
- I just feel like 'Love Island' is like a fantasy TV show. We're showing our, sort of, in my opinion, a comedy ideal of what paradise is like.
- I guess the argument is you chose to be in the public eye and, therefore, you're giving your life up for a certain level of scrutiny and you've got to accept that. The trade-off between being on 'Love Island' and not being on 'Love Island' is very skewed into the positive.
- Children are brutal and have no malice, which makes everything they say horribly cutting.
- I can deal with having a terrible night on stage in front a bunch of Glaswegians but not a bunch of Glaswegians and my mum and dad.
- I have always been a comedian - that has always been my job and it is what I want to do for a long time to come.
- I probably wouldn't be doing comedy, if it wasn't for the fact that I was doing stand-up and getting a few gigs, while I was also applying for law internships and getting absolutely nothing.
- I get recognised on the phone because it's harder to cover up your voice than your head. You can put a hat on or something, but I can't do accents.
- I've always been blown away by how unique Brian Limond's mind is.
