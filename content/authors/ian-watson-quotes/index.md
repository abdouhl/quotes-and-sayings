- I'm going to do the old 'plaster removal' technique and just get the pain over with in one go: 'Life's Too Short' isn't funny to me.
- The fact is that most 'Irish-Americans', in spite of dropping the word 'Irish' into half of all sentences, couldn't find Europe on an atlas, let alone Ireland.

- That iPad you just bought. Do you care that it cost a few pence to manufacture? No. It's cost you several hundred pounds because somebody else was willing to pay that much for it. If they weren't... it wouldn't.

- My father-in-law just happens to be a global procurement guru. Now retired, he was the global head of procurement for some of the biggest companies in the world as well as our very own treasury.

- My wife will automatically quote and compare the price of diesel at every petrol station we drive by, like she's got oil-based Tourette's.
- When I go to the interviews and sit before a prospective employer, I'm going to try and look as employable as I can.
- Dad's funeral was standing room only; most in attendance were strangers to me. At the back, a lone Marine stood silently, then left. People told me he'd saved their life or helped them in their darkest hour.
- I think we are living in paradise with regards to the ways we can amuse ourselves, communicate. We have such a richness of possibilities.
- The only time I even entertain the tiniest element of religion is for Christmas carols.
