- There is something magical about three you know - a trio is tight and nicely economical.
- I definitely like the mystery of not knowing how things will turn out, you know.
- I don't think our music has much to do with math rock.
- A lot of people on the internet have been saying that there's no way we can pull off a musical in three acts. We just take that as a challenge.
- Our music doesn't make many compromises, but we take it into a venue that's larger than people expect.
