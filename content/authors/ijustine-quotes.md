- Even if you're going into a field that has nothing to do with computer science, just having that way of analytical thinking and being able to process information and break it down is important no matter what you're doing. Having that knowledge of code is something that you can apply to your daily life.
- For me it's all just one big online world. Everyone has a favorite social network, and some people like YouTube more than Facebook or Twitter. But I make sure that when I post a new YouTube video, I post it on Facebook, and I tweet about it.
- When I moved to L.A., I had nothing but a computer, a lighting set, and a suitcase.
- I like to experiment with different things and find different uses for them. New things pop up every day - Snapchat, Vine, Parasail.
- I don't just shoot videos and post them. If it was that easy, everyone would be doing it.

- The challenges of writing a book are very different from writing a blog or tweets. I've been writing a blog since I was in the 6th grade, so I had this style of writing that was definitely not proper for writing a book.
- I made my first website in sixth grade. I was the only girl in my computer programming class.

- I've always talked to people about my grandmother, who is really into technology and has been on Twitter since 2006. It's unreal how tech-savvy she is.
- No one even has to leave their computer to find cool and interesting people to hang out with. Everyone is online in some form.
- When I grew up, I grew up in the middle of nowhere. I wasn't really able to have access to people other than like, my family, so being able to just have that access to people and technology to really change the world is incredible.
- I've always loved tech. Loved Apple. That's what I started vlogging about.
- I like video games. I like tech. I like travel. I like my dog. I like food. I'm like, 'That's what I'm going to focus on.'
- Always ask for advice. I email with a lot of girls that are like, 'How do I do this, how do I do that.' Stay up on what's cool and what's interesting.
- I'm sitting there for hours editing the vids myself. But I have a PR company and a management company. I use some editors for some of the cooking videos because they can be so long.
- I've always taken apart calculators and anything I can get my hands on when I was younger. When I was around 12 - like, 6th grade - my parents always had around Mac computers because my mom is a teacher. So I'd always be playing around with all the crazy applications and making banners and printing things out and always into graphic design.

- For me, growing up coding and computers and video games wasn't something that was cool, but it was something that I was always passionate about. I never let the fact that that wasn't something that was cool take me away from it.
- When I was really, really young, I wanted to be a cook at Bob Evans because my parents would always go there every Sunday after church.
- Even though I do share a lot of stuff, it's a very small portion of my life. And I think you just have to be careful because, anything that you post, it essentially is there forever. If it's not something you don't want everyone to see, don't post it.
- If there's something that you're passionate about, don't let other people take that passion away from you. If they tell you it's something you can't do, most likely you can do it, so don't give up.

- I hardly use a computer anymore because I have everything on my phone.
- It's daunting to go back through the past, to read tweets and come across Facebook profiles of people who have passed away. It stirs up memories you never actually shared online or never will share online. It was a very emotional process.
- I produce some of my music videos on a $200 budget. But I produce most of my videos on zero budget. I have a studio in my apartment - which is actually just a green screen I have tacked on my wall and some lamps to light everything.
- I've always loved technology. Growing up, I loved Nintendo and video games.
