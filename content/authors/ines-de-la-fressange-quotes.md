- Even if you live in a tiny village, there's an Internet site. It's quite easy to find clothes, but sometimes women don't know how to mix them.
- I saw a lot of haute couture all my childhood, and without knowing it I've learned from when I was a child to recognise beautiful fabrics.
- Buying a matching blouse and skirt from the same store is a crime. A clever mix of chic and cheap hits the jackpot. Know how to mix styles and labels.

- I would love to live in India or in the South of France, but Roger Vivier doesn't have offices yet in New Delhi or Jaipur.
- I had no luck when I started out as a model. I keep telling people that it's the only career in the world that you can't choose for yourself - you have to be chosen.
- One thing Della Valle taught me is the power to say no if something isn't right. That mattered even over sales.
