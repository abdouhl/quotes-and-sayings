- Being on an airplane a lot can dry out your skin, so it's important to bring a good mask to help refresh it. Also, I never go without SPF. It's one of the most important things to include in your daily beauty routine, no matter where you are in the world.
- The fashion industry, like others, is constantly changing.
- I was a tomboy growing up. Even after I started modeling at thirteen, I didn't learn how to do my makeup.

- I like a shoot when I feel strong and sexy, a little hard, with a darker edge. That's what I do best. I like giving a photographer what they want, working with the art director. And modeling is all I've ever known.
