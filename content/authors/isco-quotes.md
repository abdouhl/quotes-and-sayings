- We know that if you have a good game, you are God, and if you misplace five passes in a row, they want to kick you out of Madrid. You have to find the middle ground.

- I'm comfortable anywhere, as long as it's on the pitch.
- It is an honour that people are comparing me to Iniesta because of everything that he has achieved. But, and I have said this before, I do not like these kinds of comparisons. Andres is Andres, and I am Isco. I am a different person and player.

- I have a bunch of friends.
- Madrid excites me. They are one of the best teams in the world.
