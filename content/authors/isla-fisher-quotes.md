- I was raised as a tomboy with boys, and I never really feel like myself when I am really dolled up at premieres and showbiz events.
- I auditioned for a movie recently, and when I went in, the producer said he'd told one of its stars, Naomi Watts, that he was auditioning me, and she'd said, 'She's so funny; she's a great actress - you should hire her.' What a lovely, kind, and supportive thing to do for another woman.
- My mother worked when I was growing up, so I was under the impression I'd find it easy to be a working mum. But I found it very hard to be away from my family, even for short periods of time.

- You have to list all your special skills on a form when you get an agent. There's fencing, stage combat, horse riding, motorbike riding, Spanish, French, German, whatever. I just ticked everything. I talk about 10 languages according to that form. I even ticked the extreme sports box.
- Am I disappointed occasionally by the lack of irony in some movies? Yes.

- Being proud of who we are as people is more important than cutting into ourselves to create this false idea of beauty.
