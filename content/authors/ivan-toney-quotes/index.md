- I think I bring power and strength to the top of the pitch. I've scored goals but I know I could be more ruthless and get a few more.
- You must have high ambitions and high ambitions scare small-minded people.
- I want to play at the highest possible level - the Premier League.
- I believe in myself and I know I'm capable of doing certain things that nobody can really do, I would say.
- My agent is a Birmingham fan and I don't think Birmingham and Aston Villa get on too well.
- I want to be the man to take Brentford into the Premier League, but it's not just myself, it's going to be the other players playing a massive part as well. I'm ready for the challenge.
- At 18, I jumped to the Premier League from League Two which looks good on paper but it's about the journey and the stepping stones.
- You've got to be confident otherwise there's no point setting out to try and play at the top level. I feel like my ability will get me there, whether it's now, next season or whenever it is, I'm sure I'll be able to look after myself in the Premier League and do a good job.
- When you're a striker, confidence is key. The only person who can do it - and sometimes the only person who believes you can - is yourself. If you believe, anything is possible.
- The boost in confidence that kept me going in those early days when I was at Newcastle came from Peter Beardsley.
- Going on all those loan spells helped me massively. They turned me into a man quicker than I should have.
- If I had a pound for every time I heard Ollie Watkins' name I could buy half of London!
- I get told off by my mum for being a bit rough on the pitch. I'm in the referee's ear a lot - referees probably hate me - but it's just part of my game. My mum tells me off for that as well; speaking to refs too much.
- And physically and mentally, there were times when Newcastle first sent me out on loan, where I felt I was getting bullied. I was used to Under-23s football, tiki-taka, but in the lower leagues, it's about results and putting yourself about.
- Peterborough brought me in to do a job for them, which was to score goals. In the past they brought in strikers like Britt Assombalonga, Dwight Gayle and then shipped them on.
- Do I think I can get 25 goals? Yes. If you set targets, they must be sky high because if you finish just under it's still going to be a good achievement.
- I want to be an established Premier League striker that is starting week in, week out.
- I see myself as a Premier League player. If I see myself as a Championship player, that's not good enough. You have to aim higher and if you come just short then it's not too bad.
- If you want to achieve something, it doesn't matter what others think, you have got to make sure you achieve it.
- My mum keeps telling me to stop getting tattoos but I'll get a few more sneaky ones in.
- So from that first loan at Barnsley, I thought I needed to get into the gym and get a bit stronger. I realised I can't just be trying to play round people. You have to get stuck in in those leagues.
- I moved to Newcastle as a young boy aged 18 and went straight into the Premier League. It was crazy.
- It is up to me whether I continue to stay a Premier League player or just get caught up in the lights and fall back but I am sure that will not be the case.
- If you see yourself as a winner, you're going to be a winner, you're going to make sure you become a winner. If you see yourself as fearless, you'll be fearless. I think that goes far, not just in football but in everything.
- When you are excited and you want to do something, you don't really care how your body is. You look past that and just enjoy it.
- It only matters how you see yourself. Not how others see you.
- There's always pressure but I don't feel it. That's why Brentford brought me in. They believed I could fill the shoes of all the strikers that had been in there before.
- People can hide behind a screen. No one is going to do it at a match, in front of you, like throw a banana at a black player or something. They are very happy hiding behind a screen and being comfortable.
- I'm confident, a winner, a joker and someone who will help anyone.
- My mum has played a massive part in my life.
- A top striker like Harry Kane turns half chances into full chances by scoring them.
