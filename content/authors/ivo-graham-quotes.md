- Comedy is such a frivolous world that it can make you addicted to the frivolity, and then a lot of people don't settle down and are still in that non-specific age maturity bracket.
- I'm not a terrifically fit person. I haven't been for any exercise. I played a bit of football, ate a couple of apples. I got a gym membership last time I was in Edinburgh but it was very hard to unsubscribe.

- I went to Eton, that's a slightly controversial issue, but it's an interesting subject to try and come across as likable and self-aware and possibly even defeat a couple of stereotypes.
- I'm a better writer than a performer. Everyone wants to feel like they're a bit of a polymath, and I certainly feel that.
- I made a couple of friends when I was a teenager who said I was funny. I used to send them very long texts; it was on a Nokia and always exceeding the text limit. But if I was making jokes in a group nobody was listening.

- Mark Watson is someone I'm keen on as a fellow nervous person.
- The shaved head with which I returned to university in my second year was meant to give me a new air of mystery and menace. It did not.
