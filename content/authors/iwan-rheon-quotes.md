- When you write a song, there's no point keeping it to yourself.
- I have no ambitions to be a pop star.
- I just want my music to be put out there, not shoved in people's faces. I want to keep it relaxed.
- I was a huge Radiohead fan growing up.
- I'm always drawn towards the darker stuff, because I think it's just a lot more interesting. But it's also good fun doing the comedy, and I think that's why 'Misfits' has been great in that way, as you get a really good balance. I think it's best to try and do everything as an actor, really.
- I listen to a lot of reggae.
- I wasn't, you know, Mr. Popular. I was somewhere in the middle ground. I was quite alternative, the things I liked to do. Skateboarding, at the time. Playing in a band as opposed to playing in the rugby team. You know, that kind of thing.
- When I was a teenager, I wanted to be a rock star, not an actor. It means I can do what I want on my own terms.
- Playing live is closer to theatre, although when you're up there on your own, it's quite scary and revealing because you're playing your own songs. It's like a one man show that you've written yourself.
- I started off from a very early age listening to music - all the usual cheesy stuff that little kids like.
- I'm still secretly a bit of a punk. Love The Clash and a bit of the Pistols. I guess as I've got older I've chilled out a bit. But, my teenage angst is still stirring somewhere!
- There was so much great music around in the '60s, stuff like The Small Faces, but I also love The Jam.
- The first CD I had was 'Definitely Maybe' by Oasis, and I had a tape of' 'Parklife' by Blur when I was nine.
- I don't want to put any pressure on the music; it's my hobby and my release - a thing that I love.
