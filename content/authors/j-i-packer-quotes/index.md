- Christianity has stayed stable, as it must do. The doctrines don't change. The understanding of what it means to walk with God doesn't change. The reality of worship doesn't change, not at heart, anyway. So Christianity appears to be stuck.
- The books of C.S. Lewis had a very profound, indirect effect on me.
- Evangelical churches are weaker than we realize because we don't teach the confessions and doctrine.
- In some Old Testament books, it's very evident that an editor has been at work. That's quite all right. It's part of the process.
- I'm saying that an editorial process that is preparing the material for publication counts as part of the inspiring process whereby God, in his sovereignty, gave every word.
- I never get to the end of mortifying sin because sin in my heart, where it's still marauding even though it's no longer dominant, sin in my heart is constantly expressing itself in new disorderly desires.
- My advice to a new husband is nothing more than 'husbands, love your wives.' And 'love your wife as Christ has loved the church.' Never forget that you are Christ's representative in serving your wife.
- I'm not against technology, but all tools should be used to their best advantage. We should be spending our time on things that have staying power, instead of on the latest thought of the latest blogger - and then moving on quickly to the next blogger.
- I'm amazed at the amount of time people spend on the Internet.
- I must ask the Lord to direct the Holy Spirit within me to drain the life out of sin and in prayer.
