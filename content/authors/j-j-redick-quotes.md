- I feel like every guy has a job to do on the defensive end, and that job can change night to night. My biggest thing is, I try to do my job, and compete.

- As you progress as a basketball player, the world around you becomes more and more chaotic.

- To use a phrase that I don't often use, the NBA is very much a woke league. It's at the forefront of a lot of things - training, fashion, food, diet.
- I won't take a shot unless I think it's going to go in.
- I know when I was a kid, I looked up to athletes. So, if an athlete spoke out on an important issue, then I was probably more likely to hear that opinion and to see that stance and recognize the importance of that.
- There needs to be a dialogue between coaches, fans, players and administrators to promote positivity in the stands.
- Player movement is good, and guys should be able to choose where they want to play.
- I hate to admit it, but anytime you're at a stoplight and your phone is within reach? You pick it up. It's become instinctual. Even if you put the phone down and walk out of the room, you're always aware of where it is. It's become an extension of you.
- I didn't like the way I shot the ball in Milwaukee, so I worked really hard on my shooting - threes off the move and off the catch. And also continued to work on my ball-handling and my in-between game - my runners and floaters.
- Growing up, I didn't know anyone that was a watch collector or into watches, but I was always kind of curious about them. Before the NBA Draft, I knew I was going to get drafted, and I wanted to commemorate that by buying a watch.

- My last four years in Orlando, I was a really good player but I wasn't a full-time starter.
- I've never valued material things. I've always been more attached to people. The pursuit of material things takes time, and I realized my time is very valuable especially during the season. My time with my kids, what I do to take care of my body, and of course any intellectual pursuits I may have on the side. Those are all things that I value.
- I don't own a watch anymore. Literally, that was an addiction. I'm not afraid to admit that. It took me over. My possessions possessed me.
- I'm a Christopher Nolan fiend. I love 'Inception,' 'Interstellar,' 'The Prestige,' 'Memento' and of course the Batman trilogy. I love all his movies.
- I think with defense especially, you have your core principles. If you do those consistently, then it's easy to make, sort of, game-to-game adjustments. But, when you're not doing your core principles consistently, you end up just guessing a lot. To be honest with you, that's what bad teams do.
- When I was at Duke, I finally had an avocado - accidentally - on a turkey sandwich. I was hooked. Next thing I know, I couldn't get enough guacamole.
- I played videogames growing up, but my parents really monitored how much I was playing.
