- In this world, you can choose to be positive, or you can choose to be negative. You can choose to see things through a set of eyes that sees good, or you can choose to see things in life that aren't so good.
- You never think about what life's going to be like five years down the road or 10 - you just go though the day and try to make good decisions. Sometimes you do, sometimes you don't. You just hope this day will be a good day.
- You remember driving your kids to Little League, and they're nervous about making the team, and you're encouraging them. Forty years down the road, we're having the same conversation. Only it's about the Ravens and Steelers, or Stanford and Cal.
- There's no family in America that can celebrate a victory better than the Harbaughs. You'll never hear more laughter, more storytelling, or more embellishment.
- You've got to be yourself, and if you're not, you're a phony. It comes shining through if you're not careful.
