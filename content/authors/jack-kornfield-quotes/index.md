- Sense the blessings of the earth in the perfect arc of a ripe tangerine, the taste of warm, fresh bread, the circling flight of birds, the lavender color of the sky shining in a late afternoon rain puddle, the million times we pass other beings in our cars and shops and out among the trees without crashing, conflict, or harm.
- Westerners, more than most Asians, are prone to feelings of fear, self-hatred, and unworthiness.
- Buddhism talks about the possibility of transforming greed, hatred, and delusion. But sometimes need turns into greed.
- Part of spiritual and emotional maturity is recognizing that it's not like you're going to try to fix yourself and become a different person. You remain the same person, but you become awakened.
- In my experience, psychotherapy at its best is like dual meditation - it's like a container in which you can be compassionate and mindful toward yourself.
- Spiritual practice should not be confused with grim duty. It is the laughter of the Dalai Lama and the wonder born with every child.
