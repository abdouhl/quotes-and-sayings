- I don't take myself seriously in the slightest, so it does amaze me that I've ended up being in all these very dark, sinister plays. But I love it because, touch wood, I'm lucky enough not to have that level of darkness in my life.
- A lot of the time, when I watch actors now, I think, 'I don't believe you.'
- I had the benefit of there being no stigma attached to the arts. My brother's a ballet dancer, and he never came up against anything.
- There are such strong women in my life that there's no chance of me getting too big for my boots.
- I want to play in as many theatres as possible, work with as many brilliant people as possible, but definitely do a new play.
- I'm fascinated by sports, the buzz of winning, and the buzz of losing.
- I was actually deputy headboy at my school. And everyone around me was very supportive of what I wanted to do. There's no romantic story about how me and my brother got to where we are.
- Learning how to put someone in an arm lock without breaking their arm... It's quite handy isn't it?
- I hate chilling. I hate even the notion of chilling. I like doing stuff.
- Everybody knows the story of The Smiths. You can still go and see Morrissey.
- There's never a case of, 'Ooh, I touched a nerve there.' It's make believe.

- I grew up on the stage, and there's no two ways about it: you only get one chance to do your bit.
- I'm not running about playing romantic leads. I don't know if that's a good or a bad thing, but it's the way it's sort of working out.
- I didn't grow up listening to The Smiths, but now I am a fan. I love his music and listened to so much of it for the film. It's not a regular biopic; they picked a part of his life that people don't really know about. You learn what informs his lyrics.
- When I was on stage, I was like, 'This is alright. This is good.'
- If you speak to any soldier, even now, they say they are fighting for their friends. It always ends up that they're fighting for the man next to them.

- The parts I've got to create are a little bit different to a lot of guys my age.
- Everything always looked better in black and white. Everything always looked as if it were the first time; there's always more people in a black and white photograph. It just makes it seem that there were more people at a gig, more people at a football match, than with colour photography. Everything looks more exciting.
- Our parents were just brilliant parents who encouraged us to do whatever we wanted to do.
- I grew up on stages. Not standing outside the 'Royal Court Theatre' wistfully, but with enthusiastic people from the community.
- One trap you can fall into when playing someone iconic is to end up doing everything in an iconic way, no matter how pedestrian or mundane that thing is.
- I've no idea if I want to do this for the rest of my life, so I want to try and work with the best people I can.
- I had an unhealthy obsession with 'Only Fools and Horses.' I still have to watch an episode with my brother every two or three weeks.
- There are so many avenues to explore and stories to tell. It's just about finding new ways of telling them.
