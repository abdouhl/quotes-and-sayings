- When I meet someone who I really admire, I enjoy nothing more than trying to connect with them and asking them about their career. I want to know who the people are behind the performances and how they relate to their performances. But it's maybe not as novel as it once was.
- I was raised as a Catholic. I went to a Jesuit school - obviously, being from Ireland, was brought up in quite a regimented belief structure. I shed a lot of that rigidity and got a sense that there are definitely forces that we don't understand. I think 'magic.' It's a word to apply to some of those things.
- I think that diversity in your performances is what keeps you alive as an actor. You have to keep constantly evolving and surprising the audience and showing them that you can do things they didn't expect you to do.
- There's nothing wrong with giving yourself a pat on the back. If you can't do that, you can't be objective about your work. You can't be conceited or cocky either, but you can't be too modest either.
- I bring a copy of 'Dracula' with me wherever I go, the book. It's my favorite book in the world, it's absolutely incredible. My great-great grandfather was the guy who printed the first edition, so he's the first person to ever put 'Dracula' on the written page.
- There's no need to live in L.A. Half of Hollywood's films are shot in London, anyway.
- I don't want to shoot myself in the foot when it comes to getting work. But I'm just not as interested in most of the films that are made in the States. The characters aren't as compelling. The stories aren't as substantial.
- 'Star Wars' was something that I was definitely interested in. Whether or not I was really involved isn't something that I should probably disclose.
- My least favorite thing about New York is probably the traffic. I hate it. The people are such aggressive drivers here, they're horrible.
- What appeals to me in a project is, I'll read the script, and I'll be like, 'Is this something that's new and something I haven't experienced before?' And if so, 'Am I gonna be able to handle it? Am I gonna be up to this challenge?' That's what I try to do.
- If you have an opportunity to reach people on a broad scale, it's not enough to just entertain people. You have to take responsibility. You has to do something substantial. Otherwise you're squandering what you have.
- With 'Richard,' I was excited to make this film with such an amazing role for an actor. Play a wide range of emotion and really invest myself in the character.
- With 'Transformers,' I'm going to get to drive fast cars and have a lot of fun. That's what appeals to me about it. I want to have as much fun as possible.
- I'll put it this way: with the kind of films that I do - creatively driven, with interesting directors and writers - I don't feel the need to work with the super established, top-tier directors that are out there.
- I definitely used to dream of sitting in the movie theatre watching the 'Star Wars' credits come up knowing I was part of one of those films.
- My favorite thing about New York is the view, the skyline.
- I feel as though maybe our concept of time and space is very limited. Maybe everything is all happening at once, if you know what I mean.
- The first movie I really clicked with was 'Die Hard' when I was 6 years old, which is crazy that I was watching it that young. That was the one that made me want to become an actor.
- When I was a little, little kid, my family got a new washing machine, and they had a big box that was left over. So I cut a big hole in the box, and I made it like a giant TV set. I brought it into the living room, and I did the news and the weather for my family.
- I was an only child until I was 14, and there were no other kids around the area really. So I spent a lot of time on my own in the fields or by the lake, with just my imagination for company. I suppose I never wanted to let that part of me go.
- In terms of doing another franchise after 'Transformers,' I don't know if that would be best for me. I'm really happy to inhabit the world of independent film.
- As a kid growing up, I put a lot of pressure on myself.
- 'Transformers' gives people the ability to relax and rest for three hours. That's a substantial amount of time, given how plugged in to our devices we are. People don't give themselves enough time to sit down. They're no longer comfortable with themselves.
- If I'm brave, 99% of it comes from my mother.
- I make it my business to see or do something cultural in every place I go to. If you don't, you'll get into a state of constant despair.
- Unless I'm a little bit scared about something, I'm genuinely not actually entirely happy. I feel I need to be just that little bit outside my comfort zone, and then I can really surprise myself and stretch myself, and I think that's a really good thing for any actor.
- For me, working on original material is very important.
- I was a huge fan of 'Blade Runner.' That was a pretty formative film for me growing up. It really got my sci-fi juices flowing, as it were.
- I went up for the first time when I was 18. It's a great place - I love L.A.; I mean, in Ireland it just rains all the time, it's crap weather, so it's nice to go to L.A. where it's just sunshine every day, and then it's kinda easier to live a kinda healthy lifestyle.
- I've always been a big fan of Philip K. Dick; I love his work. There's a returning theme of identity and the fragility of our identity. Even when we are looking at what we think is a stark reality, it might actually be something completely different.
- I'd love to do a film with Michael Fassbender. He's one of my heroes. I think he's absolutely amazing and I would love to do a project with him.
- I couldn't even get an audition for network TV at home in Ireland.
- When I was a kid, I used to pretend I was Han Solo all the time. Running around with my fingers pretending they were a blaster.
- So many Irish actors overplay that modesty because they're afraid people will judge them and say, 'The state of yer man, he thinks he's great,' or whatever.
- It's hard to say how far we are down the road to our conventional understanding of artificial intelligence, but I think what we've developed so far, if it's not already consciously awake and hiding from us because it's seen what an ugly and destructive race we are, and it's trying to preserve itself, it's probably in a state of dreaming.
- I originally got into this because of a five-year-old's begrudgery of his teacher. Mrs. Lawlor cast me as a tree, and I was disgusted. I was sure I had more to offer than that. It was like, 'OK, if you want me to be set dressing, fine, I'll take it on the chin but I'll show you - I'm going to be a big actor some day.'
- I wake up pinching myself with the things that I've had the good fortune to be able to do. If it all ended right now, I'd be completely fine with it.
- I was a very forward kid. Quite intense. I'd walk right up to you and say, 'How are you? My name's Jack.'
- I was always a big fan of Charlie Chaplin movies. I love 'The Great Dictator' and 'City Lights.'
