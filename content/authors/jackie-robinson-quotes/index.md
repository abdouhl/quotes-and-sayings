- If I had been white with the things I did, they never would have allowed me to get out of baseball.
- I had no future with the Dodgers, because I was too closely identified with Branch Rickey. After the club was taken over by Walter O'Malley, you couldn't even mention Mr. Rickey's name in front of him. I considered Mr. Rickey the greatest human being I had ever known.
- Baseball is like a poker game. Nobody wants to quit when he's losing; nobody wants you to quit when you're ahead.

- I had practiced with the team, and the first scheduled game was with the University of Missouri. They made it quite clear to the Army that they would not play a team with a black player on it. Instead of telling me the truth, the Army gave me leave to go home.
- I felt unhappy and trapped. If I left baseball, where could I go, what could I do to earn enough money to help my mother and to marry Rachel? The solution to my problem was only days away in the hands of a tough, shrewd, courageous man called Branch Rickey, the president of the Brooklyn Dodgers.
- Today, Negroes play on every big league club and in every minor league. With millions of other Negroes in other walks of life, we are willing to stand up and be counted for what we believe in. In baseball or out, we are no longer willing to wait until Judgment Day for equality - we want it here on earth as well as in Heaven.
- In all my years of baseball, I have always expected to be traded. I never liked the idea.
- The right of every American to first-class citizenship is the most important issue of our time.
- Blacks have had to learn to protect themselves by being cynical but not cynical enough to slam the door on potential opportunities. We go through life walking a tightrope to prevent too much disillusionment.
- I guess you'd call me an independent, since I've never identified myself with one party or another in politics. I always decide my vote by taking as careful a look as I can at the actual candidates and issues themselves, no matter what the party label.
- Many people resented my impatience and honesty, but I never cared about acceptance as much as I cared about respect.
- After two years at UCLA, I decided to leave. I was convinced that no amount of education would help a black man get a job.
- I cannot possibly believe that I have it made while so many black brothers and sisters are hungry, inadequately housed, insufficiently clothed, denied their dignity as they live in slums or barely exist on welfare.

- The old Dodgers were something special, but of my teammates overall, there was nobody like Pee Wee Reese for me.
- Pop flies, in a sense, are just a diversion for a second baseman. Grounders are his stock trade.
- I think if we go back and check our record, the Negro has proven beyond a doubt that we have been more than patient in seeking our rights as American citizens.
- This ain't fun. But you watch me, I'll get it done.
- The most luxurious possession, the richest treasure anybody has, is his personal dignity.
- I speak to you only as an American who happens to be an American Negro and one who is proud of that heritage. We ask for nothing special. We ask only that we be permitted to compete on an even basis, and if we are not worthy, then the competition shall, per se, eliminate us.

- I'm not concerned with your liking or disliking me... All I ask is that you respect me as a human being.
- A life is not important except in the impact it has on other lives.
- I want everybody to understand that I am an American Negro first before I am a member of any political party.
- It kills me to lose. If I'm a troublemaker, and I don't think that my temper makes me one, then it's because I can't stand losing. That's the way I am about winning, all I ever wanted to do was finish first.
- It would make everything I worked for meaningless if baseball is integrated but political parties were segregated.

At least I had made my men realize that something could be accomplished by speaking out, and I hoped they would be less resigned to unjust conditions.
- The way I figured it, I was even with baseball and baseball with me. The game had done much for me, and I had done much for it.

- I have always been grateful to Colonel Longley. He proved to me that when people in authority take a stand, good can come out of it.
- When I am playing baseball, I give it all that I have on the ball field. When the ball game is over, I certainly don't take it home. My little girl who is sitting out there wouldn't know the difference between a third strike and a foul ball. We don't talk about baseball at home.
- There's not an American in this country free until every one of us is free.
