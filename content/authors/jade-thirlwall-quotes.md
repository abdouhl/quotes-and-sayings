- I think it's a bit shocking for people when pop stars say anything out of the safe zone.
- You don't have to be in a rock band to write your own music.
- I think you have to remember that the people that are really muscly and toned at the gym started somewhere. You have to remember that they didn't always look like that, so when you're in there, don't look at them and feel intimidated.

- I spent so much of my time when I was growing up just worrying about what people thought of me, about my appearance, how I should act in school, how to... be popular and all that rubbish. Stop worrying about everything. Everything's going to be okay.
- I find it really funny that men can always get away with being a ladies man. Everyone thinks it's really cool. But a girl can't really date boys all the time because everybody looks down on her. I think boys get away with things so much easier.
