- I've grown up with bhangra and Haryanvi folk dances.
- In the time you make one series of 9-10 episodes, you can make 3 films.
- In my journey, I got amazing characters to play which were as interesting as a lead role. In 'Commando,' my role was so good. I feel no actor have rejected that kind of a role.
- With rising Covid-19 cases and deaths in India, the government should have thought of the repercussions before opening liquor shops.
- For an actor, his job becomes easy, when his character is described well on the paper. With a well-written role, it becomes simpler to design and understand your character.
- Even after my film 'Khatta Meetha,' I was jobless for a year.
- I have no complaints from my characters, be it in 'Commando' or 'Gangs of Wasseypur' everyone on those films was grey.
- Whenever I read a script or sign a film, I don't see whether he is a bad guy or a good guy. I see how much the character is contributing to the story? How much is the importance of the character in taking the story forward? And what new I would be able to learn and what new I would be able to try in that?
- My father would tell me my defects but never praise me to my face. The good things about me he would only tell others when I wasn't around.
- When 'Raazi' released, I think I was ready to embrace complex roles and some challenging characters with responsibility and restraint.
- Fame is a mirage.
- As an actor, it filled me with joy that 'Raazi' was well-received and it gave me an identity and improved me as an actor. It was Meghna Gulzar's guidance that brought out the best in me. She is a receptive filmmaker who knows the art of extracting a performance.
- Hathiram Choudhary is a vulnerable, intense and deep character. Like every common man, he just wants to prove himself and better himself. But he is also bound by his philosophies.
- Hathi Ram's journey intrigued me. He is a very vulnerable character. I was never offered such a role of a man who is a failure in life and is desperate to prove himself. It was a good change for me to play someone with such a nice arc and so many shades to his personality.
- A terrorist for one man could be a patriot for another.
- I am even ready to dance if someone is willing to write those parts for me.
- As soon as the director says action, an actor has to do the same work no matter if the screen is small or big.
- I am ready to work hard, do comedy, romance and action. Just give me that trust.
- Ups and downs are part of life. One has to try out his best and march ahead.
- I am okay with the fact that my work reaches out to the people.
- If one keeps working hard then no one can stop them.
- It's not necessary that everything needs to be spoon-fed to the viewer for every story.
- Who doesn't want to be a lead hero?
- I hope many think that I can also do vulnerable parts and not macho, antagonist parts in which they've seen me.
- When the coronavirus-positive cases were 500 in the country, you ordered the shops to shut down, and now when the tally has crossed 50,000 you are opening them. I don't understand the logic.
- Being born in a small town, you have got many advantages. You get to experience so many things in life.
- I'm not the sorts to have many hopes. There's no point.
- I love dancing and can very well manage Bollywood dancing.
- It does not bother me whether my work is reaching the audience through cinema, TV or a web series.
- I think with Shahid Khan I knocked at the door of Indian cinema. It was a beautiful character and Anurag Kashyap managed to bring that on screen with the same beauty. I was lucky to play him and become a part of a milestone film like 'Gangs of Wasseypur.'
- When you come from FTII, people take you seriously. The environment at the institute is very conducive to learning.
- Hathoda Tyagi is such a strong character despite no dialogues and expression. He's the most difficult to break. It would've been interesting to play him.
- Ever since my childhood, I had an urge to always stay in the limelight.
- The mode of work as well the reach of all media are different.
- Pataal Lok' explores the depths of human and societal immorality through a captivating storyline and exemplary talents.
- Gangs Of Wasseypur' was a confidence booster for me.
- Two directors always come with two thought processes.
- It is an interesting feeling to be appreciated within the industry and from the audience as well.
- More than good co-actors, if you have understanding co-actors, it becomes easier to relate with them. Many actors become insecure and get personal, which is not right.
- Unlike star kids, we do not have the liberty to do anything and be famous.
- I don't think anyone will be able to answer why one did not get success from their work. It's just part of life. Sometimes your work is good, but the character does not fully reach the audience.
- It feels good to get new opportunities.
- I have to do good roles.
- It is the responsibility of filmmakers, actors and writers, who have the freedom to do the kind of work they want to do irrespective of whether it is good or not.
- In my village, Kharkara, 20 km from Rohtak, I would work in our fields of sugarcane, wheat and paddy while dreaming of the day I would join the army, and receive a hero's welcome every time I came home on leave. In our part of the world, a soldier is a star.
- You get more time to see the growth of a character in a series, there's no scope for that in films.
- When the material written is very good then half of your work is done by the writer itself. When there's a well-defined character written, then the attempt is to be as honest to the material as possible.
- I have worked with brilliant people, so it has been a great journey and learnt a lot from them.
- When we don't say 'male director,' then why call them 'female directors?'
- Becoming the character you are playing might work for some, but for me, it doesn't. I always maintain a gap between myself and my character because if I will go so deep into it, it will get difficult for me to come back. You should work towards understanding the psyche of your character and then play it.
- The time I heard the script for Hathiram's character in 'Paatal Lok,' I was sure it is one of the best characters that I had ever been offered. I am extremely overwhelmed with the kind of responses that I am getting for the performance.
- When you expect something, there's also a certain fear about whether or not that expectation will be fulfilled.
- If tomorrow someone writes a romantic story, I'd like to bring a romantic shade of mine too. When someone puts that trust in you then you can do it.
- I don't mind getting typecast as long as it is not overpowering me as an actor.
- Audience want to watch a good performance at the end of the day.
- We humans need to reboot and learn to have gratitude for our doctors, police officers, or those providing essential services, otherwise they would feel that it's a thankless job. They risk their lives for others and don't even get time for their own family. We need to be more compassionate, caring towards them instead of misbehaving.
- Every 10-15 years, society changes. The thinking of a 10-year-old kid changes when he turns 20. Such changes can be seen in every aspect of life. People's preferences also change with time.
- Every actor has his own approach towards acting. I believe you do not become the character you are playing. You may get closer to it but you do not lose yourself. There's just a reflection of the character in you.
- One should approach life with a realisation that nothing is permanent.
- People who are highly motivated, when it comes to dogs, they will go to any extent. Sometimes I feel that dogs play a more important role in their lives, more than other humans do.
- If you normally go quiet when you get angry, you may not relate to a character that reacts very differently. But if you see someone internalising the anger like you do, you will immediately identify with him or her. It's these small things that penetrate your psyche and make you relate at a deeper level.
- I weighed 100 kg while shooting 'Paatal Lok.' I am 6 feet and therefore it might not appear that I weigh so much.
- I come from a family of educationists and both my parents as well as my younger brother and his wife are teachers.
- Most of the characters I've been offered have been very dominating and self-assured, maybe because of the way I look.
- They say, you don't get anything before time and more than fate. I truly believe that and have never felt the need to fight it out, to say 'why this didn't happen earlier.'
- At one time, smaller, and story-heavy films were not appreciated much but exposure has made the audience aware of what great story-telling is. This has also ensured that the right actors are cast for the right kind of roles.
- More than being a star, I want to be an actor. This may sound cliched but that is how it is.
- I am a dog and a cat lover; doesn't matter which animal it is but dogs are cuter at times.
- When you are on a journey, every pit stop is your favourite.
- It's foolish and such a shame that we attack those working for everyone's safety.
- It's an extraordinary story told with simplicity. 'Raazi' is about people who put the country before anything else.
- We all go through the phase where the work is slow and aren't sure if what we are doing will have returns in the future or if it'll reach people at all. You can't fight that.
- You get onto the stage; you can shout and express yourself. Your negative energy gets consumed.
- Acting is just part of my life. It is not my life. Whatever time I invest in acting I give my 100 per cent. But there are other things which are also important and I like to give equal attention to them.
- In someone's life, dogs can be very important which in turn changes everyone else's lives.
- Every one wants to play a lead, be it negative or positive and I'm no exception.
- I love Sanjeev Kumar's cop portion in 'Sholay.' Manoj Bajpayee in 'Shool' was also amazing.
- I was lucky to be a student of FTII, Pune.
- When you stop searching, wanting and wishing things - only then they start appearing.
- Got a chance to work with amazing and finest directors like Priyadarshan, Anurag Kashyap, Imtiaz Ali, Meghna Gulzar, Vipul Shah, Dibakar Banerjee, Kamal Haasan, etc.
- You have to play your part as an actor at the end of the day, regardless of the medium.
- There's a reason why you attach the luck factor to your hard work. You work hard in every film, but there's always that one film that comes at the right time and does the best for you.
- I have known Abhishek Banerjee for a long time. There have been a lot of films in the past where we were rejected together. We have seen each other's journey. He is an amazing actor.
- I am very romantic inside.
- While Anurag Kashyap is a very chilled out guy and let his actors pitch in with their ideas, Kamal Haasan is an encyclopedia in himself. Merely listening to him enriches one so much.
- FTII had people from all over India and abroad and they had a different mindset. They would talk about world cinema and there I was - the only foreign films I had watched were probably Arnold Schwarzenegger's and dubbed in Hindi at that!
- When you get creative liberty, it's amazing.
- It is great for your work to get through to both the masses and classes.
- I was in a bad shape after missing out on my army dream. What I couldn't say and express to everybody, stage gave me the space to release.
