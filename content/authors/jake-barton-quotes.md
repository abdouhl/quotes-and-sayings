- It's hard to make something feel like it needs to exist.
- A lot of our insights are based on the ways in which people spend time at museums. They're curious, open, interested, and engaging. They want to express themselves and see their own identity refracted through the museum's.
- People come to museums for storytelling and engagement, and the technology needs to facilitate that.
- People learn more if they're learning in directly engaging ways.

- The Memorial Finder covers the gap. It tells you the specific panel and number where you can find an individual but begins to reveal the connections between the names themselves. As you move around the site itself, a smartphone app will reveal adjacencies as well as the stories behind the names.
- Whether it's a computer or a pen drawing, design is about drawing shapes and making physical things.
- Kids are prone to be on their phone and their iPads, prone to sharing things and making things. Instead of trying to divorce education from that, let's lean into that.
- From a UX standpoint, the toughest battle is how to make a platform that's really open so kids can use it but has sort of hooks and constraints so it's actually driving towards revealing parts of the world through science or through mathematics.
- People are moving into modes of participation and self-generation, which apply to everything from museums and television to architecture.
- Museums, I think, are becoming more and more aware of how to turn themselves into a must-see spectacle.
