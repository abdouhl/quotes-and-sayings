- There's nothing like winning and winning at a high level.
- I think there's a role for everybody. Even a guy who's not known as a scorer, like a DeAndre Jordan - he sets the best screens, he blocks the most shots, he gets the most rebounds, he's great for your team, he helps you win games. Like, he helps you win big.

- I think when you're starting you have more of a luxury. You know you're going to play 33, 35, 37 minutes per game, so you can kind of feel the game out. When you come off the bench you have to be more in attack mode. You have to make something happen immediately.

If you were somebody who was not so nice and you came into a lot of money and fame, then you're probably going to abuse that in the wrong way. But if you come into those things and you were doing the right things, then chances are you're going to do more of the right things.

- Basketball has given me everything.
- Whenever I retire, I'll still be playing the game, whether that's at an L.A. Fitness or somewhere else.

- I'm into people that are not too full of themselves. Just regular.
- Honestly, I want to be known as a great ball player, but it's more important for me to be known as a good person. Like seriously, the greatest gift you have as a person is to give something to somebody else.
- I'm a baller, I'm a hooper.

- I feel like part of the reason I play basketball so much is it just feels good. In the summer I play every single day.
- A prodigy to me is someone that is enormously gifted at a young age - to the point that people can't deny it. I think when you are a young kid and you are a prodigy, other parents, when their child is on your team, they aren't even mad that their kid isn't getting the shine because that other kid is special.
- Like, I don't do drills at all. I think that's why a lot of people who handle the basketball, I think mine looks different. You know, 'cause I've never done a drill. I've never done 'get to a chair and go through your legs,' or 'get to a spot and a cone and go through your legs or behind your back.'

- If you put it in perspective, I loved basketball before I loved everything else, you know what I mean? Before I had a girlfriend or even childhood friends, I had my basketball. So it's my first love.
- I mean, the hardest thing to do, I think, in the NBA, is to put the ball in the hole.

- The love of playing trumps all of that, to be honest with you. Even the day I retire, I'll still be playing somewhere.
- I used to sneak into the Forum to watch the Lake Show, when I lived in L.A. with my pop. I was born in Seattle, and for fourth, and fifth grade, I went to L.A., then I came back to Seattle and then back to L.A. for eighth, ninth, and 10th grade. But it was easy to sneak in the Forum, like really easy.

- At the end of the day, only one team wins.
- Winning always cures all.

- The goal is to win a championship, but when you win and you play pretty well, and you start hearing 'All-Star' and 'Sixth Man.' That's really unbelievable.

- I give Seattle credit for grooming me, making me the person I am today.
- I remember when I was 8 years old when I first started playing organized basketball, and the coaches had the kids in single file doing two-line layups and they were struggling to get the ball up there. Me, I'm doing reverse cradle layups with the backhand spins on it, like, jump from the right side and lay it up on the left side backwards.
- You know, my first nine years I only played for two teams, Chicago and New York. And the only reason I got traded from New York was the 2010 free agency period, when they had a chance to sign LeBron and D-Wade and that whole class, and I understood that. But from there it's kind of been a roller coaster.

- The Knicks were one of my favorite places to play - just the energy of the New York fans in general is amazing.
- No matter what the trends are in the NBA - teams going big, going small, getting more efficient with analytics - the ability for a player to create his own shot, then convert tough shots, will always be a weapon, particularly when you get to the playoffs.

- I have to pray before I play, and I gotta eat right before I go out there. For a while when I was younger, I would always eat chicken tenders and fries no matter what.
- I don't take time off. If you've been out of a house for six months and then you come back in and you turn the light on, it might explode. It isn't used to be used. I keep my energy going. It's not a shock to the body when I start playing again. I don't have to 'get in shape.'
