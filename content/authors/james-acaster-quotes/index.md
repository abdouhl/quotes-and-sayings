- I thought all good art is you doing exactly what you want to see. I didn't realise that's not even what I really like about art. Bands I liked weren't doing just what they want to do: they were finding their common ground with them and me.
- I left school and didn't go to university to be in a band.
- And that, ladies and gentlemen, sums up the Fringe. Spend a year spitting your guts out writing a show, and people forget your name as soon as they walk out.
- I'd decided to write about stuff that I would like to hear standup about.
- I'm great under pressure.
- Everyone was wearing jeans, so I started wearing slacks. I'd walk on, and people would laugh before I got to the mic because I looked stupid.
- What if every relationship you've ever been in, is someone slowly figuring out they didn't like you as much as they hoped they would?
- Because such a massive part of stand-up is trying and failing first, I'm not putting as much pressure on. Just going out and doing it is enough.
- I'm always writing, always working.
- People like abstract art because it makes them feel clever.
- I grew up with interesting and funny people. We made our own fun. You had to use your imagination.
- Every year in Edinburgh, I end up waiting behind the curtain about to go on stage, and I have a moment of thinking, 'No one's told me what to do with this show. I've done exactly what I wanted. This is the biggest arts festival in the world, and all these people have shown up. Aren't I lucky?' It really is amazing.
- One of the things I figured out was that I was having good gigs when I wore jumpers. It was because I looked more like an outsider, so they expected me to talk about weird stuff rather than normal stuff.
- If a comic laughs at their own jokes, I don't like it. They shouldn't find it funny; they should seriously believe in this stupid thing they're saying.
- Ross Noble at the Leicester De Montfort Hall on his Randomist tour - it's the only time I've hurt from laughing at a standup comedian.
- If people are coming to see me because they like what I do on 'Mock the Week,' that's great because they are coming to see me being me.
- My parents are very good examples of Christians. They are big on forgiveness.
- First I stopped believing in hell, then the afterlife. Sometimes that connection is still there, and I'll feel an impulse to pray if I'm stressed or upset.
- The comic I can now never enjoy again is Bill Cosby. He was truly one of the first comedians I got into.
- There's not many comedy characters that make me laugh as much as The Rock does; it's nice to have a big muscly guy being funny and stupid.
- There's no excuse for panel games, other TV comedy shows, or even live bills to be made up mainly of men.
- When you're talking about a really horrible personal thing that happened to you... and it doesn't get laughs... I feel really exposed and like I've overshared with some strangers.
- There were plenty of times before I did stand-up where I needed counselling, but I didn't go because it would have meant I was officially ill.
- Certain celebs manage to worm their way out of the spotlight, and I won't stand for that.
- I like touring, and I like stopping off at service stations and driving along motorways.
- Until you get left for Mr. Bean, you don't realise how frequently he pops up. There's a shop two streets from my house that sells masks of his face. There's nowhere where I'm going to go that he's not there.
- I really love standup, and I really love writing standup.
- Every comic delves into the personal archive when their imagination runs dry.
- I'm almost able to be more honest by lying. By making everything up, I'm able to say what I really want to.
- I know what I want to talk about, but I don't really know what's funny about a joke until I perform it in front of an audience.
- I thought comedians were the funny guy in the common room, not understanding that the flaws in my personality were actually the funny things about me.
- I used to work with autistic children, and they said a lot of funny things to me.
- I definitely want to be as good and original as I can.
- I'd say I get heckled quite a lot because I look quite like an easy target. If you're an alpha-male and you think you've got something to prove to your girlfriend, I think I'm the perfect person to prove your worth.
- I remember being four or five, not understanding how to be funny, so just going around the house and my mum and dad's friends, confusing adults by saying weird things.
- You can play a gig as a band and not know that they hated you; with standup, after every line, you know.
- I never liked wrestling, but I thought The Rock was brilliant, and that is a statement to how funny he is that I'd even watch a show that I didn't like just to see him on it.
- I'm not a big depressive, but I have my moments.
- I thought, 'Anyone can make up a lie, but making the truth funny is really hard.' But I actually had more problems with people believing me when I told the truth on stage.
- I got left for Mr. Bean. I found out a year after we split up. I opened the newspaper and there was a full-page story. No one else in the history of time has ever been left for Mr. Bean.
- The Rock was one of my favourite comedy characters growing up, and I still think he is. Mainly because he took himself so seriously by being ridiculous and a buffoon all the time but always took the high status.
- Corduroy hits the sweet spot between jeans and slacks. They're a trouser middleman.
- I absolutely loathe sleeping in a tent, regardless of the weather.
- If people leave the house wanting to see a comedian, they want to see someone speak out for themselves and share true stories from their life.
- I think I can draw both a mainstream audience and an alternative audience to my shows. I also have the ability to disappoint both.
- My mum is very funny when she wants to be.
- If you just focus on getting better, and not being the best, you have such a good time.
