- My experience as a young actor on network television was that I couldn't make it work. I was drowning as an actor.
- The older I get, the more vegetables I eat. I can't stress that more. Eating healthy really affects my work. You not only need to be physically prepared, but mentally and spiritually.
- Kids will tease you for just about anything.
- I always like playing the bad guys. They have more fun!
- As an audience member, I live vicariously through the characters I watch or read about. There's something very relatable about comic-book characters. They're never perfect. They're flawed people put in extraordinary circumstances.

- I'm a pretty private person, so I'd like to say I'm a good ear and that I keep my mouth shut.
- The biggest regret I have about 'Rubicon' is that we didn't end it. Sometimes you do these shows and you don't have the opportunity to get closure. Stories are supposed to have a beginning, middle and an end.
- In a weird way, I live vicariously through the characters I play as an actor.
- I've always thought that I'm kind of a cross between a young Bill Clinton and Lyle Lovett. And I just want to say I'm proud of that. Those are two good looking guys.
- I grew up in a family of actors. I grew up onstage. The choice for me wasn't, 'Do I want to be an actor or not?' I always felt like that's just ingrained in you, the need to perform. The choice was, 'Do you want to do this professionally or not?'
- I want to show up to work and take risks. I don't ever want to play it safe.
- I can't go to the hardware store, cut a sheet in half and staple it to the window anymore. It doesn't fly.
