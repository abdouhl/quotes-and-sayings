- A lot of sportsmen get depression, all sorts of mental health issues. A lot of people retire and you don't hear from them, but I don't want to do that.
- The bottom line is that players have to be responsible for getting themselves in the right frame of mind.
- I like my boxing and jiu jitsu and that kind of stuff and one thing I always enjoyed from an early age was shooting. My godfather got me into it. It started with airguns and shotguns and that kind of stuff.
- If you've got aspirations to be tested to the absolute maximum you want to be in the starting line-up.
- We can't have tech just for the sake of it. To maximise the potential of technology solutions you have to understand how to use them.
- I've always been confident in my rugby ability but with England I had to adjust my behaviour.
- At most grounds you're not particularly conscious of the crowd but in Cardiff, with the roof closed against a good Welsh team, the noise is impossible to ignore. It can be loud enough to put you off your game and the Welsh undoubtedly possess some of the most passionate fans in the world.
- You bring your strength to the game - that's what I've learnt, and that's what I try to bring to England.
- It must be very daunting being an individual sportsman.
- If you want bigger arms, target the triceps, not the biceps.
- I think as a professional sportsman you're aware that your time is limited.
- When I was about 15, I learnt that training hard doesn't get easier, you just learn to push harder. That's a powerful mentality to master.
- I want to do presenting, I love DJing, I love writing but none of it's a guaranteed job so it's still very scary.
- When I left rugby and bought my first commercial gym membership it was a shock to the system. I went in there and saw people training and thought 'I've got to get out of here and get in a proper gym.'
- I've learned that, bizarrely, I enjoy having a fight. Obviously nobody likes getting hit, but I don't have a problem with it. In MMA you've got to take a few hits to reach the right position.
- International rugby is an unforgiving arena.
- In my limited experience, you have to make your own decisions in life and experience things for yourself.
- As soon as you're put on a pedestal, you're easily knocked off it.
- It's one thing to get beaten by a side who are a lot better than you, it's quite another to know you've thrown victory away in a game you should have won.
- You just shouldn't be spending your summer watching TV.
- All players want nice things to be said and written about them and you have to take the reverse in equal measure.
- Wherever I've played, I only affect the breakdowns that are in front of me.
- Some people think of players and supporters as 'them' and 'us.' The truth is that we do what we do because we are all fans at heart.
- We're removal men. It's hard labour. I've come to the conclusion being a forward is probably the worst thing in rugby. Looking at backs, they play kick and laugh, run and clap and we get absolutely flogged.
- I've always felt Twickenham has a special aura.
- At some point, the power side of the game has to peak, players can't get much bigger. Guys will be doing more footwork and explosive-speed stuff.
- When you have two-thirds of possession in any match you have got to turn that pressure into points.
- It doesn't matter if you've got the best team in the world, you can't play rugby on your own try-line.
- My favourite Heineken Cup memory as a player was undoubtedly sharing in Wasps' final triumph in 2007.
- I do not want to gain a reputation for lacking discipline because I always look to play within the laws.
- I've lost count of the times I've been asked what I do for a living. When I say rugby people say: 'Yes, but what's your other job?'
- When I am doing something I give it 100 per cent. I work on it, do it and go onto the next thing.
- Although the TV commercials will try and have you believe otherwise, there is nothing good about breakfast cereal. No matter how 'low fat' or 'high in fibre' the box tells you it is, ditching the high sugar cereals is the first step you need to take towards a better breakfast.
- To get any win, especially against a Welsh side, is very satisfying.
- I'm always pretty fair-handed.
- To be the best in the Heineken Cup or the Top 14 you've got to win home and away.
- I'm all about helping people understand more about exercise in general and more specifically on occasion, about certain key parts of their body and physique.
- I don't want to become a player who spends half his time running round after the breakdown, because that won't get the best out of me.
- In reality, rugby is finite and unpredictable, so players need to have skills off the pitch too.
- Statistically, there have to be more gay men in rugby than we know about and I would hate for them to be going home from training and feeling depressed or feeling like they need to live a lie.
- If your form dips as a back-row forward, it is best to address the areas you know you're going to be heavily involved in.
- As a rugby player I got into the habit of tackling without thinking. But in MMA you've got to land the right way. You can't flop. You've got to bounce back to your feet. You've got to use your sprawl.
- Actions always speak louder than pre-match words.
- In order to pack on the most amount of muscle from your training, you need to train specifically for hypertrophy.
- If no one ever made a mistake we'd never get anywhere. One side would keep the ball until half-time and the other team would do the same for the whole of the second half.
- I'm a white middle-class public schoolboy so I'm not particularly tough. But it turns out I don't mind going in the cage. I can dig in. And it's interesting watching people spar and train. There's no anger. It's all technique and delivered with venom.
- I'm obsessed by coffee.
- I've played with some of the best players in the world, and I've loved every minute of it.
- Fulfilling your ultimate childhood wish is a surreal experience.
- I love Twickenham. It's the best place on earth to go, even when it's empty.
- I can't have cinema popcorn because it's all full of sugar, unfortunately. Well, I do have it and I don't have it. I love movie night and there's lots of healthy brands of popcorn nowadays, so it's good as a snack.
- No self-respecting gym goer skips leg day.
- It is difficult for people across the world to be comfortable with their sexuality. We need more education and awareness.
- To stay at the elite end of professional sport you need to show an awful lot of dedication.
- Rugby is a sport in which you can lose heavily one week and still come back and smash the opposition the next.
- I wanted to play Super 15. I wanted to develop some maturity, some leadership and to work on my skill set. Also I want to have played all round the world.
- Front squats and trap bar deadlifts are the two best big compound movements for quad growth.
- Trust me, Stade is not a comfortable place to be if you're losing, regardless of the venue.
- It was so important to have stuff outside of rugby so you have a life balance. I took a lot of criticism for that earlier in my career and thank God I ignored what everyone else said and did what I was always going to do.
- There's no doubt that 'the plank' is one of the best core exercises on the planet.
- If you want to build a larger physique that actually makes you look like you lift, you need to train your shoulders, back, triceps, glutes, and legs more frequently. You probably also need to suck it up and train them harder than you ever have before if you want them to grow.
- In rugby I think it is good to have a bit of a persona, a bit of a character because we are one of the last things that isn't necessarily controlled.
- Going to a final and winning is the best thing in life, and it makes rugby no longer a job. It makes it fun.
- A lot of people make the error of thinking rugby is going to last forever and they need to quickly discover that that isn't the case.
- We owe it to players, young and old, to train them thoroughly so that they can take full advantage of the insights that tech offers them. And what is true in sport also applies more widely to business.
- I like to think I am honest and open.
- I hate losing and I think it's good to feel a stab of anger if it happens.
- There's only one Lawrence Dallaglio and there's only one James Haskell.
- People think of rugby players as being tough but it's another thing to stand in front of someone and get kicked, punched, taken down. In rugby you have two contact sessions a week and you play a game on the weekend.
- Matches aren't won on the training field and there is no point flogging experienced campaigners unnecessarily.
- I've got a 20 inch neck, a narrow waist and big bulging thighs so stuff off the rack doesn't fit. It's a nightmare to shop for shirts and trousers that are going to fit, because they'll be tight in one place and all baggy everywhere else.
- The first step to optimising testosterone is eating right. That means cutting out the processed junk food and focusing on high quality proteins, carbs, fats, and an abundance of fruits and vegetables. Don't fall into the 'low fat' eating trap, as this will seriously inhibit your testosterone production.
- I reckon every player feels much the same on the eve of a Six Nations championship. We all want to finish top, win the title and do our respective countries proud in the process. We're also aware a lot of other people are seeking precisely the same thing. Pessimism and optimism collide like two ferrets in a sack.
- As a player you have to look after your body because no one else will. I'd rather be proactive than kowtow to everyone and be injured all the time.
- Do I respect my competition? Yeah. Do I always think that I could do a better job? Of course.
- If you get an opportunity to win any silverware you take it.
- I think 5G is going to make a dramatic difference in sport and beyond.
- I've been written off more times than some of the government's tax returns but I just keep plodding along.
- Unfortunately, there tends to be an easy way of doing things in life and the Haskell way. As a 12-year-old I knocked my front teeth out while chasing a friend in the rain. I'm the type who offers to serve wine at drinks parties and accidentally pours it down one of the guests.
- My first memory is being taken for Indian food at the Cookham Tandoori on the High Street - I remember the poppadoms, the onions, the chicken tikka.
- People make very many comments in life when they don't have the background or the knowledge.
- People talk a lot about the Welsh fans but English supporters are also among the world's best.
- If you have any ambitions to improve and be a world-class side, you have to be very tough on yourselves.
- I don't think my parents imagined I'd represent England when they first drove me to mini-rugby at Maidenhead. I was only five but mum lied about my age to get me out of the house.
- When I started my professional rugby career, in 2002, there was one guy filming training if you were lucky.
- Someone once told me I looked like Mr Incredible out of 'The Incredibles.'
- Good nutrition must be at the core of all that you do training and health wise.
- There is nowhere to hide as an international back-row forward.
- My best games for England were under Eddie Jones. Eddie got the best out of me. He understood that I needed an arm around me, needed my tyres pumped up.
- I was diagnosed with ADD when I was 14. Weirdly enough, I then learnt, through doing different things, to concentrate.
- As a schoolboy I can recall playing three games a week and not even feeling it.
- Shooting's not actually a bad place to take a girl on a date, unbelievably.
- I love deejaying and got the opportunity to do a music production course online and loved it, but I am about as musically talented as a house brick.
- I was consuming the most food when I came to Wasps. I was eating six meals a day - 250-300g of protein, 300g of carbs, 250g of veg, six times every day. It was extensive, horrific. And tedious.
- It's important as a team that you don't get too excited with a win and you don't get too disappointed with a loss. You have to stay very steady, very focused on that middle ground.
- If anyone out there is mildly curious about rugby, I'd recommend a weekend spent watching the Six Nations. I don't think you'll be disappointed.
- The best players aren't necessarily the biggest.
- Going to Stade Francais will not just make me a better player but make me a better player for England.
- Frittatas are delicious, convenient, and can even be eaten cold - perfect if you're working against the clock to make your morning meeting.
- I was always on to the next thing. I didn't celebrate all the little moments in my career that I should have done, I always focused on what was next, how could I do better.
