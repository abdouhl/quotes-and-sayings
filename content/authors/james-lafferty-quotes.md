By working for it I mean work on your craft, learn from people who have something to teach. It's just like anything else, practice makes perfect.
- Students of American glass must always keep in mind that the creations they collect are truly examples of our American culture... and thus have historical significance.

- The whole Haley-Nathan marriage deal was a pretty good twist huh? I hope we got all of you with it. That particular story line even suprised me when I read it, it's a good one and it'll provide for some good stories to come.
- What I remember most about junior homecoming was my date getting sick afterwards. That kinda sucked. Then, senior year, someone got gum in her hair when we were dancing. She had to get one of the chaperones to take her to the office and cut up her hair. I felt really bad for her, but it worked out fine.

- My New Year's resolution is to stick to a good workout plan that will keep me healthy and happy.
- I wouldn't say that I'm very similar to the character of Nathan at all. Both of us have had very different upbringings and backgrounds. I have a competitive nature like the character of Nathan. That's really easy to draw from when I'm acting; that's probably the biggest similarity.
- It has been common knowledge to informed collectors that many times the finest and rarest art glass is found unsigned.
- I don't get a whole lot out of the romance thing, but I realize girls do. So I'll go out of my way to make them feel romanced.
- I enjoy catching our show whenever I can. It does get very weird to watch myself, it's always been that way, but at the same time, it's part of my job to see what kind of job I'm doing and to get a perspective on where I'm taking the character.
- When I'm trying to go to sleep and there are little noises, like a clock ticking or a fan squeaking, it drives me completely insane.
- The cast gets along pretty well, it's a good work environment. I hang out a lot with Brett Claywell, he plays Tim Smith on the show. We play plenty of basketball.

- It is definitely a challenge to play Nathan, but the more different he is from myself, the more interesting the character becomes for me.
