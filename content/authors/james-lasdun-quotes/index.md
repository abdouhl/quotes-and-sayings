- I am not a supporter of Israel's military policy, let alone any kind of Zionist.
- There is something uncannily adaptive about anti-Semitism: the way it can hide, unsuspected, in the most progressive minds.
- The short story seems like the best of all possible worlds. I do feel it is closer to writing poetry than to writing a novel, with its requirements of concentration and economy.
- There are seldom more than a couple of students in any workshop who seem natural writers.
- The nature of fiction is to make one distrustful of any character who lectures and castigates.
- Writers tend to write stories as a kind of holiday between novels, or as preliminary steps towards a novel. Stories just don't often make up a writer's main body of work, and that's not because they don't see the market for it.
- I don't think I could, with a straight face, describe myself as a completely positive person, but I'm not overly negative, either. On the whole, most writers think plots through to their consequences, and it's not always a sunny place. I have an occupational temperament for anxiety.
- I consider myself a writer. I don't favour any type of writing. I sometimes wish short stories came more easily to me.
- I got into online trading. It was alarmingly easy to do. I went through the whole cycle of emotions, from supreme self-confidence to total impotence. I broke even in the end.
- For a long period of history, you were what people said about you, and if your reputation was stained, you were in very serious trouble. People fought duels over this. Then it fades away historically.
- What the Internet offers is this completely unfiltered transmission of thought to thought, of psyche to psyche, and whatever you're feeling, you can just sort of put it down and send it out there, and you can do it all in the confines of your room, without any actual contact.
