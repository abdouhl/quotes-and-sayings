- Acting-wise, I did a web series. I play a music agent in a series called 'Keeping Up with the Downs.'
- I never have been a big coffee drinker.

- I honestly always thought my Master's in Fine Arts would get me further in the acting world than knowing how to work an espresso machine!
- I have a friend who wanted to practise on my head because they wanted to be a stylist. So I offered what hair I had left to turn white.
