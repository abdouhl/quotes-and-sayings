- I thought I was God's gift to mankind and the greatest Irishman since George Best.
- When I did the film 'Hear My Voice' a few years ago, I disappeared fully up my own backside for a while. Because I thought my career was taking off, I became a bit of an egomaniac and a pain in the neck. I thought I was God's gift to mankind and the greatest Irishman since George Best.

- You can get a bit world-weary in this job, and 'The Passion' reminded me of what a fantastic job acting is and how lucky I am to be doing it.

- When I turned 40, subconsciously, life was a blank sheet. Before, it was disjointed, and I was very displaced and quite mad, but it was a brilliant time. Everyone thinks I must have been unhappy.
- If I get to the end of my life, and people say, 'He was in 'Cold Feet,' well, I was, and it was great. I thought the fourth series wasn't great. I thought there were weak episodes throughout.

- The reality of life in Northern Ireland is that if you were Protestant, you learned British history, and if you were Catholic, you learned Irish history in school.
- As fabulous as technology is, it can also make us very anxious.
- You don't learn charm. It's not something that you can acquire. I have used it much in my life with great success, but it's not necessarily what makes me an actor. It became a very easy label to attach to me. It also feels a bit dismissive. People go, 'You're so lovely and charming', but it's a wee bit, 'That's all you are.'

- 'Spoilt' is a euphemism for 'loved.'
- I've never felt that acting was my vocation - never had that tortured thing. I love acting, but it doesn't feed my soul.
- I've heard some duff Irish accents. The worst must be Mickey Rourke.
- I think a lot of us who grew up in Northern Ireland weren't politicised enough, frankly.

- It's easy to get carried away with yourself.
- I get an awful lot of people coming up and saying they went to school with me. There must have been 80,000 pupils at that school!

- Improvising political dialogue is not easy.

- When I went to university, I was already working professionally with the Ulster Actors.
- What I discovered all over Ireland is that people living simple lives by the sea or in the remote countryside seem a lot calmer than city folk with their iPads and their Android phones.
- Funnily enough, Northern Ireland is a great example of where politics can win over conflict. The decision to down arms and follow a political path would have been unthinkable once. It shows just what is possible.
- When I was growing up, Belfast City Hall was surrounded by security, and we had no access to it. But now, people come in and out of it all the time.

- All my adult life, there was the Troubles. That was the backdrop of my life.

- Producers get very jittery about things.
- I'm not very good at standard English.
- Drama asks some uncomfortable questions at times... It goes to pretty dark places.
- My best friends are still the ones I first attached myself to when I went to school because, all of a sudden, I was leaving the rather pampered and occasionally very annoying world of having three older sisters to go to a male-dominated world.

- I lived a dual life, and when my dual life exploded, I began to feel much happier.
- Acting was a godsend. I found myself because I loved acting.
- I think often there is great rivalry between neurosurgeons and cardiac surgeons. I think I maybe have a bit of bias with neurosurgeons' opinion that nothing tops neurosurgery! But that makes for a quite interesting conflict between the two.
- I'm not strong-willed enough or unkind enough... or maybe simply not wise enough to tell a journalist that a subject is out of bounds.
- Ours was a very progressive Protestant family, but my parents were God-loving rather than God-fearing. We went to church, and I still go with my mum and dad when I return home - it's a family thing. I played flute in my dad's marching band, but I had an integrated upbringing. We had a lot of Catholic friends.
- I went to India with UNICEF in connection with Manchester United to raise money for children's education.
- I've never thought of myself as a classic leading man. I'm a character actor who happens to play leading roles. Come on, look at me. I'm really Desperate Dan.

- I was one of the many kids in Northern Ireland who grew up in the countryside and had an idyllic childhood well away from the Troubles.
- I'm not an actor who is often asked to be in period things.
- Tumours can come out of nowhere.
- Although surgeons know how to deal with bits of the brain, they don't really know how it works.
- Brain surgery is a fairly aggressive process. There's a lot to get through. There's the beautiful, delicate shaving first, which is really lovely. There's a wonderful ceremony of putting all the covers on, so only the little bit you're operating on is revealed. But once they make the incision and tear the skin back, the drill comes out.
- That thing of briefly losing sight of a child happened to me when the kids were younger, and you can't see them in the supermarket or wherever. It's a terrible, terrible moment... the most unimaginable horror.
- My early ambitions were the same as they are now - to play for Manchester United. I was, and still am, football mad.
- Acting is something you didn't do in Ireland.
- I've always been a family man and count myself as one of those who are lucky to have the comfort of a family.
- Before I read the 'Bloody Sunday' script, I have to admit I hadn't thought about it that much. There was probably even part of me which assumed there was no smoke without fire. That the Catholics who were shot must have done something to provoke such a response from the army. I was extremely ignorant of the whole situation.
- It's hard to make a film in Britain. It's hard to raise money. The best stuff that is shot on film in Britain is usually shot on film for television.
- I spend an awful lot of time by myself and enjoy that.
- My preference is for good writing. It doesn't matter if it's for film or TV. Whatever. It starts with the writing. Even though I've had problems with writers, it doesn't matter how great of an actor you are. If the writing is bad, you're going to struggle.
- I never forget that I'm extremely fortunate.
- Because I grew up with women, I have a certain amount of charm, and I'm all right to get on with, kind enough, funny enough, blah blah blah.
- Love your parents, but don't have them as your mates.

- There's no such thing as unwanted attention for an actor.
