- My wife never went to many Liverpool games but if she was out on a Saturday, she would always ask someone for the score. If we had won, she'd simply be relieved that I would be coming home in a good mood.
- The top coaches want wide strikers who cut inside. They want playmaking midfielders who can play between the lines as well as perform their defensive duties.
- Centre-back takes more out of you mentally than physically.
- Managers can make themselves look strong by selling or dropping players, but if the move doesn't work, the choice looks flawed.
- We are not a nation who has ever produced No 10s prolifically. When I was growing up, attacks consisted of a big man-little man combination, with two midfielders sitting behind.
- I've been in the position where Liverpool needed to win on the last day to reach the Champions League. In May 2000, we needed to beat Bradford, who were fighting to avoid relegation, at Valley Parade but lost an awful game 1-0.
- There is pressure, and I would never complain about that, but as players we put pressure on ourselves all the time. That's one thing I won't miss when I finally stop playing.
- For the life of me, I'll never understand why the teams that have the best defences get criticised. Shouldn't clean sheets be a badge of honour for defenders and goalkeepers?
- If I'm reading a book by a footballer I don't want to read about games, how he scored or played well. People want to read what you thought, not what happened.
- Del Bosque was axed by Madrid for failing to retain the Champions League in 2003 but his sacking triggered the start of a spell when they won nothing for four years and failed to get beyond the Champions League's last 16.
- Well, when I wasn't playing with a football I used to play with 'Star Wars' figures as a kid. Hanging out with Chewbacca and Luke Skywalker is how I passed the time when I wasn't kicking a ball around.
- The crowd, especially at Anfield, want us to win so much that it transmits itself down on to the pitch at times.
- I never wanted anybody to think that I deliberately hurt opponents. The vast majority of players are the same.
- People always want to talk about the club, whether it is positively or negatively, and if you play for Liverpool you have got to get used to that as part of the job.
- Medals were - and always will be - the best thing to show your accomplishments in football.
- You can shape statistics to make them look however you want them to.
- Liverpool has always had speculation about managers, players, players coming, players going and it's the same as managers. That's part of being part of a big club, you always have that type of thing.
- Liverpool midfielder Xabi Alonso was always bemused by our enthusiasm for tackling, because he saw it as the last resort.
- Not playing for Liverpool would hurt me more than not playing for England.
- Normally in the past whenever Everton have beaten Liverpool, the accusation was that they wanted it a little bit more.
- In the past, you would have been classed as a sweeper if you were put in the middle of a three-man defence.
- Don't get me wrong, the fans are great for us. But the fans, and the players, all of us together have to realise we have to be patient.

- Managers are never appreciated when they're in the job.
- There is so much I admire about Buffon. His longevity is remarkable, his loyalty to Juventus impeccable.

- In knockout football, it's one bad game and you're out.
- People go on about how much players earn in the Premier League but once you've bought a nice house and car, what else is there to spend it on?
- Liverpool is no different to any other city in the country for footballers. If you are famous and people know you have money, there will always be someone who wants to make a name for themselves.
- In the modern era, with the rewards the top players have during their career and the risks involved moving into management, more will look at it and say they don't need it.
- Playing for England is a bonus, but playing for Liverpool is what I want to do.
- I only missed nine Premier League games from a possible 228 between August 2004 and May 2010.
- When the tone needs to be set and the crowd need to be revved up, nothing is better than a big, shuddering tackle.
- There are times when I watch Jurgen Klopp leaping around after Liverpool have scored and I think to myself: 'I wish that was me.'
- It's all about winning trophies really.
- Real Madrid is such an extraordinary club in terms of size and the constant politics that, perhaps, the best results are achieved by those with an ability to remove themselves from the spotlight to concentrate on their work.
- There's one thing I've never seen in a paper. Jamie Carragher linked with this or that club.
- I was born on January 28, 1978, the same day as Buffon.
- The pressure from within used to have an impact on my behaviour. If games had gone badly, I would take things home with me. I'd be snappy at my kids and felt constantly wound up.

- At the end of a career you're desperate more than ever for medals, grabbing as much as you can as you go.

- Compared to other clubs, what we've achieved under Gerard Houllier is exceptional.
- When Robben joined Chelsea in 2004 nobody realised how good he was. He was seen as an excellent player rather than a world-class one, and he suffered a lot with injuries. In the years since, he has elevated his game.
- Players like people saying good things about them and, of course, no one is ever wrong when they do that, but they always are when they say bad stuff.
- I don't mind a bit of cricket, but it has to be something massive like the Ashes.
- There were players who could leave the result at Anfield, but me? No chance. I got involved in the running of two restaurants in Liverpool to take my mind off football but, before the opening night of each one, I'd played badly. It meant I couldn't enjoy the party. It felt like I had to punish myself.
- Why does it get assumed that Zidane is a figurehead and everything Real achieve is down to the talent of the squad?
- I want to be a manager, it wouldn't scare me, but I also think you could be sacked in six months and you'd have to take the kids back to school with your tail between your legs.
- We are constantly told to enjoy Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo before they retire but what about Arjen Robben?
- I'm not massively into the screamers, because I think sometimes fellas just hit it and there's an element of luck over whether it flies into the top corner or over the bar.
- The reason Ozil has as many detractors as supporters is he is a bit of an anomaly - an elegant, skilful footballer who at his best evokes memories of the great number 10s from the past, but sometimes looks unsuited to the extra demands of a changing game at the very top.
- Everyone's different with different ways of doing things.
- Anger and bad experiences used to fuel my performances, but it was horribly draining.

- Coaching for tackles? That's something you do with seven-year-olds, when you show them how to stand and when to make a block. It is one of the basics of the game. No Premier League manager needs to coach it.
- The two managers I worked under longest are Gerard Houllier and Rafa Benitez. I have so much respect for the two of them.
- It's been a privilege for me, really, to play for one of the biggest clubs in the world, an iconic club, an institution.
- If you'd asked me at the start of my career I would have said I was going to be a manager. I may still be in future, but there seemed to be an expectation it was a natural progression for me.
- Arsene Wenger is a legend in the English game.
- The buzz we had in 2000-01 was unique. We played 34 matches between January 1 and May 19, but lost only four.
- You talk about results being more important than performances but, ideally, you want to put the two together.
- Many in top positions around Europe have devoted their lives to coaching.
- For a 20-year-old kid to be taking on Liverpool Football Club over a contract. To the pit of my stomach that just winds me up, it angers me.
- When I think of Xabi, my mind goes back to the first training session he had at Melwood in August 2004. And the same word always leaps out: wow! Rafa Benitez had talked him up before he arrived and immediately you understood.

- We want to play a full year, July to July, because that will mean we've been successful.

- Every manager has his own ideas and different ways of doing things.
- People make relegation out to be a fate worse than death but that's nonsense. If the infrastructure is right, clubs can bounce back.
- The captain at international level has to be someone who is one of the first names on the team sheet, someone who has the respect of the other players and someone who has good leadership qualities.
- It is embarrassing that a player would give up his career and the chance to compete for the biggest prizes in the game just for money.
- We have all come to agree the modern players cannot be one-trick ponies, and we are especially critical of those who do not consistently produce in the biggest games.
- We talk about the Arsenal 'Invincibles' of 2004 and the team who won the Double two years earlier and drool over their attacking play. It is easy to forget, though, that virtually the same squad had won nothing for three years.
- I'm no different to other working class players.
- I understand that we're paid a lot of money and we're in the limelight. When things don't go well, there's deserved criticism.
- I've played for Liverpool's first-team pretty much every week for 16 years.
- I'm always trying to improve.
- I think with my generation, your first game of senior football was often a Sunday League game of football. Sometimes you're playing on pitches that aren't great, you've no referee, you've no goal nets.
- Nobody in football wants to receive sympathy.
- People talk about managers having certain styles and philosophies... well, Benitez manages by conflict. Look right through his career and you will see it everywhere.
- Would I - or any defender - tell the referee to give a penalty if I made a foul in the box but it was deemed a fair tackle? No chance.
- I was an Evertonian as a kid, but I've never hated Man United. I've always had respect for them.
- Centre-back is my best position. I think everyone is aware of that.
- I always thought just because I love football, it doesn't necessarily mean I'm desperate to manage.
- We sometimes undervalue the importance of goalkeepers.
- I always think when you're in the Champions League, as a player, as a fan now, you're in that to come up against the biggest teams and the biggest names - that's what you want.
- Without Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo, we would discuss Robben more often and with more appreciation.
- We're only human and when things aren't going well the confidence does go a little bit.
- We take the plaudits when things are going well so you have to take the criticism when it's not going well.
