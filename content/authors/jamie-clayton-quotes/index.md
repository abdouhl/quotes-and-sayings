- I'm a huge television fan, in general. I love TV. I love movies. I always have. It's what I do, and I love it.
- We have to learn to adapt to people and changes. Change is good.
- For me, at the end of the day, I want to be judged for my work, not for what I've been through and past experiences, necessarily.
- I'm definitely focusing all of my attention on acting. Modeling comes up by default, and I love it - of course I think that it's great - but I'm definitely focusing all of my attention on acting.
- 'Different' is such a good word. For me, ever since I was little, I always felt that something was off. And I just didn't have the resources to - I just didn't know what it was.
- I love who I am.
- If I have a connection with someone, I'd like to think that they'd be able to respect that connection enough and respect themselves enough to not care about my past - that they would want to see what happens between us.
- I think what people need to realize is that, with trans people, we're like everybody else. No group of people are all the same. All women are not the same, all men are not the same, all children are not the same. It's the same thing with trans people - we're all so different, we have different goals, different dreams, and different aspirations.
- I was always just so feminine. I don't think anyone who ever met me would describe me as a man.
