- I'm much more at home with Daffy Duck than I am with a real person.
- I can draw and paint in many different styles, and use different mediums to create work.
- That was always my dream as a kid: to draw comic books.
- My mum was into pottery and embroidery, very artistic, and she knew some people from the college, which I think was how I got into it. My dad, who was a head-hunter, was also an incredible artist, and when he was very young, he was a really good cartoonist.
- I am in that position where I finish something, it goes out, and I'm onto the next thing. I finish it, it goes out, onto the next thing.
- I need to find a way of retaining creative control.
- I took a lot of influences from Studio Ghibli, which is the Japanese animation studio that made 'Spirited Away' and 'Castle in the Sky.' They're like the Japanese version of Disney - but without all the schmaltz.
- Look at someone like Kanye West - ego is the death of a lot of art. To believe in yourself that much is to stop being an artist.
- I grew up doubting myself. It was a very spotty, frustrating, worrying time.
- I'm always having ideas. I'd like to continue being able to realise the ideas I have.
- The art world's quite elitist. I tend to skirt around that world.
- I have a problem with making eye contact with people, or with holding eye contact.
- I see the 'z' in 'Humanz' as referring to robots, AI, programming, brainwashing, indoctrination. And it's a question to us: are we human, or are we humanz? Have we lost the ability to think for ourselves? Do we just believe what we're told? That's how I see it.
- The more you draw, the better you get.
- Some comic artists I've known are better than most contemporary artists with work hanging in Tate Modern.
- I love zombie films.
- I'm all about doing things myself because I find it hard to trust other people. Not trust, but I know exactly what I want to do, and I know exactly how it's supposed to look.
- I can't see anybody wanting to go to 'Tank Girl: The Musical!'
- I used to love comic books, and I love American comedy, and neither are afraid to tackle big themes.
- I love to draw and paint - that's what makes me happy.
- It's not that I never do interviews or that I find them traumatic. It's just that I'm basically not that comfortable doing them.
- I don't like collaborating too much.
- If you're going to pretend to be somebody you're not - which is the whole point of being a rock star - then why not just invent fake characters and have them do it all for you?
- My parents weren't very good at keeping things, which is why I treasure my own sons' work so much now - I don't want to lose anything.
- You can write and write, but if you don't have someone who can nail that character, it's never going to live.
- When I'm working on something, if I went to an exhibition of an artist I respect, then I usually come home quite depressed and look at what I'm doing and throw it all away and start again.
- I start with an idea in my head. I sketch it out quickly as a line drawing, using pencil. It never comes out quite right - usually a bit better than my mental picture.
- When a picture is done, I'm not concerned with it anymore; I'm on to the next thing.
- I want to do stuff that excites me and is enjoyable.
- To be an artist is to doubt yourself and try harder.
- I don't go to enough exhibitions, purely because it intimidates me.
