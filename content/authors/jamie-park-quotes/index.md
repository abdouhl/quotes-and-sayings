- My music is about me and my experiences.
- At one time I wanted to be a comedian.
- I want to set up a music school for the needy who cannot afford musical education so that they can realize their dreams.
- After winning 'K-pop Star' and debuting as a singer, I had a team of people who helped me. But then I realized that to do my own music, there's work that I myself had to take care of and no one can do it on behalf of me. So I started writing my own music.
- I've been through a lot of throwing myself away, and finding my way back. Making myself who I wasn't, then finding me back.
- I'm not sure if fans are ready to accept my music, but I no longer wanted to be known as a 15-year-old girl who would sing 'Over the Rainbow.'
- When you prepare an album, it's really hard and stressful and you don't get too much sleep.
- I would love to do musicals, sitcoms and even television talk shows. I think I have the potential. But most importantly, my ultimate goal as an artist is to create a new music genre like Elvis Presley.
- I, at times, was disappointed when my songs were neglected by executive producer Park Jin-young, but learned a lot in the journey finding out what would appeal to a wider audience.
- I just want to show that you don't have to be changing yourself 100 percent to be someone that you're not. You don't have to change yourself to be someone like your idol. You can be someone's idol just by being you. But also, it takes a lot of work and time to be that sort of person.
- I love making people laugh by doing something funny.
- I always tell my fans that I miss them and love them.
- I am going to sing into my 60s and 70s and 80s, if I can.
- I am no dancer.
- If I have long hair, I go for more... fitting, like a miniskirt dress or a very tight black leather outfit.
- I never really felt 100 percent me while singing in those Jimin years. But I don't regret it, because I think that it was the only time that I can sing those songs, when I was in my early 10s and teens.
- I will strive to achieve my long-term dream.
- I 'follow' some of my fans' social network accounts and take a look at photos and video clips uploaded by them every day. Sometime I ask them to post more adorable and beautiful images of me.
