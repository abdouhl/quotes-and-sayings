- LYou can get yourself cut and stitched, or you can get a good girdle. The day before my first Emmy show, I went to Sears and bought a really good girdle. And I've worn that thing to every single awards show since!
- I was 36 when I got married. I was so focused on, 'You wanted a husband, and you wanted a house, and you wanted children.' I've had all those things now.
- Awards shows are my greatest inducement to get back into shape.
- Once I got both my hips replaced, I could start working out and going Pilates, and it's helped me be more active and youthful.

- When I think of all the years in my 30s when I starved myself... but when I got the role of Lois, I stopped thinking about my looks and was just myself.
- I know I don't want to do another single-camera show. It's so time-consuming. I did a couple of episodes of 'Whitney' as her mom, but I have been laying low. I love being with my kids and being a mom.

- Student teaching is the hardest job there is.
- I was never a glamour puss whose career was really based on a look or an attitude. I've been basically playing the same parts I am at 55 that I was at 35. I get cast as strong women, and that can be a mother or a judge or anything.
- I've got fabulous women friends that I kind of didn't have while I was married. I realized the great need for that when the marriage started to disintegrate.

- You can make sure your kids make their beds and hang up their clothes and put their dishes in the dishwasher when you're the one calling the shots. So, parenting alone, for me anyway, I think is almost easier, being single.
- We did talk about cheese on our first date.
- It was an odd coincidence that my career took off the same decade as having babies. I often wished it had been different, that I had my big career bump in my thirties and my babies in my forties or vice versa.

- I think it's a pretty good day if I can get through it without lifting a finger.
- Croquet is tough. People play for months because the rules are so bizarre. Those crazy English.
- Tennis lets you talk while you're playing.
- My kids have a great dad. I don't really want them to have a stepfather, and I don't think they do, either.
- I like to be with my children - not just quality time, but quantity time. I like to be there in the morning when they're waking up. I like to practice piano with them. I like to be there at supper. I need them as much as they need me. Working is not as important to me as being a mother is.
- For me, there's a big difference between having a baby in your 20s and having a baby in your 40s.
- I'm not going to be on the show 'Breaking Bad.'
- It's wonderful when you can play a character that pulls all sorts of strings inside of you and fills you emotionally.
- Well, I love having kids. But I have the advantage of having a lot of help, a real hands-on husband and small children whom I can easily manipulate.
