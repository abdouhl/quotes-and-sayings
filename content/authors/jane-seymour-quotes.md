- You have to count on living every single day in a way you believe will make you feel good about your life - so that if it were over tomorrow, you'd be content with yourself.
- I definitely believe in a God and in a higher power, and I definitely take from many different religious cultures. I go to church.
- I wanted to be a serious actress rather than a pretty face.
- I love doing comedy. Absolutely love it. After 'Wedding Crashers,' people suddenly realized that it was something I could do.
- At the end of the day, I let myself have a glass of wine.
- I really love the independent movies and I just think that sometimes when they throw a lot of money into it and a lot of special effects and a lot of stunts that you lose the connection, the human connection and I personally love movies that are about the human connection.
- When I started painting 17 years ago, I never imagined that anyone would look at my work or buy my pieces. But now I do about 14 exhibitions each year.
- It's interesting because a lot of my 16-year-old kids' friends know me from 'Wedding Crashers,' and not so much Bond. My kids have a good laugh. I was 20 then. The look I had then was the look that a lot of their friends are assuming now. They think it's cool. What goes around comes around.
- In life, when stuff happens the instinct is to close off your heart. By leaving your heart open, it leaves room for someone else to come in.
- When I was growing up, my mother, who had been through a lot of terrible things in life, taught me that when life is tough your instinct is to close your heart. But if you can accept what happened and reach out to someone, there will always be someone less fortunate, or someone that can bring a solution and help your life.
- When I auditioned for 'Wedding Crashers,' the producers had never seen any of my other work except for Bond. I got 'Wedding Crashers' partly because I was a Bond girl.

- If somebody believes that a certain practice will get them to heaven, and then other people believe a different way of doing it, I think it's their choice.
- I know that the purpose of life is to understand and be in the present moment with the people you love. It's just that simple.
- No, I chose the name Jane Seymour because I was doing my first film, 'Oh! What a Lovely War,' and one of the top agents in England spotted me dancing in the chorus. I was a singer and dancer in that movie with Maggie Smith, um, and he told me he couldn't sell me as Joyce Penelope Willomena Frankenburger.
- Get over jet-lag quickly. I think a lot of people waste the first few days sleeping in the wrong time zone. Sometimes I take melatonin but at other times a glass of wine will do it.
- I think a lot of people get so obsessed with the wedding and the expense of the wedding that they miss out on what the real purpose is. It's not about a production number, it's about a meaningful moment between two people that's witnessed by people that they actually really know and care about.
- Even though I make those movies, I find myself wishing that more of those magic moments could happen in real life.
- When I'm in the U.K. I can't resist Maltesers and Twiglets - the evil combination. Luckily, I live in the U.S. so can't get them easily, which is probably a good thing.
- Being creative is my idea of heaven. I'm just incredibly fortunate that I can do it in artwork. Watercolor is what I started out with. What I love about watercolor is that a lot of happy accidents occur.
- I think the good thing about my face is it has always been expressive. With Botox that goes - not what you want as an actress.
- I don't waste any time at all. I have no time at all for people who are being very negative or people who are very whiny or people who feel sorry for themselves. I tend to go to them and just say, you don't understand how incredible life is and how precious it is.
- I've had two terrific relationships, but both ended in marriage.

- My mother lived in Holland, and during World War II was incarcerated in a Japanese camp for three years.
- People always think that because of 'Dr. Quinn' that I just play nice family stuff. But the truth of the matter is that 'East of Eden' was a very successful thing for me in the past. I've played a lot of very evil people in my time.
- Now that I've experienced ageism, I don't regard it as a bad thing. It's been a transition to something more exciting and maybe edgier.
- The family is inclusive of not just your genetic family, but the people that you meet along the way.
- What I know now is that we're all interconnected and that's a really beautiful thing. We have links to everyone else in our lives and in the world. Different people have different journeys for different reasons. You can't judge, but you can celebrate that there are connections everywhere.
- You cannot do everything at once, so find people you trust to help you. And don't be afraid to say no.
- It's interesting that whenever I meet some of the other Bond girls, I always have something in common, and it is an interesting sorority. We all share about our Bonds. 'Did your Bond do that?' 'Yes mine did!' So it is quite funny conversations. We may as well be in high school.
- When I was younger, I remember thinking, 'I have to pass this mark' or 'I have to get this role' or 'I have to do this or that' and then that will mean I have accomplished something. But life is actually all about the process and not about the goals.
- After my divorce, painting took me out of panic mode and into a serene, calm place. I could absolutely lose myself.

- I spend as much time as I possibly can doing things for other people, if I can. If I see a need and I feel that I can help, I do it. I work a great deal in terms of charities and things.
- I'm proud of my wrinkles. They give my face character. As an actress, you mess with that at your peril.
- I did all the Chef Boyardee commercials, in America, when I was young.
- I find it interesting that 16-year-olds are having plastic surgery. People in their 40s used to think, 'I'm aging, I have to do something about it.' Now children are deciding they don't like the way they look.
- Music has brought me some of the highest moments of my life. I don't even hear the music. I don't even hear the notes. I'm not aware that someone has turned on a tape machine - I'm in another world.
- Every once in a while I go off to do a movie or a television series and I take my art with me. I can stay in character when I paint.
- People say women shouldn't have long hair over a certain age, but I've never done what everyone says.
- And I always think of life like a giant wave. You know, it rises and it crests and it flies, and it's just magnificent, and then it crashes. And for a lot of people, when it crashes, that's the end, and they go down the deep, dark hole of depression.
- I just did a film in which I had to be a dancer and I was able to do all kinds of extraordinary things. A lot of people turn 50 and talk about what they're not going to do anymore. I embarked on something that I'd wanted to do when I was 5.
- People ask me how I keep my figure, and I tell them it's because I paint. When you're covered in paint, it's quite hard to put food in your mouth!
- My Bond character was meant to look like a virgin. I don't think they do that very often.
- I believe that there is some spiritual entity that's greater than us. I do not belong to any specific organized religion. I have always believed that, and I believe it even more so now. I believe that someone was listening to me, and someone is giving me an incredibly blessed life.
- An agent once told me that if I would lose my English accent, I would never stop working in America.
- Motherhood has relaxed me in many ways. You learn to deal with crisis. I've become a juggler, I suppose. It's all a big circus, and nobody who knows me believes I can manage, but sometimes I do.
- I learn my lines while on the golf course. I try to do two or three things at once. I have ideas for books all the time, I have ideas for paintings all the time, and I write them all down. I take my sketchpad and my iPad, which I design on, and I do sit down and do specific tasks at specific times.
- I'm not involved in the politics of religion, but I love what the message is.
- 'Dr. Quinn' came along when I turned 40, so my career actually peaked then.
- I don't let the children watch TV on weeknights. They practice playing musical instruments instead. Both my sons play piano, drums and guitar, so my husband and I listen to them in the evening.
- I had ordered long legs, but they never arrived. My eyes are weird too, one is gray and the other is green. I have a crooked smile and my nose looks like a ski slope. No, I would not win a Miss contest.
