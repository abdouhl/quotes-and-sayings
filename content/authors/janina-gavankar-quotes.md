- I grew up playing classical piano and percussion.
- You're an actor first and foremost. No one is going to hire you because you tweet a lot.
- When I was in college in Chicago, I was doing a lot of commercials - that was my bread and butter.
- I've been really lucky. I think that you really get what you recognize is in the universe.
- I've always done the safest thing, which is to assume that it's going to feel like that, to assume that you're going to feel like a freshman in a group of seniors - if you expect the worst, then it's never going to be that bad.
- I'm always drooling over great design, from fashion to furniture.
- I want to continue to play characters that are not like me at all, and transform.
- I'd rather be with Dracula than the Wolfman.
- I love supernatural stuff. 'Battlestar Galactica' was my favorite show.
- I don't really feel comfortable unless I'm slightly uncomfortable. I don't want to play myself all the time.
- It's ridiculous that people aren't allowed to love who they love, have families, and have the same life as straight people. It's infuriating.
- I always feel like I'm so busy.
- I believe artists deserve all the help they can get, so they can focus on being great artists.
- I want to see what technology's going to be like in a few hundred years, if the human race hasn't completely obliterated itself by then.
- I identify more as a musician than as a singer, because I play piano and percussion, and I engineer and produce everything that I do.
- I'm straight. I. Love. Men. I love men.
- I know that you have to be reserved about certain things in your life.
- I did all the musicals in my high school; I was in a pop group signed to Cash Money Records in college. Music has always been a really big part of my life.
- When it comes down to it, I'm kind of a nerdy actor.
- I was working in Chicago, in theater and in commercials and anything that anybody would let me do. When I moved to L.A., I had made a choice to be a character actor, meaning that I wanted to become somebody else. That's what attracted me to becoming an actor in the first place.
- I can't watch 'Glee' because I get so jealous that I'm not there with them doing it that I can't even watch.
- I feel like in Atlanta, if you were a female dancer, the more you can dance like the boys, the more respect you get. I was thrust into that kind of dance culture, and it was in my body.
- IMDb only lists specific projects. It doesn't list theater, commercial, and most non-union work. You also have to pay to upload your reel to most sites, and some places still make you walk your DVD into their physical location.
- I'd rather control someone than be controlled.
