- You have to go out and find a way to compete every day. I know what I can do and what I can offer the team.
- A lot of people think pitchers, and they just think throwing and that's where all the power comes from. It's really not. It starts from the ground up.

- It's very important to go pitch-by-pitch and game-by-game and not getting too far ahead of myself. In the past, it was trying to make up for a bad game and thinking ahead and what do I have to do to fix this.
- I know my fastball command will get even better.
- Each outing is its own game. You roll on your game plan. It is a different chess match each time you go out there. I just try to be prepared.
- It's hard to learn a new guy each time out there.
- I have always been a hard worker. I had to make some adjustments to find a way to make my delivery crisper and more repeatable.

- You are not always going to have your A game; you might have your D game. You have to find a way to throw strikes no matter what.
- I'm a pro. I understand you check your ego at the door. If you don't have it that night, you don't have it that night. But sometimes you're like, 'Give me that opportunity to grind through this'.
