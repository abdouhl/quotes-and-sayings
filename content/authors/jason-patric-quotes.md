- I don't have a problem with fame. I got into this business intending to be very successful, but I wanted it to be at my price.
- I would never do something like Speed 2 again. If I'd wanted to make those kind of movies I could have signed up for five of them while it was in the can. It wasn't worth it to me. That was just an innocuous, boring movie.
- It's easy to be a movie star. The shoes are already there. They just put you in the shoes.
- I think that's what I really liked about Narc: My character has a real operatic range in a way that older movies used to have.
- Training Day was such a Hollywood movie; I didn't like it.
- If I was coming into the business today, I wouldn't be in it. Knowing what I know, absolutely not.
- I try to stay under the radar.
- I don't like people who use the press to advance themselves in a way that they haven't earned as an actor, performer or director.
- I don't find movies interesting. I just want to do the movies that made me interested in getting into movies, and they're few and far between.
- Pacino's always played the suffering prince. I just find that interesting.
- I have all this time between projects, and I'm not so sure that's a healthy thing. It's scary, because at 36 I'm woefully unqualified for anything else.
- When actors talk about research, they're just patting themselves on the back.
- Now, being on the cover of Vanity Fair is as important as being in great movies. The lines are very, very blurred.
- You can take a handful of dollars, a good story, and people with passion and make a movie that will stand up against any $70 million movie.
- I made three movies in 1995 and I was unhappy with all of them: Sleepers, Incognito, and Speed 2.
- Everybody acts like they're in a movie in most movies. That's why they stink.
- It's interesting to help someone find their vocabulary. There would not have been a De Niro without a Scorsese.
- I have a problem with the blatant celebrity exhibitionism that happens in this business and being sold purely as a brand.
- I was making a lot of independent movies before the independent movement.
- You know how many movies it took Tom Cruise before he was making 5, 6 million dollars? It probably took a billion dollars in box office.
- I never turned down a movie because they wouldn't give me enough money.
- I think The Exorcist is the best American horror movie ever made. Friedkin was at the top of his game.
- Mostly I do films that mainstream Hollywood wouldn't touch.
- I really tried to make movies I wanted to see. I thought that if I was good enough, somebody would always need me.
- When you look at some of the most respected actors there are and the crap that they're in... it didn't used to be that way.
