- I've certainly auditioned for big budget studio films. I don't know if it's because there's so much money involved, but a lot of times the pressure overwhelms me and engulfs me. I end up falling apart in the audition.
- I like being challenged. That's the only way you grow.
- Fake relationships and fake people coming up to me and all of a sudden wanting to be my friend.
- I'm always frightened away by movies that lower the bar on our endeavor to learn more about the crazy weird creatures that we are.
- I never get tired of smiling. I'm just the kind of guy who likes to smile.
- Even if I tried to be my dad, it would be a mediocre, slightly embarrassing version.
- There's a few conspiracy theories that I believe in, but not too many.
- I knew I really made it when my dad saw me in London and after the performance he had no notes to me and just said 'You are doing your own thing and I am proud of you.'
- One of the fun things as an actor is to find a character that if you were to look up a rap sheet about them, you might say, 'I don't really necessarily want to hang out with this guy' or 'I would never be this kind of guy in my life.' I think it's part of an actor's job to say, 'Maybe you could be.'
- I do exercises on my Wii. It's nice to have games that keep you active. It's an excuse to play video games.
- Both men and women are really vast and boundless and yet in many films we're told that they're not. We're told they can only be one thing - like handsome and charming and that's it. Nothing more.
- I love the feeling of having as close to a steady job as you can ever have as an actor. I'm not an extravagant spender, so when I work on a TV show for a season or do a bunch of episodes as a reoccurring, I try to spread the money that comes from that out so that I can do these movies that are important to me.
- I feel like sometimes people on television shows can start taking things for granted, or they don't want to be here or something like that.
- Acting is a craft, and you need to study to be an actor.
- I think I would cope like anyone copes with any tragedy. I'm sure I would be very upset for a while and then there would come a point where I would either have to stay in this place of darkness and anger, or I'd have to accept that it happened.
- The only reason I ever do an independent film is that I believe in it, and I think it has something special to offer. I'm certainly not doing it to be a millionaire.
- A lot of times I would go into a room and audition for whatever sitcom it was and they would expect me to do sort of what my dad was doing and I am not him so they would be disappointed and I would feel nervous and not know exactly how to do it.
- I don't think my spirituality has affected my character. I feel like my character is much more cynical about his beliefs, and I think I have to kind of drop what I believe in order to play him.
- I'm a bit too much of a people pleaser and that can be frustrating for people in your life.
- I think as far as I've been able to understand from my friends that I went to college with and things like that is that it almost seems like Russian Roulette when you're coming out of the closet to your parents.
- I spend a fair amount of time on my computer, but I don't hack into anything. I have to open the manual and follow instructions.
- There's something about being rejected - when I go out without my friends, I'm reminded of how I'm actually quite antisocial. I don't look like a guy who feels like that, but it's very hard for me to start up a conversation. At a party, I'm lost.
- I think one of the reasons that we like conspiracy theories is I think that we like to feel like there is a group of people who are so smart and powerful that they can pull the wool over an entire country or in fact even an entire world's eyes. That certainly makes us feel like somehow we're protected, even if it's not in our best interest.
- Your fears never go away. You just get more comfortable ignoring them.
- I love doing television.
- I don't have to have any special skills or martial arts in my back pocket.
- I think at a certain point actors need to start taking responsibility for the kinds of stories they want to tell.
