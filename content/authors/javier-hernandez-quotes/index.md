- I think every national team has the same possibilities to win the World Cup.
- You play this sport in the mind, not only on the field.
- It was the case that I wanted to go. Not because I don't like West Ham, but because I need to have minutes on the pitch.
- I always want my old clubs to do well. But I have only one love in my life in football - my home club Chivas, in Guadalajara. The other clubs are my girlfriends.
- I think every footballer in the world wants to be on the pitch as much as possible.
- At the end, what do you prefer? To play beautifully and stay in the same place, the round of 16, or play ugly and reach a semifinal?
- I'm a person who cannot be doing nothing. I have a deficit. In Mexico, we say 'hiperactivo' - hyperactive. I am hyperactive!
- Why can't we be Greece in the Euros? Why can't we be Leicester in the Premier League? Tell me why not.
- I'm very lucky to go back to my old club, my old home, my old house. To start my new chapter in this second part of my life in the Premier League is going to be something happy. I have very good memories from those four years in Manchester.

- If you want to win the World Cup, you need to play against the best national teams in the world.
- I'm never going to be in a comfort zone. I always want to be a better player, person. I want to help my team get the goals that we are aiming for.
- That's soccer. There are good games and others that aren't so much.
- If you're inside the box and a cross is coming, sometimes you need, as we say in Spanish, to smell the intuition, to smell where the cross is going.
- How does it feel? Really, I don't know because I never try to feel more or less than any player in Leverkusen or Mexico. I don't feel like I'm more famous than other players; I'm just one more footballer who wants to achieve their dreams and to try to help their team as much as they can to do that.
- What I miss most about Mexico isn't the food or the customs; it's my family and the way we'd all sit around chatting together.
- Words can come and go. Your acts are going to speak for themselves.
- The most important thing is to have opportunities and feel confidence in yourself.
- Moving to a new country is always difficult, but the fact my dad and my sister came to live with me was a huge help. That made things easier.
- I spoke with Van Gaal, and he said that I only had a one per cent chance of playing in my position, so I headed to Bayer.
- I'm so grateful to Ferguson. I think he's the best there's ever been, especially his squad management skills.
- I felt the same when I went to Manchester United, to Madrid, to Leverkusen, and now at West Ham. The only pressure I have is my pressure. That's it.
- On crosses, sometimes I make my move one or two seconds before the ball is coming because I'm trying to guess that the ball is coming there. It's intuition. So I run. Sometimes the ball comes...sometimes not. But that intuition is working.
