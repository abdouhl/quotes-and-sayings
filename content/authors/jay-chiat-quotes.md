- First, this isn't about telecommuting, because we still have offices that people will come to regularly when they need to brainstorm together, meet with clients, or do research in the library.

- I like the Gap ad, the khaki one. I liked that.
- The team architecture means setting up an organization that helps people produce that great work in teams.

- Research we've done seems to indicate that people who are on the Net like the idea that they don't have to leave what they are reading to go buy something.
- Taking risks gives me energy.
- One is that that's the way we started and we thought there would be more value and less confusion if the business model was just based on delivering news that's of value to Web sites.
- If you really think about it, when watching television, you have product placement all the time.
- Transferring successfully to the next generation means producing work that's as good as or better than the work of the first generation that founded the agency.
- We don't have titles on our business cards. No one really gets any special treatment. No one gets a corner office to put pictures of their family and their dog in.
- Our technology is very scalable. Our software can accommodate enormous numbers of clients. It's a marvelous opportunity. We'll keep developing products.
- Fire has impacted every part of our lives - without fire, there would be no shopping, right? - that's how the Internet will intrude on our lives, particularly our kids' lives.
- I can't say the advertising model is obsolete yet but it doesn't make a lot of sense in the long range.
- You come to work because the office is a resource: The office is a place where you can meet with other people, and the office has libraries of books and information on CD-ROM that might help you with your work.
