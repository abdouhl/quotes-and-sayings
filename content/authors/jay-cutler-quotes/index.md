- I want to be on a successful team, and I know that paying one or two or three players premium hurts your chances of being able to bring in extra talent.
- Because I don't produce insulin, I have to put insulin into my body, which means that I have a pen with a needle on it. I have it with me. You have to stick it in your thigh, or your arm - a lot of different spots you can put it.
- As I get older and maybe a little bit wiser, you realize how much stuff affects your body and what it can do. Cutting out carbs and sweets and trying to eat just proteins and fruits and stuff like that, more natural stuff, is what I have found has had the biggest impact on me.
- Diabetes is all about insulin levels and sugar levels and what you put in your body.
- You eat as many vegetables as you can, and try to cut your carbs and your sugar. That's going to make the job of being a diabetic so much easier.
- You get to a point in your career, I think, it's not even about money. You're secure. You want to win Super Bowls.
- It's hard enough as a kid these days to feel normal and just try to fit in. To be a diabetic is just a dramatic thing to go through.
- The more you put in your body, the more you have to regulate it with insulin. So later kickoffs, you're talking about breakfast, lunch and a pregame meal, so that's more food you've got to be aware of and what you put in your body. A noon game, light breakfast, a little fruit and some insulin, and I'm good to go.
