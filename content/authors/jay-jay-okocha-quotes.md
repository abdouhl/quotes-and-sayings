- If you score goals late on it's not the sign of a lucky team, it's the sign of a fit team who are close together and fight for each other.

- Messi and Ronaldo have dominated world football for a decade and, given the nature of football, at a certain point the baton will have to pass to someone else. I think Neymar has a great chance of filling that role.
- I've wanted to be a part of the Premiership for some time, to experience the excitement and the atmosphere.
- Traditionally it's been difficult for Africans to play over here, mainly because the African calendar is very different to that in Europe. Most of the coaches over here can't accept that we have to go back home to play at the Nations' Cup for a month while the season is still on over here. That made people reluctant to sign Africans.
- I can proudly say that I had no scandal throughout my career. And there was no serious injury worries because of what I was taught how to live off the pitch. It was very important.
- I'd say the player whose style most resembles mine would be Neymar. That's because I played with a sense of joy and you can see that he feels the same and really enjoys his own play. He doesn't play for himself or just to entertain the fans - he plays for his team. He uses his quality and skill for the good of the team.
- I got to Germany without being scouted, and without any experience of playing for my country. But I was given the chance to excel.

- I was gifted with the ball, and I saw the opportunity of playing in the Bundesliga as the tool I needed to make a name for myself.
- Aboutrika has done well with Egypt, winning the Nations Cup in Ghana, as well as helping Ahly win the Champions League for a record sixth time.
- I knew I was in charge when with the ball. But on the toughest defenders I faced, I would say that my African brothers were the ones. We have the same mentality and thought the same way. Osei Kuffour was the toughest of them all.

- I experienced life in a struggling team at Eintracht Frankfurt, but I was still young then and didn't understand what it meant to be relegated.

- Education from six-year-old to 14 is compulsory in Nigeria, but the simple fact is that a lack of resources, coupled with peoples' inability to afford books and uniforms mean the reality for millions of Nigerian children is a life without education.

- I don't walk around with a bible or preach to people and I don't want to disturb my team-mates on match days by praying in the dressing room, so I do that at the hotel before I leave. I respect their way of life and do not insist that my way is best. I have not tried to convert anybody.
- I pray a lot and it has helped me throughout my whole career to stay calm and focused.
