- Everybody is going to love me and this is not being cocky - this is just what I see.
- If you hear a good song, it makes you hopeful like, 'That is out there.'
- I put my emotions in my music and I want people to relate to that.
- I loved the feeling I got when I sang. I loved the feeling that it gave to people when I sang.
- I'm not the type of woman who shows off my body; I'm a vocalist and I'm a writer and I think people see that more so than they see anything else. That's just who I am.
- I'm cool with where I'm at. It's certain things I wanna do to be better, but I'm good.
- I feel that the music that I do is somewhat of a lost art and it's not as popular as dance or pop music and people are not as interested in it. But it's something that I believe in and I feel that it's needed, so that's why I do it and I will keep doing it until everybody hears it and gets it.
