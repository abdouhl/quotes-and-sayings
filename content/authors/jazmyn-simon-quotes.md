- I hit the jackpot in love.
- I have a list of people to work with, but Marvel is really at the top of that list because I've been working out really hard and just waiting for that day they tell me I can slide into a spandex suit!
- I love work, but love is so much better. Love is the best.
- My first job out of college was with HBO. I worked in a small sales office in Chicago. So, I can say that even when I was just a little, low-on-the-totem-pole assistant for HBO, they were always amazing.
- I went to college for communications, so I came out and said I wanted to work for the greatest communications company, and I ended up at HBO - and I couldn't have been happier. And now, as an actress, I wound up back at HBO - and they truly are the best.
- It's very important to get facials. Facials and sunscreen - people don't believe that black people need sunscreen, but sunscreen with save your life.
- I drive a Prius, but I dream of the Tesla.
- I never go to bed with makeup on.
- Everyone deserves to laugh for at least 30 minutes, and 'Ballers' gives you that.
- Smiling makes a huge difference. A lot of people walk the red carpet and try to be sexy. I don't do that; I always smile.
- When we're not shooting 'Ballers,' we're always on the hunt for other work. As actors, we've never satisfied with just one thing.
- I'm so grateful. I count my blessings every day.
- I tell anyone who is willing to listen that auditioning is the hardest part. Once you get the job, you have the job. You can go to work. You learn your lines. You learn your character. With auditioning, you can have five in a week with different people.
- I like to tell people that 'Ballers' has something for everyone. If you are a football fan, then obviously, 'Ballers' is the way to go. The series are using real team names so that's a plus. If you have no interest in football, it's still a show about life, and there's something for everybody on that show.
