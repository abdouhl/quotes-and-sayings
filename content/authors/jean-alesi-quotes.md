- When you drive a car, either you manage it and feel it with the grip of the car, or, like me, you fix it on visual speed. If you do it through the grip, you lose it very quickly - because when the track changes, you can have scares. I do it visually, so if I am going too fast I fight to get the car back, but I do not do it by feeling the grip.

- When you are in a good position you are sure to drive well and to be very concentrated in each corner.
- I must use Ferrari to the maximum. My priority is to get results. Then we will see what happens.
- I was quite excited, but I was sure I wouldn't win the race. I am a realist.
- I am not close to retirement. I still have a lot more that I can achieve. There are younger guys coming into F1, but I am not old and I'm not finished.

- You tend to think that there is a big gap between F1 and everything else. F1 is where all the fantastic drivers are, so you just don't know how good you are until you get there.
- That was my dream, to drive for Ferrari, but I am not a kid any more. If Ferrari is the best team and if I get the chance to drive for Ferrari, it would be with pleasure.
- F1 teams need a driver who will consistently set lap times that are 100 percent on the edge.
- It wasn't all frustration. I've had a lot of good times with Ferrari as well.
- I will be better in Monte Carlo than I was in Phoenix. If I can't win maybe I will lead 50 laps.
- My contract is just for this year, but I have an option for next year. It is not signed at this moment, but I am only concentrating on this year. I don't know exactly what I will do in the future.
- Experience has taught me that you have to improve all the time-little bit by little bit-and not keeping starting everything from new.
- I have never won a race, and that is my main disappointment - but you have to be positive.
- When I go back to France now I spend all the my time with press and sponsors. I do not have a lot of time to spend at home with my family.
- I am a professional. At the circuit I am calm. At home I am very different.
- I think I will have a lot of opportunities in the future.
- I made my choice to be in Ferrari. It is not easy because it is important for a man to have satisfaction. And for me to get the satisfaction I want means getting results.
- Eddie Jordan found me all the drives. If I am with Tyrrell today, it is because Eddie was there.
