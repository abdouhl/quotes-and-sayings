- The populists themselves are dangerous, but they are far more dangerous when the traditional, classic parties adopt their harmful proposals.
- The rule of law means that law and justice are upheld by an independent judiciary. The judgments of the European Court of Justice have to be respected by all. To undermine them, or to undermine the independence of national courts, is to strip citizens of their fundamental rights. The rule of law is not optional in the European Union. It is a must.
- If we allow Catalonia - and it is none of our business - to separate, others will do the same. I do not want that.
- My main concern is to protect people from detriment.
- The European Union has decades of experience in overcoming crises and has always emerged stronger after.
- From the very beginning, Europe has been not only a success story but also a story of success achieved by learning.
- Forgetting the importance of national landscapes, cultures, national behaviours, reactions, and reflexes is a big, big mistake.

- God understands more about the financial markets than many who write about them.
- The populists are spreading slogans. We have to offer solutions and answers.
- However painful or regrettable Brexit may be, it will not stop the E.U. as it moves to the future; we need to move forward.
- Our idea is to make the U.K. a privileged partner of the E.U.
- We do not attract Russian money to Luxembourg with high interest rates.
- Of course Brexit means that something is wrong in Europe. But Brexit means also that something was wrong in Britain.
- If someone complains about Europe from Monday to Saturday, then nobody is going to believe him on Sunday when he says he is a convinced European.
- We shouldn't persuade people that we can simply conjure up the sun and the moon: at the most, we can deliver a telescope.
- The European family may well be anything but perfect. But it is the best thing that we have for bringing the countries of Europe around the same table and for forging compromises so that people here can live in peace, freedom, and prosperity.
- I am not a dwarf.
- Europe must not distance itself from Africa's universal ambitions.
- This was a continent of divisions, of wars, of conflicts, of divergences, differences... When I am in Asia, in Africa, people admire what we have managed to do. Europe is beautiful seen from other continents.
- As complicated and complex and as difficult as we are, the unity of Europe is a pre-condition for a better organized world, and if the European Union would fail or decompose, or other members left, the U.S. would have a more difficult role to play in the world.
- Being described as a stupid bureaucrat with no link to representative democracy is difficult to take.
- Anyone who believes that the eternal question of war and peace in Europe is no longer there risks being deeply mistaken.
- It is not acceptable that European Union countries are divided into those who give and those who take.
- In a union of equals, there can be no second-class consumers. I will not accept that in some parts of Europe, people are sold food of lower quality than in other countries, despite the packaging and branding being identical.
- In 1913 many believed that there would never again be a war in Europe. The great powers of the continent were so closely intertwined economically that the view was widespread that they could no longer afford to have military confrontations.
- Europe has to be about more than market, goods, and money.
- I believe that if we don't offer legal ways of emigrating to Europe and immigrating within Europe, we will be lost.

- I am against nationalists, but I am very much in favour of patriots.
- The U.K. decided to leave the E.U. - Brexit means Brexit.
- No, we should not be afraid of the populists; we should embrace those they are fighting.
- We decide on something, leave it lying around, and wait and see what happens. If no one kicks up a fuss, because most people don't understand what has been decided, we continue step by step until there is no turning back.
