- I leave everyone to have their own opinions of my music and my influence - or not - on others.
- When I began making electronic music, the only thing I was thinking about was creating music that I really liked. I didn't think about what effect it would have; I was busy doing it.
- For me, electronic music is the classical music of the 21st century.
- Governments can help support European music by promoting public awareness that when people take music that doesn't belong to them, they undermine the future of those very artists whose work they enjoy.
- Dance fascinates me, and it is perhaps the most enriching audio-visual realm for a musician. Film-making also fascinates me.
- At the time, 'Oxygene' was considered a totally 'far out' concept... What was 'in' at the time was disco, hard-rock, and the early days of punk... and moreover, 'Oxygene' was instrumental. And I was French!
- I want the Dead Sea, like Masada, to be part of UNESCO's world heritage.
- This project, 'Electronica,' is about working with people who are a strong source of inspiration to me.
- I had no precise plan when I started 'Electronica,' but I think it has been a very positive journey for me.
- It's sometimes better to have a father figure to rebel against than nothing, than just a black hole or an absence.
- The major rock instruments and classical instruments were designed for performance, for sharing the music with an audience, and then later people put microphones on them and recorded them. But for electronic music, the opposite was true - they're designed in laboratories, and later, we tried to put them on stage.
- I remember, for my fifth birthday, Chet Baker sat me on the upright piano, and he played just for me for a few minutes. I can still remember the pressure of the air on my chest. It was my first physical contact with sound.
- I feel very privileged to have played China, and the pyramids, all these fantastic places, but it created a kind of smoke curtain between the audience and me as a musician.
- Early music in all kinds of movements is always a mixture of innocence and ambition.
- When I did the first 'Oxygene' in the vinyl days, I had a structure in mind divided in 2 parts fitting the A&B sides of an album.
- With electronic music, you are not confined to the acoustics of a concert-hall, and that inspired me to bring my performances outdoors.
- Music, photography, media, film - it's all going to be free on the Internet. We have to accept it.
- 'Oxygene' was one of the first, if not the first, popular electronic music album.
- If music is to continue to support the livelihoods of artists, it cannot be taken without the permission of artists.
- With the violin, for example, one understands culturally that the sound comes from the instrument that can be seen. With electronic music, it is not the same at all. That's why it seemed so important to me, from the beginning of my career, to invent a grammar, a visual vocabulary adapted to electronic music.
- Suddenly, we are putting ourselves as the next dinosaurs. It's rather dark; we have narrowed our dreams. It is time to restore our visions. And so it's not a nostalgic idea; it is based with this unconscious need to restore a kind of dynamic for tomorrow.
- For me, electronic music is like cooking: it's a sensual organic activity where you can mix ingredients.
- I have played a few times in Barcelona, including the fantastic Olympic Stadium. It's undoubtedly one of my favourite cities in terms of the people, arts, food, architecture and design.
- The whole 'Electronica' project is about the ambiguous relationship we have with technology: on the one side, we have the world in our pocket; on the other, we are spied on constantly.
- From the outside, being an artist seems like a dream life, but there are much darker aspects to it.
- I did the first 'Oxygene' on an 8 tracks tape recorder with very few instruments, with no other choice than being minimalist.
- People don't realize enough how important and influentical John Carpenter has been in electronic music. He did his soundtracks by himself, using mostly electronic and analog synthesizers. He's a cult figure with DJs these days for good reasons.
- Think about when you listen to a song on the radio. You are not paying for it; it's not illegal to do it, because the rights have been paid for on top, beforehand, by the radio station, by the network. We have to find exactly the same kind of system with the Internet.
- People are rejecting the power of the elite, but individuals such as Snowden are doing so in a positive way, trying to change things for the better. He is a very intelligent man and obviously interested in electronic music.
- When you think after 25 years of Mao, Chinese people had no idea about western music or even western culture. They had no idea about James Dean or the Beatles or Charlie Chaplin, modern music or modern cinema.
- We have lost our vision for the future. Before, we say, 'Nothing will be the same. Cars will fly, and we go to the end of the universe.' We have this kind of naive but exciting idea of the future. Now, the vision has been reduced to ways to select our garbage and how to survive global warming.
- When I was at the Group for Musical Research, with this idea of discovering electronic music, I quickly realized that that it was a very interesting and exciting approach to music, but I also saw that it was very intellectual and quite dogmatic.
- Saying that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about freedom of speech because you have nothing to say.
- Emotions are the basics of any art form!
- Back in the Seventies, we had a romantic, poetic vision of the future, like it was in the movie '2001: A Space Odyssey.' It felt as if everything was still ahead of us.
- My first break was in my home country with some pop songs that became hits, writing for French singers Christophe & Francoise Hardy, which became hits.
- My first synthesizer was the VCS3. I got it in Bristol in the late Sixties, long before Pink Floyd used them. I had to sell an acoustic guitar and an old reel-to-reel tape recorder to raise the money. You can do fantastic things with modern computers, but you cannot use them in the same intuitive, spontaneous way you can a VCS3.
- Some collaborators might join forces in certain cities or special concerts. I'm excited to share the stage with some prestigious people that I love and respect.
- We should never forget that in the smartphone, the smart part is us creators.
- What is important to me is that the world understand that the problems of the Dead Sea concern not only residents of the region but humanity.
- I consider music like a mirage in the desert. You're obsessed with the ideal piece of music, and the more you think you're getting closer, it's not there.
- Our senses have changed, even though our emotions have not.
- I think that in any language when you have a real relationship, and there is love and respect between people, infidelity is always something difficult to accept - whether you are Chinese, British, French. I think that is a universal concept... or problem.
- When I compose an album, I don't think about how to adapt it on stage.
- I wanted to create a bridge between experimental music and pop.
- Pursuing music eats into your life to the point where there is no space left for anything else. You are lucky if you find a partner who is able to understand that, but even then, they will only understand it for a while, and then things get - you know, difficult.
- I wanted to find a bridge between Musique Concrete, electro-acoustic music, and proper rock music.
- As a musician, I have always strived for my albums and live performance to render a sound as close as possible to perfection.
- In my opinion, British women are more romantic than French ones.
- Most of the time, when you are in the studio, you are revealing yourself; you're a bit naked. You can express your weaknesses, your awkward way of approaching sound. Sharing these intimate moments is like inviting somebody into your private room.
- Music is the backbone of my shows.
- I am not someone who is afraid; I am someone who reasons.
- I used to play in rock bands. Then I went to the first school of electronic music in the world. It was in Paris headed by one of the most important people involved in electronic music.
- I'm convinced that the earth is much stronger than us.
- I was recently realizing that I've probably spent 80 percent of my life in studios! It's very difficult to do that and still have a private life; it's very difficult to do anything else.
- When I heard Edward Snowden's story, it reminded me of my mother in a strange way. She was in the French resistance from early on, 1941. At that time, the Resistance were considered troublemakers - even traitors - in France.
- Electronic musicians are quite like writers or painters. They are quite isolated in their home studios. We often don't have that the opportunity to collaborate with that many people, like in rock or jazz.
- People who do music do it because it is all they can do. And that's me, I suppose. I can do nothing else.
- The difference between noise and music is in what the musician does with the sounds.
- I understand more when I travel why people believe that the French are arrogant.
- I would say to anyone starting out that if their priority in life is happiness, then don't be a musician.
- One of the first things I created was music for the Paris opera's ballet troupe. That was the first time that electronic music was played at the opera. I really like the relationship between the music and the choreography.
- The value of streaming platforms is estimated at a few billion dollars, and creators can only afford a pizza without pepperoni at the end of the year with the revenues. Without musicians, all those platforms wouldn't exist, so we urgently need an appropriate and sustainable business model for musicians for the 21st century.
- I thought we had opposite visions of electronic music. Tangerine Dream and Kraftwerk had a very robotic, mechanical approach. I had a more impressionist vision - a Ravel/Debussy approach.
- What may not have value to you today may have value to an entire population, entire people, an entire way of life tomorrow. And if you don't stand up for it, then who will?
- The characteristic of 'Oxygene' is a mixture of innocence and ambition, of trying to do something different in a different way.
- I was always interested in mixing experimentation with pop music, and Brian Eno, Kraftwerk, Tangerine Dream - we were all doing it at the same time, just very isolated from each other, all in our different cellars, in different worlds, without the Internet - underground in every sense.
- To me, the original VCS3 synthesizer is like a Stradivarius.
- Snowden has demonstrated true love for his country. He has done something to improve the lives of people.
- I have always been of the opinion that when those in power are promoting actions and ideals that risk harming or impeding us, people should stand up to this.
- When I first heard Kraftwerk, I thought they were an American band singing in German.
- CDs are not as good as vinyl, and you buy one in the supermarket along with the yoghurt.
- All those ethereal string sounds on 'Oxygene IV' come from the VCS3. It was the first European synthesizer, made in England by a guy called Peter Zinoviev. I got one of the first ones.
- My father and I never really achieved a real relationship. We probably saw each other 20 or 25 times in our lifetime.
- We all think we are connected to the world now, but we are not talking to our neighbours any more.
- In electronic music, staying behind your laptop for two hours is not too exciting to watch.
- Generation after generation, there is this never-ending, contemptuous, condescending attitude to the next generation or the next way of thinking: music, art, politics, whatever. And I have never been like that.
- My mother, who was in the Resistance in the Second World War, passed away at 96, and it was like she was 60. I almost have to apologise for my genes.
- Creative industries are more important than the car industry, luxury jewels, and fashion.
- In a lifetime, you can say, yes, you have instances of pleasure, of happiness, you like some of your work, but your work is the entire story, and if you are not satisfied with a few moments of a few parts of that story, you would like to be able to adjust that.
- I've always been involved in the visual aspect of my work, and moreover, it's very important in days where technology allows us to push the boundaries even more than when I started out.
- Even if we artists are all very privileged, there's a constant frustration about how to do more or better, and never being satisfied.
- What is very interesting when talking about electronic music is that - I would say that rock and roll is called the ethnic music born in America that invaded the world. Electronic music is certainly kind of ethnic music born in countries like Germany and France that has invaded the world.
- Peace is neutral, and not very sexy.
- If you get rid of music, images, videos, words and literature from the smartphone, you just have a simple phone that would be worth $50.
- Sometimes, you try something, and it works in terms of success. That doesn't mean you like what is a hit. Sometimes you like the most obscure song on your album.
- I studied classical music in the Conservatory of Paris.
- I don't necessarily like anniversaries that much.
- Bands like Kraftwerk and Tangerine Dream, who I respect, have a very robotic, dehumanised approach. They're almost an apology for machines. It's very German.
- I collect robots. They're mainly Japanese, American, and especially Russian - small robots, big robots, and old toy robots made between 1910 and the Fifties.
- The paradox is that Mark Zuckerberg, Steve Jobs, and all the tech giants are bigger fans of music than some of the executives working at major record companies.
- I always dreamed, when I started writing music, to find a way of immersing yourself in it.
- I was obsessed with the idea that no two sounds on 'Oxygene' should ever be exactly the same. I wanted a heartbeat feel, something human.
- Technology is neutral, but it all depends on the way we use it.
- Technology does not always rhyme with perfection and reliability. Far from it in reality!
- When you have a young man, I mean, questioning the power in place for love of his country, not to say 'stop' but to say 'be careful about the abuse of technology,' I think it deserves to be promoted.
- I just had one occasion in my life when suddenly my private life was everywhere, and that was an accident and beyond my control.
