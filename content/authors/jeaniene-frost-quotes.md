- Similarities in the vampire genre are so rampant that there's really no such thing as an original idea - only an original take on an idea that's been done before.
- One of my favorite things about supernatural fiction is its vast array of creatures.
- Paranormal fiction offers authors - and readers - the chance to answer the question, 'What if?' All the different ways that question can be answered make for extremely entertaining reading.
- I love the 'Underworld' movies because the vampires aren't automatically evil, yet neither are they basically humans with fangs.
- The 'Broken Destiny' series will be a trilogy, with each book releasing about a year apart.
- The paranormal bad boy is usually a fiercely loyal partner for the heroine. Once his sights are set on her, he doesn't notice other women, and he's utterly unconcerned with what anyone else thinks of his choice.
- When I started writing about vampires, I swore that I wouldn't touch the 'Dracula' legend because it's been done too many times.
- The appeal of the paranormal bad boy - or James Bond super-spy, as one example of male escapism - can sometimes make everyday problems seem less dire. Thus, a few hours spent immersed in the world of the wicked yet alluring hero is the equivalent of a mini-vacation.
- Vampires, werewolves, fallen angels and fairies lurk in the shadows, their intentions far from honorable.
- Every so often, I'll get an idea from a dream, but most of the time, ideas come to me while I'm toiling away at the keyboard just like every other writer.
- Perhaps some of the appeal of the dangerous-but-yummy paranormal anti-hero lies in his scorn for societal expectations. Yes, women have come a long way, but there are still some cultural stigmas more associated with women than men.
- My parents were dismayed by my love of horror movies as a young girl, then even more dismayed when I kept rooting for Dracula to win instead of Van Helsing.
