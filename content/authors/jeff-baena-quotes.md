- I don't know if it's because my sensitivity is through the roof, but I can't stand contrived dialogue anymore.
- Not to be negative, but I think the biggest lesson is don't trust anyone.
- I don't like the idea of seeing a movie and it feels comfortable because you've heard it before.
- Comedy is all about rhythm and context, and there's all types of comedies, and it's about finding that right brand, that consistency in tone.
- You can't avoid being an egotistical person and ultimately somewhat narcissistic. You can try to curb it by recognizing that behavior. But at the same time, your repetitive behavior has its own psychology, and it's impossible to get out of that.
- If it feels like you're aiming for something too familiar, and you're not having a primary new experience, then what's the point of making that movie? It's been done before, so try to find something new out of it.
- It's life, so you're a constant evolution of tragedies and achievements and ups and downs. You can probably get a little bit more immune to things, but whatever is the most amount of pain you feel at any given moment feels like the most amount of pain you'll ever feel.
- If something's really selfless, then there's really no value in it for you... there's only value in it for the world.

- My pet peeve is when people criticize things when they're just trying to have a conversation.
- I usually just do, like, studio jobs, re-writes and stuff.
- You show a movie to your friends when you're working on it, but you don't have any real objectivity. You just don't know. So that moment when it's shown for the very first time at Sundance, it's just terrifying. I'm so anxious. And then every screening is different.
- After doing 'Life After Beth,' which I think had one line that wasn't scripted, everything was scripted so that it sounds natural, and I went to such great lengths to create dialogue and to come across the way that people wouldn't sound like they were on the nose.
- Everything kind of has a message in it.
- I always knew I wanted to make movies since I was around eleven. I never thought of it as wanting to do straight-up comedy. Even now, I don't see things in terms of genre.
- I think one of the bigger issues with modern-day people is that we don't give enough credit to people from history as being real. We almost treat them as these rarified beings that didn't exist the way that we do with emotions and urges and drives.

- I grew up in suburbia, so it's a world I'm familiar with... but in my experience, all the families that I grew up thinking were the perfect families who kept it together... all their secrets would come out, and it'd be something dark and disgusting beneath the surface, so I wanted to exploit that.
- When people are committed to things, and the world view they have is no longer in alignment with our world view, then it becomes funny.

- In Judaism, the temple was the most holy site in the world. But if you extend that argument as a metaphor, and you say 'The world is a holy place,' and you're treating this holy place like a money-lending psycho, then Jesus says, 'This is hypocrisy!' and he'd point it out and flip it over.
- For me, the whole idea of performance is not being self-aware, and then sort of just experiencing.

- When you are a writer, the assist-to-turnover ratio... there are a lot more turnovers than assists.
- When you have new people coming in and you sort of want to show them the ropes, it's always easier to have people that know the process and are able to sort of just do their thing, and then everyone can kind of follow their lead.

- In my mind, if you went back to the Middle Ages, in Italy they'd be speaking Middle Age Italian. And at that point, it would obviously be indecipherable for us, but for the people of that time, it was just normal talking.
- For us, when we think about the Middle Ages, it's sort of this rarefied, distant time that we have no connection to, especially if you grew up in America.
- I remember when I was in film school. It was my second year, and some kid did - had this really over-religious symbolism; like, it said 'John 3:16' and had angels falling over, and it was just this insane - it wasn't that great.

- I've been a writer for years, but it was mainly as a function of trying to be a director, so I just got work as a writer. I want to keep directing.
- I wanted to do something a little bit more feminine after my second movie, 'Joshy,' which was so masculine.
- I like collaborating with actors. I love finding that moment where it all comes together.
- My first job after graduating was working with Robert Zemeckis. I got a job a week after graduating and moving to L.A. So I got to work on 'What Lies Beneath' and 'Castaway' as a PA, which is basically like a gopher.

- 'Motherwort.' 'Great Leopard's Bane.' These are awesome band names.
