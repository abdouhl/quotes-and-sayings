- There was something missing. But in my world, there is never time to figure out what is, in fact, missing.

- You can't live in Orange County and train in Thousand Oaks. OK? you just can't. Not with the hours we put in. We have to be on time.
- I couldn't identify just one, but there's numerous rule changes and points of emphasis that have reflected a change on the field almost immediately.

- I've been a Rams fan for so long.
- There's obviously a push to protect the quarterback, but you have to give the defensive players a chance. All of the quarterback has to do is pull the ball, and he's a runner. How's the defender going to know if the ball is pulled or not?
- Having grown up there, my dad in 1967 took me to the Rams-Eagles game, and I've been a Rams fan since I was a kid.
- Typically, there's about 20, 25 percent turnover every year. So, every three or four years with the exception of, as is the case with the Patriots and the quarterback, you have a roster turnover.
