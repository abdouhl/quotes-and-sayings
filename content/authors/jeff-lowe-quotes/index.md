- I think part of my business problems stemmed from a feeling that I had to be more than a good climber, that I had to do something more 'meaningful.' And that may come from my father.
- I may have had some symptoms as early as 1998 - dizziness, vision problems, balance. Anyway, it's been a progression, it hasn't stopped since I first noticed it. Each year there is a considerable decline.
- Climbing is wildly diverse, ranging from the rock-climbing wall at the local health club to the cutting edge of major Himalayan Alpine ascents.

- I used to think that my business mirrored my climbing - if I wasn't failing at something, I just wasn't trying anything hard enough.
- More than five decades of hands grated by cracks. Whole body aching from long days of big-wall hauling. Tiny tents, bivy sacs, snow caves lashed by hurricane sleet. Frozen fingers and toes. Migraines and altitude malaise. Not knowing what's to come. It doesn't have to be fun to be fun.

- I've always pushed my body way too hard, gone days without eating at 20,000 feet, and caught every exotic bug that didn't kill me.
- I will still probably die of aspiration-caused pneumonia. I can go along breathing well, then I might aspirate on something, develop pneumonia and be gone in a week.
- The idea of metanoia returns again and again in my life. The purpose of life is to see what you do when challenges come your way, and the value in that experience is seeing how you handle those challenges.
- I was great at testing products at 20,000 feet, but talking them up to buyers? No, not really.
- It went way beyond just sex with Catherine. It was more like recognizing a time of shared destiny of our souls. We were both born to climb, and we each glimpsed the possibility of the perfect partner in the other.
- I think I know now that you can't do this sort of climbing and have a domestic side. You're not a practicing father if you're not there. You're maybe a visiting father.
- For me, one of the attractions simply is the variety of interests that climbing serves. In the Himalayas, it's the traveling, the different cultures you experience, the friends you make around the world. On the wall in the gym, it's the feeling of fitness, it's more exciting than pumping iron and motivates you to keep working out.
- I'm not a big adrenaline junkie.
- Being willing to risk it all for any given climb will inevitably end at some point in disaster.
- I used to think aging was a scam, a total abdication of your self. Well, aging's not a scam, but quitting is.
- I never did end up getting any skills that are marketable in a traditional sense, but I have used my knowledge of the mountains, and I have no regrets.
- Many climbers use the term 'objective hazard; to denote something they aren't to be held accountable for. I held myself accountable for the mistakes I made over the years.
- I've been mistagged. I like ice climbing, but I do a lot more rock climbing. Ice is just more mysterious and changeable than rock.
- The challenges of adventure, rock climbing and alpinism trained me well for dealing with the slow neurodegenerative malady I'm experiencing.
- Wall climbing is an offshoot of the more traditional sport of mountain climbing. It is very difficult; one must combine a great deal of stamina with the ability of a world-class gymnast.

- Mom would pack our lunch and send us off with no supervision. There were enough of us so that if she lost a few, there would still be plenty left.
- I always thought if I died in the mountains, it would put an asterisk on my climbs.
- I mean any fool can hurl themselves at a climb that is beyond their abilities to safely negotiate. You may get away with such an approach nine times, but the tenth time you don't come back.

- I hate big shots of adrenaline. It means you don't have enough margin.
- I can see the time coming when I won't need to be out there in the upper pyramid of climbing, but the things you gain from a lifetime of climbing are worth communicating.
- For me there's no future. All I'm interested in is now.
- Eight-man teams drilling expansion bolts in rocks? Sorry, that's not climbing - that's engineering.
- You have to have a lot of experience and confidence and a willingness to go down when things aren't right and try again.

It's what gets people killed.
- We as mountaineers have had a leading role in the destruction of the mountain wilderness environment that we practice our sport in.
- It's dangerous if you don't know what you're doing. The greatest risk of injury is knocking off a piece of ice with your pick and having it fall on your forehead.
- I still value the adventurous side, confronting the mountain on its terms, more than I value actual success in terms of getting to the top. That has very little meaning to me.
- I have always felt that no climb is worth losing the tip of a little toe.

- My awareness left my body and ego, and went on a grand tour of the cosmos.
- The kind of climbing I like is fast and as free as possible of gadgetry.
