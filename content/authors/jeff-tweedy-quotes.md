- I always found the concept of a tortured artist distasteful.
- Sometimes it's liberating to confront horrible things in lyrics as a way to master the shadow-self that exists in everyone.
- You obviously don't really forget how to play the old songs; you just don't have to spend so much time convincing yourself that you remember them. Way less mental energy is spent swimming around in lyrics you've already written and chords you've already played.
- Even when I don't think I'm writing, I'm writing. There's some part of my brain geared toward making songs up, and I know it's collecting things and I know when I get a moment to be by myself, that's when they come out.
- Stop trying to treat music like it's a tennis shoe, something to be branded. If the music industry wants to save money, they should take a look at some of their six-figure executive expense accounts. All those lawsuits can't be cheap, either.
- The sublime moment seems to be only a product of allowing yourself to get through, to get to a lot of stuff in your life, write about a lot of stuff and not edit yourself. That is a great lesson to learn for anybody that writes or creates in anyway, to be able to make something without being good or bad.
- Even the most dismal and hopeless-sounding Wilco music, to my ears, has always maintained a level of hope and consolation.
- I was never at my best when I was at my worst. When I did do good stuff in the past, it was because I was able to transcend the parts of my being that weren't healthy.
- I have always thought it was important to maintain some connection for myself to what it takes to make a song work by myself, to put a song across to an audience by myself.
- I've been buying instruments and musical gear for a long time.
- I didn't want to admit that I was falling into a cliche.
- I always think I don't have any songs, I don't have anything I'm working on, and I get in the studio and realize there are 20 things I'm thinking about. It's just kind of second nature.
- We'd been noticing how much more important the internet had become - once information is out there in the world now, anyone can get it. Since that was beginning to happen with the record anyway, we figured, OK, let's just stream it for free ourselves.
- We live in a connected world now. Some find that frightening. If people are downloading our music, they're listening to it. The internet is like radio for us.
- I like making songs up. Whether or not they're great songs or good songs, whatever. It's something I've always done, and I definitely feel like I've gotten better at it.
- I don't think there is anything hard at all about having a lot of songs. It makes it easier to be less precious about them, and know that everybody's going to want to work on some of them.
- Writing songs has always been hard and easy. It's not always easy when you want it to be, and then sometimes it's just like turning on the faucet. That's just the nature of it.
- I've been obsessed with seeing life through music. My records, my relationship with records, my relationship with rock stars, everything that surrounds it, has been really one of the only ways that I ever started to understand the world.
- I think somehow you need to get to a certain point in your life where the notion of failure is absurd.
- Treating your audience like thieves is absurd. Anyone who chooses to listen to our music becomes a collaborator.
- I don't believe every download is a lost sale.
- I think art is a consolation regardless of its content. It has the power to move and make you feel like you're not.
- I just try to get inside the song and imagine what comes next.
- I guess I don't think there's any reason to feel guilty about having joy in your life, regardless of how bad things are in the world.
- I don't think you can be good in life without acknowledging the part of you that isn't good.
