- I think that there are three incredible brands in the news and information space. I think ESPN owns sports; I think the Weather Channel owns weather, and I want CNN to own news and information in the global digital video space.
- When an authoritarian regime starts taking down feeds and blocking websites just because we expose the truth... that's an attack on freedom of the press everywhere. When authoritarian regimes around the world start attacking journalists like that, we all have a problem.
- The beauty of the Internet is that anybody can be a broadcaster now.
- I grew up watching CNN, and my memory of CNN is James Earl Jones saying, 'This is CNN.'
- It's a growing trend. Viewers are our customers, but so are advertisers. And advertisers want different ways to reach our viewers.
- The world has changed - we can all get news 24/7 from any device, any outlet... but we want to tell different stories in different ways, and add to the news.
- Everybody has an iPhone; everyone can be a reporter now. Everybody can tell a story from every part of the world. Why places like CNN matter is that it is still important to bring them together, put context around it, and explain it.
- I think the Internet has given rise to voices that want to attack others.
- I think the era of access journalism as we've known it is over.
- More traffic means more advertising dollars.
- Michael Jackson is the ultimate traffic accident. People can't take their eyes off him.
- I think Vice is vastly overrated. And I think that if you are interested in reaching young males, which is what I think Vice's calling card has been, CNN's digital properties reach far more young men on a weekly basis than Vice does.
- The job of media is the accountability of government.
- I don't think Vice and BuzzFeed are legitimate news organizations.
- Anderson Cooper's on-air reaction to Bob Simon's death; Wolf Blitzer personalizing his experience in going back to Auschwitz where his grandparents lost their lives - I think that has all made our air more authentic.
- If you love television and you love news, CNN is the perfect place to be.
- I watch a ton of CNN.
- People are looking for original content in many different places, as are advertisers. This takes us into a whole new ballgame.
- CNN is not and never will abandon our first and fundamental brand equity, which is news and breaking news.
- Climate change is one of those stories that deserves more attention, that we all talk about, but we haven't figured out how to engage the audience in that story in a meaningful way. When we do do those stories, there does tend to be a tremendous amount of lack of interest on the audience's part.
- In an increasingly polarized world, it's hard to know whom to trust. CNN will be the only news channel that doesn't take a side.
- Would I consider a run for political office? Yes.
- Chaos is good for CNN.
- CNBC is a very serious-minded financial news network, and what we've seen thus far from Fox appears to be not as investment-focused or financially focused, and that's good for us.
- The perception of Donald Trump in capitals around the world is shaped, in many ways, by CNN. Continuing to have an adversarial relationship with that network is a mistake.
- It's one of the things I respect about Time Warner and Turner: their understanding of CNN's independence.
- I think it's the sign of a leader to step up and say, you know, when something's not working to have the guts to reverse it. And the worst thing you can do is to let that mistake linger.
- CNN is not a television network that has a website. CNN is a full-fledged media company.
- I like Donald. I guess I shouldn't call him that. I like President Trump. He's affable. He's funny.
- When people think about CNN today, they think about our television coverage, politics, and Donald Trump. And I get it; I'm not suggesting that's wrong. But I think there is a much bigger story going on at CNN.
- I don't regret putting 'The Apprentice' on television.
- I've always thrived on challenges, both personally and professionally.
- I'd like to run a professional football team. I'd love to run the USTA, be the sports editor of the 'New York Times.'
- The cable model is just a better model. Dual revenue stream: advertising-supported and subscription-supported revenues.
- When the Paris terror attacks happen, when war breaks out in Ukraine, when unrest happens in Ferguson, people know that CNN is the place to come.
- Local television is a slightly different story. It is under much more pressure in the same way that all local businesses are, whether that's a local newspaper, local radio or local television. But I think television in the aggregate is actually in very good shape.
- Just because somebody says you are not trustworthy, that doesn't mean it is so... CNN's brand equity is built over 37 years doing hard work in very dangerous places... those who rely on CNN trust CNN more than ever.
- It is a significant acknowledgment that the way people are watching television is changing and the model is quickly changing.
- It used to be CNN and other television outlets were founded on this idea of a news wheel. You give us 22 minutes, and we'll give you the world. But that's not the way people consume news and information any more.
- I've always been interested in the news, but I've always been interested in what's popular. I've always had a little bit of a populist take on things. Which I know is interesting when you talk about Donald Trump.
- You don't need to be partisan. CNN does need to stick to a nonpartisan point of view. That doesn't mean there can't be more passion and excitement.
- I think you could argue that President Obama could have watched a little cable news... I do think that there is value in understanding where the conversation is and having a little less detachment where the popular conversation is.
- In the cable news arena, you have two partisan networks looking out for their viewers. I think CNN needs to look out for the rest of us.
- I have had a unique relationship with Donald Trump. I'm also the one who put him and 'The Apprentice' on the air at NBC. I've known who he is and what he is for a long time.
- If I was on Twitter, I'd probably get in trouble pretty quickly.
- Do not be intimidated. Go where the story goes. Report the facts. Make sure you've got it right. And don't let things that the president says or that the White House does throw you off your game.
- The critics of Donald Trump are looking for people to blame for his rise. There are many people who are either surprised by his strength or don't like him and want to blame someone to explain why he has been this popular.
- The television business is actually going through a tremendous transition, but I think at the end of the day, television is still paramount.
- I've said this forever - I've always believed the Today show is more than the sum of its parts.
- I've spent over half my life at NBC. This is the only place I have ever worked.
- We're in this transition period of figuring out how to deal with all the new technology that is out there, but television still proves to be the granddaddy of them all.
