- There is no way American sports are any cleaner than cycling.
- Sports has always been a great entry point for us to discuss issues that are pretty widely known in society.

- Not to oversimplify what football coaches do, but their success or failure hinges on concepts that aren't foreign to any coach.
- When NASCAR drivers blast one another with their cars out of anger it isn't symptomatic of what's wrong with white people. So please don't turn a silly NBA fight into a town hall meeting about what's wrong with African Americans - even though, unfortunately, something like this somehow winds up reflecting poorly on the entire black community.
- Even for a billionaire, a divorce isn't easy.
- I am the columnist who plays the would-this-happen-to-a-white-guy game because there are just too many double standards. But I'm equal opportunity with the game, including Hispanics, Asians, women and men.

- If you've ever seen photos of LeBron James away from the basketball court, it's obvious he takes great pride in his appearance.
- SportsCenter' is the legacy brand at ESPN, I had a great year doing the show. But it was not a fit for me because ultimately I had a lot of things that I really wanted to say and wanted to express, and the 'SportsCenter' vehicle is not necessarily set up for that.
- I think one of the innate challenges that comes with being on ESPN is that it is a sports network. It is an entertainment space largely, and because of that - as should be the case - politics aren't expected to be addressed in a meaningful way at a sports network.

- Whenever black folks speak candidly about the horrors of police brutality, the default reaction in the United States isn't to start disrupting and dismantling the system of prejudices that enables the abuse of black people, but to demand silence and, sometimes, outright obedience.
- Contrary to stodgy opinions, young men have a right to go out. They want to hang with their peers. They want to talk to women. They want to show off a little of their success. Nothing wrong with any of that - as long as they're careful.
- The Lakers got Pau Gasol for 10 rubles and a John Tesh DVD.
- One of the worst things in sports is when selfishness gets disguised as truth.
- Although study after study shows black men are more likely to be victims of crime, rarely do they receive victim treatment. When black athletes are crime victims, the undertone seems to be they somehow were at fault.
- I used to think my dad and I talked sports because it was just an easy way for two people who didn't know each other that well to make conversation. I see now it's also a way for me to see who my dad really is and, if I'm lucky, see why he made the choices he did.

- When a country doesn't respect Black lives, maybe it doesn't deserve to be entertained by Black athletes.
- Just because I'm a black woman doesn't mean I've got an automatic sensitivity chip for cultures outside of my own.

- The overwhelming majority of NFL owners are white, and when they do choose to get involved in politics, they usually champion conservative causes.
- As a kid, I heard elders in my family say in passing that Jewish people were consumed with making money, and that they 'owned everything.' My relatives never dwelled on the subject, and nothing about their tone indicated that they thought anything they were saying was anti-Semitic - not that a lack of awareness would be any excuse.
- Racism has never been outright gone in the history of this nation, but I think we've had moments where everybody has been really fed up with its presence.

- America hasn't been able to grapple with the uncomfortable reality that police brutality is encoded in this country's DNA.
- Think about the most successful coaches in sports. What did they all have in common? It wasn't their knowledge of X's and O's. It was their ability to lead, motivate and manage - traits you need no matter what or where you coach.

- Every day, we read about athletes who let their sport define them.

- Anyone who generates opinion for a living is going to get plenty of feedback, positive or negative. Some people indeed don't like the fact that I'm a woman with strong opinions. And if they disagree with me, they are quick to point out what my gender is. I chalk it up to being the nature of people.
- Perspective should never influence punishment. Too often in our society, we practice selective perspective. We're willing to see all the angles only when it suits us. When perspective becomes inconvenient, we can be unflinching, even cruel.

- Detroit is known as 'Hockeytown,' but the Lions are truly the soul of the city.
- This country's response to the coronavirus has been disastrous because of poor, incompetent leadership at the national and state levels. More than 4.6 million Americans have become infected with the coronavirus. Basic safety precautions have been manipulated into a political issue.
- Even though I'm from Detroit, my favorite NFL team is the 49ers. My mother went to junior college in the Bay area and Joe Montana was her favorite athlete. So somehow I became a 49ers fan.
- I'm usually fine with NFL players holding out. Considering the risk of injury and no guaranteed contracts, you can't blame them for getting what they can when they have the most leverage.
- The sports world provides a great platform for racial discussions. It's also one of the few places in society where, 99 percent of the time, performance trumps race. Most times, but not always.

- Newsflash: competitive athletes fight sometimes. They also are egomaniacs.
- If you're paying taxes in this country, you have a right to voice your criticisms of your own government. That's pretty much the foundation of American freedom.
- I've found in conversations with people - and not just white people either, because I realize there are some Black people that voted for Trump - usually when I get in these conversations with people who voted for Trump, there was always some level of his bigotry that appealed to them. Banning Muslims, building a wall, it was always something.
- If the lead line in my obituary is 'She once tweeted that the president is a white supremacist,' I will see my life as a professional disappointment.

- Yes, I discuss race openly, honestly and, hopefully, intelligently.
- Can I just say that PBR is one of the most underrated beers of all time? And good God it's cheap.
- I firmly believe you don't get better until you've been at your worst.
- Race impacts 90 percent of our society - and I'm probably undershooting that figure. I find this fascinating and like to address it when pertinent.

- For some reason, when Colin Kaepernick took a knee, people remained undecided about the side of history that he was on - which was clearly short-sighted on their part, because he was always right. Because there was no public momentum or approval behind what he did, people found it easier to say things like 'stick to sports.'
