- WikiLeaks exposed corruption, war crimes, torture and cover-ups. It showed that we were lied to about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan; that the U.S. military had deliberately hidden information about systematic torture and civilian casualties, which were much higher than reported.
- Accountability and democratic choice, I deeply believe, are guaranteed by rigorous scrutiny only.
- There's a theory about fame: the moment it strikes, it arrests development. Michael Jackson remained suspended in childhood, enjoying sleepovers and funfairs; Winona Ryder, an errant teen who dabbled in shoplifting and experimented with pills; George Clooney, a 30-year-old commitment-phobe, never quite ready yet to settle down.
- Fame infantilises and grants relative impunity. Those that seek it, out of an exaggerated need for admiration or attention, are often the least well equipped to deal with criticism.
- In my experience, being busy and working hard is the key to sanity/happiness.
- WikiLeaks exposed the most dangerous lies of all, which are those that are told to us by elected governments.
- I couldn't define my style; that's impossible. I like comfort and elegance with a bit of glamour thrown in. If I like something, I'll wear it for years.
- Marriage Asian-style is practical, contractual and, to the western mind, deeply unromantic.
- Arranged marriages are big business in the U.K. Second- and third-generation immigrant families, with no extended family structure, limited networks and religious restrictions on acceptable ways to meet future spouses, are turning to external matchmakers for help.
