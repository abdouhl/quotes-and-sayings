- One of the things I always tell people when they're going to get married is, in order to have a lasting relationship, there are a couple of things you need to discuss. One is finance, obviously. Then there's religion, politics, kids, how you discipline kids, and how many kids you want to have.
- But we're open to adopting any children that come to our door.

- Fostering is the most worthwhile and selfless act of love you can ever imagine. The children will teach you so much about your own life.
- I'm as much of a fan of Hallmark Channel as I am an actress for the network.
