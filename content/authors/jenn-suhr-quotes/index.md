- I've made some mistakes before.
- There's so much more important parts other than pole vaulting.
- Pole vaulting is an event of high and lows.
- I'm becoming more powerful.
- When you're jumping, it's just an aggressiveness, but I think the exhilaration and the fun comes after you make the bar and you're falling. That's the best part - a few seconds to celebrate and relax.
