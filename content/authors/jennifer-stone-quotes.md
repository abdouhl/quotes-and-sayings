- During the summertime, I really like to dress like a gypsy. I love that whole lifestyle and the whole mixing of fabrics and flowy materials.
- I love any kind of acting, so if I could focus on becoming the best actor I can strictly on my voice, I would love that.
- I look at some of the old villains in the Disney movies. If you really listen, you can hear some of the villains or some of the supporting characters, they use the voices over and over because they were so versatile in the way that they performed on voiceovers.
- I buy Coppertone Water Babies in abundance at the airport, SPF 60 or 70. I like being pale; I like looking like a creature from the dead world. I like looking like a ghost.
- I do have an older brother! But you know, he and I have always gotten along. We've always had different aspirations.
- This is going to sound cheesy, but with acting there are so many tools. When you're on camera, you're using all of it. You're using the voice, you're using your body, you're using wardrobe, all of it, but it's funny, once you take all of those things away, you realize how much you rely on the physicality.
