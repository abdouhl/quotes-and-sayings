- Moderation is never something I've been good at.

- I know the new comedy god is surrealism, but it doesn't touch my heart.
- I've got this horrible feeling that I'm one of those people who'll always have to flog their guts out to get anywhere.

- My daughter has always had a strong sense of her own identity. From the day she was born her father and I were in love with and in awe of her and still are.

- For me, being a woman suits what I want to talk about and what my audience wants to hear. Maybe I'm a dying breed.
- I have a fear of poverty in old age. I have this vision of myself living in a skip and eating cat food. It's because I'm freelance, and I've never had a proper job. I don't have a pension, and my savings are dwindling. I always thought someone would just come along and look after me.
- I've got a hat face. My mother always said I've got a hat face.
- People often ask why comedy is harder for women, and the reason is because a tampon will sometimes fall out when you're on stage. Blokes don't have that worry.

- I think my siblings sometimes have to defend me within their social circles - they are both barristers.

- There should be more booing in shops and restaurants and places like that when when the service is bad. If you've had a poor breakfast in a hotel, you should put your knife and fork down and boo.
