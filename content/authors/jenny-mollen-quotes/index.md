- On Twitter, people just want to hear a joke. They don't really want to know about your life.
- My parents have been married multiple times each, so the idea of being committed to somebody was scary.
- My brother and I have never been that close. We have different mothers and never lived in the same house. As kids, my sister, Samantha, and I lived in San Diego and Brad in Brooklyn. The only time I saw him was in the summer when our visitations with our father overlapped.
- Discipline tops my list of most-hated things, followed closely by portobello mushrooms.
- I never had a go-to girl squad. I think that I'm only friends with loners, so I have a select group of loners that I hang out with individually.
- Very few things are off-limits for me.
- I don't think that crazy should have a negative connotation - it just means that you're fun. I think that crazy is just a term that boring people use to describe fun people.
- Marriage is amazing.
- My greatest fear for my child is that he marries a woman exactly like me.
- I was never the girl who yearned for children. I pretended to be interested in other people's kids, but that was obviously just an act.
- I think the power of persuasion would be the greatest superpower of all time.
- It was hard to write about my dad for the first book because I know how sensitive he is. I knew he wasn't going to take it as well as my mom, who can kind of roll with the punches and is used to having me tell her everything she has done wrong as a parent.
- I surround myself with bizarre people. They're more fun to write about.
- I don't think enough women are being honest about motherhood.
- I don't know how not to share.
- Long story short: E. L. James is a hero.
- I don't want to read about the fabricated version of someone's life. I want to know what haunts you, what are you ashamed of, what embarrasses you, what do you wish was different?
- Chelsea Handler is a good friend of mine, and I always was inspired by the fact that she was taking her life and turning it into these ridiculous, raunchy memoirs. She really has a talent, and she's a great writer. I was inspired by her trajectory.
- From your first kid, your body still kind of looks the same once you get back in shape.
- There's this unspoken assumption when you're the child of a doctor that nothing is ever wrong with you - or at least nothing horrendous enough to warrant your father leaving work.
- At 41 and a half weeks pregnant, I started to have second thoughts about becoming a mother.
- Social media has changed my life, and it taught me that you can make your own path and really find who you are as an artist, in whatever capacity.
- I read 'The First Bad Man' by Miranda July, and I just thought, 'Oh my God, I'll never be this good. That book is so incredible.'
- I think, as a woman and as somebody in the entertainment industry, we have to be careful what we're putting out there and what we're trying to say.
- In a healthy relationship, there is stability and security.
- Just to be able to make money doing what you love - you can't ask for anything more.
- I just hope that people, women specifically, embrace that side of themselves that maybe is a little nuts or that society tells us is crazy.
- I rarely tweet unless I'm talking about 'The Bachelor.' I have a love/hate relationship with Instagram, though - it's like a rigid parent. It's much more restrictive with what can be posted, but you can write a full paragraph, post a video - it changes the game a little bit.
- I wouldn't be a writer if I couldn't tell the truth.
- I've always gravitated toward men who sort of kind of eclipsed me in some way. And I think that it's because I have this need to be better.
- I don't mind the term 'feminist.'
- The books on my nightstand are so bizarre, very eclectic - like, every German author, and then I have a couple of books by this ex-boyfriend of mine there. I just want to make sure that he's not too much better than I am!
- I want to be doing something that I love and actually being able to feed myself by doing it.
- I just want everyone to like me. That's my main flaw.
