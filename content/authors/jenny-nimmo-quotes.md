- Every book that you pick up takes you a step away from your real world, but if you read a book about magic, it takes you an extra two steps.
- I had written two or three books before my husband noticed that in every one of them a family member was missing. He suggested that it was because my father's death, when I was five, utterly changed my world. I can only suppose he is right and that this is the reason I am drawn to a narrative where someone's life is changed by loss.
- I work in a room overlooking the river. I try to get to my desk as soon as I've fed my cats and chickens. I use a blue 3B pencil and scribble away for about 20 pages before transferring it to the computer.
- Inspiration comes from the world around me. I'm an inveterate eavesdropper.
- There's nothing like the peace of the countryside, the quiet and the lack of distraction. It helps you to focus your mind.
- I try not to identify too strongly with any of my characters. I like to stand back and see them objectively. I think this is why I often use boys instead of girls, just in case I get too close and lose the overall picture.
- My father died when I was quite small, so my uncle used to buy me books and read them to me.
- I've read up on magic, and I think it sets you free, and it gives you hope. You can explore worlds you didn't know existed. It stretches your imagination, and I like my own imagination to be stretched and also the children I'm telling the story to. It gives you a sense of wonder.
