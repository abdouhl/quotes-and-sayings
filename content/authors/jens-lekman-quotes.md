- My aim is for every song to have a purpose - for you to be able to say, 'This song is about this.' But love and heartbreak are some of the most abstract subjects.
- I think sometimes when I sit down to write a song, it doesn't come out naturally, but when you are writing an email to someone, especially if you are writing to a stranger, you write much more spontaneously, and it's freer.
- You carry all these hurts and breakups with you forever. But there is this sort of joyful realization that the things that caused you pain were real. There is something beautiful and invigorating in holding onto that.
- Older men in my family - back to my grandpa - were basically completely bald.
- I was in my early 30s, and I longed for real friendships and real relationships, and I started asking myself why I didn't have that. I had a couple of male friends, but every time I would hang out with them, it felt like there was something keeping us apart.
- I think it's healthy that people that work in a creative field look for inspiration in a different creative field.
- I think when you get into your 30s, you start to realize all of the patterns you have in your life and all of the stuff that you're avoiding. It's a terribly unsung period in people's lives. I can't think about many artists who have sung about it, because it's so not sexy.
- I don't want music to be a museum.
- I realize that 'Postcards' was like input, and 'Ghostwriting' was output. I had all these frustrations and feelings before I did those two projects. 'Postcards' was something that brought new life and creative inspiration into the record, while 'Ghostwriting' was relieving myself.
- I wanted to write songs about other people because I was sick of myself, basically. I didn't like myself very much. 'Ghostwriting' became an outlet for that. And then I could get back to get Jens Lekman again.
- When I was working on 'Night Falls Over Kortedala,' I was listening a lot to 'Graceland,' the Paul Simon record. I really got into the lyrics on that album. The opening line is so brilliant, the way he sets the scene.
- Getting my hair cut is just a very special moment for me. I don't know exactly why, but it's such an intimate, almost religious experience. I'm very careful with who gets to cut my hair.
- My old songs used to take place in Gothenburg; then, when I lived in Melbourne, the songs just naturally took place more in Melbourne.
- I try and take it for what it is, and I'm very at peace with the fact that when I'm done with the songs, they don't belong to me anymore. They belong to the listeners.
- It's good to let go of control. That's probably something all artists and song writers will say at some point.
- I found a favorite chord, which is B flat 7 - that's my favorite chord.
- You always try different versions of yourself through songwriting. It can get a bit annoying to see them walk around and do their thing when you feel like, 'I'm not that person any more.'
- I wouldn't write about something that I haven't experienced myself.
- Once I release a song, it's not just about me or the people... I write about. They're my stories, but they're not really mine any more.
- It always feel like people are doing more grown-up things than you are.
- What I can't fit into my suitcase is probably something I don't need.
- I started running to different albums, and I was starting with the short albums and moving on to the longer albums. I was interested in how they built up, in tempo and intensity. it made me interested in albums again, too.
- I have a very nice voice.
- It was never part of how I imagined my music, and I watched in awe at how this ukulele troubadour image suddenly devoured the Jens Lekman I had planned so carefully.
- Some very silly songs can have an almost melancholy feeling when you put it in a different perspective.
- For me, it's sort of like a cultural democracy or musical socialism to take a stand and get out of the major cities if you can.
- This is one of the reasons I'm so interested in stories. Because everyone has a story in their life, and when their story doesn't make sense, that's when we get depressed, I think.
- Every wedding is slightly different from the other. But you always get to meet the funny uncle and the weirdo relatives, and there's always someone trying to beat you up for not playing enough Beatles songs or something.
- I feel like the few times in my life when I really felt like I love my own story is when I've been the happiest.
- The way to write really good songs is to write about the things that happen in your life and where you are in the moment, and writing about stuff that happens in your 30s is not the sexiest song subject.
- Summer is always best through a window.
- I think there are definitely a lot of subjects I don't share with people, but I'm not sure where that border is.
- I think a lot of my songs are very silly and very stupid, written to entertain people, but in the end, I always come to that last line, and I feel that I have to wrap this up with a bit of dignity and a little tear in the eye; otherwise, the joke would be on the characters in the song.
- I grew up in the '90s and remember the lyrics back then were so abstract and open to interpretation. That always drove me crazy.
- I really do believe in clearing samples, and I believe that people should be compensated for them, but the laws are just so stupid.
- I would love to hear Marilyn Manson's fans or something, what their stories would be like.
- I became paranoid for a long time: I thought that people were out to harm me.
- A lot of my songs are written prophetically: I write something, and then I make it happen.
- Hmm... at some point when I was making 'Postcards,' it struck me, what the underlying themes for the record would be. It would be about choices, fears and doubts, and it had an existentialist theme to it.
- I feel like it's my responsibility not to leave the listener in a pool of dread.
- The whole thing with playing on a stage with mics and all that has always been kind of uncomfortable to me.
- I'm very very happy for my hardships and misfortunes: they build character and make you a better person. Even if I think it's something you have to carry with you, it's definitely something that makes you more empathic towards other people, makes you understand people and relationships so much better.
- I need to write a sitcom, but something with warmth, not one where the dad comes home and he's treated like an idiot.
- I've started listening to music in a new way after I started running. When it comes to running, I really got into the idea of track listings that way, too.
- Sometimes you have to burn yourself to the ground before you can rise like a phoenix from the ashes.
- My first single was based around the mishearing of the words 'make believe' - 'I thought she said maple leaves.' That kind of stuff is very central to my music and my life.
- In the past, I used to rely on the randomness of working with samples, which was a good way because it threw you in a completely different direction. You just thought, 'What if I take this samba drum and combined it with an '80s synth line or something from this record?'
- I don't like irony and sarcasm very much. But I do like it when you think someone is telling you a joke, and then you discover it's serious.
- Ever since I started writing music, I've wanted to know what the songs are about and to be able to tell stories.
- When I was a kid, I had a period in my life when I was eight or nine when I was so scared of dying that I wouldn't go out of our house for a whole year. I refused to step out of the door because I thought something would happen. I had all these compulsive thoughts or whatever, and my head was really messed up.
- I've never felt at home in Kortedala, or in Gothenburg, so I always felt like I needed to go somewhere and find some kind of perspective on things.
- I start writing songs first as an entertainer, and I like funny stories that wrap up with dignity.
- When you're writing about difficult things and darker issues, it's nice to offer some sort of light at the end of the tunnel. Some sense of hope. Sometimes, the best way to do that is by offering it in the music, so that you can dance your way out of the darkness.
- The 'sent' folder of my email program is really my biggest inspiration and my biggest source of lyrics. That's where I go to pick up a lot of the lyrics that I'm writing.
- There's so much nostalgia for music from the past.
- I have mood swings, but I'm sure people in England have that, too. Me and my friends, we're just a bunch of happy idiots.
- If there's two things I will never do, it would be grow a beard and pick up the uke again.
- I remember when I grew up and Dad would take me to kindergarten in the morning, and you could smell the chips in the air from the factory nearby.
- I went to Legoland in Denmark when I was five, I think, but I went to Germany when I was 17 to have a little adventure after graduation.
- It's not difficult getting into the charts in Sweden. It's a very different musical climate, and in a very good way, I think, because artists like Jose Gonzalez or The Knife can actually get on the charts.
- I think all the best songs do that: they offer some sort of hope and light in the darkness.
- Making albums is a very lonely process sometimes. Sitting around working on songs, feeling the pressure.
- If you come to the conclusion that there is no conclusion, well, that's a conclusion, too.
- Even if I wrote a song about math or animals or whatever, there would still be the question, 'Why did you write about that? And what does it say about you?'
- I think, in a world of mouths, I want to be an ear.
- Contemporary Swedish artists that chose Swedish as their language tended to sing about certain topics and use words I wanted to avoid.
- When it comes to heartbreaks and disappointments, I often have to be more or less done with them to be able to write about them. Then you might ask why I would write about them at all, but I think I owe it to the Jens of the past.
- I think a lot of my anxieties and fears are things that are very abstract.
- I like telling stories with a sense of humor. But humor can also distance you from the subject you're writing about. I'm interested in using humor as a portal to something a bit more serious.
- I struggled with a lot of doubts around my songwriting and around what I was and what my purpose and mission were.
- Really, to me, a really good evening would be a comedian, followed by a band, followed by a really good DJ.
- I actually have all these tapes, from when I was five, from when I was 10, and from when I was 15, that don't really have to do anything with each other, but they're sort of archeological in my musical history.
- I like short beards. Not a big fan of the bigger beards.
- I really love the idea of stepping into another character and being able to sing maybe stuff that is not my thought and my own opinions, but be able to portray someone else and take a walk in their shoes for a while.
- It's weird talking about the album as a living being with its own thoughts and direction, especially if you're the one creating it.
- I think of the Jens Lekman in the songs as a completely different person who's stealing my stories.
- Australia's beautiful, but I'm not too into Australian culture.
- I had a drummer in my band who started teaching me tricks to come up with interesting rhythms. Because I don't come from a musical background, I've never studied music, and I don't know music theory at all, so a lot of stuff I discover on my own are things students would learn in the first grade of music.
- Goteborg used to be a not very cool place to live. The culture centered around shrimp and bingo. Bands played Copenhagen and Stockholm and skipped Goteborg.
- I'm not too fond of the typical Australian activities or culture. I'm not into surfing - that's what I'm trying to say.
- The idea of printing out something that's as scary as a tumor into its concrete form was something that spoke to me - there is something very liberating about that idea.
- I still love touring rock clubs around the world, and that's something that's really a part of me. I love making albums, and I'm a wedding singer on the side; that's my parallel career. So I love all those aspects of making music.
- Christmas music is usually more concentrated pop music in a way. It's meant to make us feel good, and it's meant to make us like we belong somewhere.
- I realized that even though I had this urge, this longing, to write about other people, in order for it to be emotionally gripping, I needed to be in there somehow.
- I've always been interested in listening to people's stories.
- I think that's a responsibility I have, to not leave the listener with complete dread or depressing, dark thoughts, but to leave a little door open so that you can dance your way out if you want to.
- Nirvana was a band that led you somewhere, as opposed to all the grunge bands that began and ended with themselves.
- Of the times that I've been able to overcome a fear, it's been by making it something that I can understand, that I can hold on to - just something that's more tangible.
- I love playing small towns, but in Sweden, it's sometimes a little bit weird, because all small towns are just so close to bigger cities that people are not as grateful when you show up as they are in Odessa, Texas.
- I find it quite hard to connect with the songs where I portray myself as this clumsy, adorable, love-struck man-child.
- I think South Korea was one of the best shows I've ever done in my whole life. The people there were crazy. It was literally Beatlemania.
- One of the nice things about songwriting is you can be inspired by absolutely anything.
- Any band that doesn't have a sense of humor has a little bit of a problem.
- My songs don't deal with locations that specifically, even if there are very specific references to them in there; they're sort of just where stories happen, not the stories themselves.
- 'Postcards' was just a way of slapping myself in the face and saying, 'You can do anything! Just go for it!'
- I have this part in myself that sometimes gets me into situations that can never end well, just because I want to prove to myself that I'm no good.
- I realised that music controls me more than I control music. I had to write songs that were convincing me that things would get better.
- I think it's because Toronto is the Gothenburg of Canada, with the trends and the music and everything. I feel very at home when I'm there. Everyone has always been so kind to me.
- I've established a certain voice over my albums. It can be an obstacle, but in the end, I think it's a strength, because I can build upon that voice, which is ultimately very much mine.
- A lot of people would write to me long stories from their lives, and I felt they were thinking of me as some sort of treasure chest to keep their secrets. I felt like sometimes they would tell me stories they wouldn't tell anybody else in the whole world. And I loved these stories.
