- We have a good sense of the pulse of the industry. We know what's going on out there. We know that deep learning adoption is broad. It's going into production at scale.
- People are going to use more and more AI. Acceleration is going to be the path forward for computing. These fundamental trends, I completely believe in them.
- The automation of automation, the automation of intelligence, is such an incredible idea that if we could continue to improve this capability, the applications are really quite boundless.
- People play games seriously. People host tournaments. People watch other people play and listen to broadcasters talking about it. The kind of entire ecosystem we see around other sports and forms of entertainment has formed around games as well.
- We're very careful to select what domains we'll build to serve. I completely believe in domain-specific architectures.
- Manufacturing all over the world has the benefit of efficiency. That's great. I support it.
- When you increase productivity, economies become better - local economies become better, society becomes better.
- The amount of computation necessary for raytracing, we've known for a long time, is many orders of magnitude more intensive than rasterization.
- Every market we go to, we have a domain-specific language. Every domain-specific language, underneath, has an architecture.
- Without intellectual honesty, you can't have a culture that's willing to tolerate failure because people cling too much to an idea that likely will be bad or isn't working and they feel like their reputation is tied up in it. They can't admit failure.
- I'm looking forward to real big advances in autopilot capability. I'm also expecting companies all over the world starting to deploy mapping and experimental cars for taxi services. You'll see a lot more activity around that.
- There are very few industries that I know of - I mean, there are companies in fashion, in cosmetics. They're developing AI models and training them in the cloud in the beginning. If they're successful, they build their own datacenters and develop the software in their own datacenter, like Uber does.
- The single most important thing for any processor is getting adoption by software developers.
- Gaming notebooks aren't that abundant. Not that many gamers are able to play on notebooks.
- Some people say the network is the computer. We believe the display is the computer. Anywhere there's a pixel, that's where we want to be.
- I don't think you can create culture and develop core values during great times. I think it's when the company faces adversity of extraordinary proportions, when there's no reason for the company to survive, when you're looking at incredible odds - that's when culture is developed, character is developed.
- Business comes and goes and we make a strategic decision that could lead you to whole new place.
- Performance matters because games are built on great performance, but form factor and energy efficiency matter incredibly because they want to build something that's portable and transformable.
- Smart people focus on the right things.
- A.I. will make it possible for the Internet to directly engage people in the real world, through robotics and drones and little machines that will do smart things by themselves.
- Well, I don't have any greater insight than anybody else.
- Obviously the thing that's cool about games - a basketball game is just a basketball game. The thing about video games is that each different video game can be in a completely different genre.
- The AI technology will keep you out of harm's way. That is why we believe in an AI car that drives for you.
- One of the things I'm excited about is the observation that gamers are creators and creators are gamers too. We used to think of creators as workstation customers and think of gamers as consumers.
- It's very clear that AI is going to impact every industry. I think that every nation needs to make sure that AI is a part of their national strategy. Every country will be impacted.
- A smart car is not just about giving you information, but it is also about keeping you safe.
- AI as a technology is complex, of course, but the capabilities and benefits of AI aren't hard to understand.
- I think culture is a big word for corporate character.
- We have an amazing engineering team in the company pushing the limits of device physics and some great partners in manufacturing.
- We really believe that long-term, the way AI will drive is similar to the way humans drive - we don't break the problem down into objects and vision and localization and planning. But how long it will take us to get there is questionable.
- Software is eating the world, but AI is going to eat software.
- I will say that Surface has been a big disappointment for us and for Microsoft. Both of our expectations from the product were much greater than what came to be and not only that. We invested enormous amount into research and development and spent a lot of time and energy into it.
- The Xbox is how the computer will be built in the next 20 years. More semiconductor capacity will go to the user experience.
- Our core market has been historically gamers and digital content creators such as car designers and movie makers.
- Virtual reality, all the A.I. work we do, all the robotics work we do - we're as close to realizing science fiction as it gets.
- Well, the world of entertainment and leisure is gigantic. When you combine it with all of the aspects of entertainment and leisure, going to movies or traveling or going to restaurants, staying in a hotel, skiing, it's huge.
- I happen to believe that video games will be the largest sport and entertainment in the world. The reason for that is a video game can be every sport. You can be anybody.
- Digital currency is not going away. It's here to stay.
- It turns out that a lot of gamers love design, love to create in digital.
- I love that the work that we do is so vital to science. We're in a lot of ways at the scientific front line. The work that we're doing to build up the computational defense system for infectious diseases, whether it's finding the vaccine as fast as possible this time or next time to detect early outbreaks.
- I enjoy looking at other people's products and learning from them. We take all of our competitors very seriously, as you know. You have to respect Intel. But we have our own tricks up our sleeves.
- Can we all please - I don't want anybody buying cryptocurrencies, okay? Stop it. Enough already. Or buy Bitcoin, don't buy Ethereum.
- But I think we're going to have people who work from home a couple of days a week, three days a week, four days a week. And I'm perfectly comfortable with all that.
- We're going to design future cars the way people design airplanes. Except we have to use so much technology and ingenuity to reduce its cost and its form factor. We can't afford to have a jet plane. That would be great if could.
- Software is the language of automation.
- I think that's what's thrilling about leadership - when you're holding onto literally the worst possible hand on the planet and you know you're still going to win. How are you still going to win? Because that's when the character of the company really comes out.

- Safety is not just about trying really hard and being really careful. You have to design technology that makes it possible for a computer to be safe.
- I believe that the future is about having a whole bunch of A.I., not one A.I. We're all going to have our own personal A.I. We'll have A.I. for many fields of medicine, for many fields of manufacturing.
