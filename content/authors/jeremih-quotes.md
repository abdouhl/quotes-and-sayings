- I got archives of records. I have records from when I was 17 that I still think are pretty dope.
- What I can offer the game is creating a sound that, when you hear it, you know it's mine.
- I got my first set of drums when I was around 3. I went from band to marching band to Latin jazz band - it's like riding a bike.
- Effortlessly, I feel like my records have longevity.
- I still listen to Ginuwine, man. I can still listen to Donell Jones.
- 'Down on Me' can't showcase my true talent. 'Birthday Sex' was robotic. When I perform it, I can't give you this church feeling I know I can give.
- That's my ultimate goal: to get people to say my name right.
- I was raised on the Southside of Chicago, and my whole family was musically-inclined.
- Def Jam, they've shown nothing but love as far as supporting my records. We haven't missed yet, radio-wise, and every song that they've actually tried to support has been No. 1.
- I want to show people all of me, because that's what I haven't been doing. To be able to play so many instruments, and no one's ever seen me play, it seems like someone who's bluffing.
- I'm confident as hell when I step in front of the mic.
- Everyone always wants to say I'm shy. I don't think so, but there's a disconnect with my fans. I want my fans to see me - that's what they never do.
- R. Kelly is one of the pioneers that I grew up listening to. If he's classified as an R&B artist, then I want to be like that. I don't want to have limits either.
- Nothing against Nicki Minaj - I think she's a dope lyricist, and her body is perfect, along with a dope personality. But I'm more into a woman who's not so much into the spotlight.
- It messes me up sometimes when I go on stage and people say my name wrong. Say my name wrong with all these different syllables. I've heard everything. My name is easy as 1-2-3. Jer-eh-mih, syllable-wise.
- I can't wait 'til the world embraces Chicago - not only for our talent, but just to visit our city and not be so scared to come to it and not be subjected to what people's perception is of it.
- I'm an owl; I'm up. I probably go to sleep during the time when most people wake up. The first half of the day, you might not catch me.
- I wouldn't put out anything that I didn't want to ride to.
- I'm from Chicago, so you know we come from juking and footwork.
- I'm a firm believer in time. I know a lot of people don't believe in time like I do, but I think time heals and kind of reveals all for me.
- I'm curious to know how many newborn babies will be named Jeremih after my second album.
- I've never had vocal training. No one could ever say that they helped me carve what my voice has become. It's just been more of self-training: me just continuously going into the studio every night and trying out different beats.
- I can sing, don't get me wrong, but it's no belting singing.
- If it was up to me, every show would start at midnight, and I'd give people the best of me.
- When I first got signed, I used to literally pick up a pen and pad. Write bars in my notes, even whole songs. Nowadays, I just go off the feeling.
- As far as romancing and catering to the women, I'm definitely here for all that.
- Often, it's the little things, like the title of a song, that can make a huge difference in its success.
- A lot of people are scared to come visit my hometown, but to me, violence is everywhere, man.
- I work well under pressure. Actually, I love pressure.
- If it came down to it, I wish people heard different records from me that I know give you a soul R&B sound of music that I know is really my gift, gift. But the ones that usually go are the records that radio, the fans and the clubs really love the most.
- I'm a percussionist, so that's most of what I know when I attack a record. Melodically, knowing the keys - my first love - that makes the perfect blend.
- I took about four or five years of French in high school, but I definitely don't speak French as well as I thought I did then.
- It took me five years to realize what I could do with my voice. No Auto-Tune - cut all that off.
- There are artists that actually don't like going into the studio. They get mad when people say they've got a session. I'm just the opposite. I actually enjoy it.
- Would I have signed to Def Jam if I knew they was deaf? Nah.
- I feel like music is just a platform and foundation just to be able to explore and see what's outside of it.
- Chicago, we always had it. People just shied away because it's nothing businesswise from the industry. Everybody from Chi will go to N.Y.C. or L.A. - R. Kelly to Kanye to even Twista. Everybody is great from there, but it's nothing downtown.
- My competition keeps me driven. My family and son and being home in Chicago keeps me humble, and my fans. They're the reason why I'm going hard and making sure everyone knows how to say my name.
- I grew up in a household in which they'd always play old skool classic R&B love songs - Al Green, Sam Cooke, Marvin Gaye... And my mom has even said that, when I was in her womb, she'd put the headphones to her stomach and play those songs to me!
- When I look for a woman, I look for one that's real - that's keeping it 100. I rather someone know that they're sexy and not show it.
- People send me records, and if don't like them, I won't do them; I don't care how much money you offer.
