- I always wonder whether I'll get treated differently with a different accent.
- The only mistake guys can make is to try too hard with their appearance. There's something very unmanly about it.
- I had a great drama teacher, and he sort of made out drama school as this incredibly difficult thing to get into: 6,000 people apply every year, and some of the schools only have 12 places. It's a phenomenally difficult thing to get into. And that excited me - I wanted that challenge.

- 'Great Expectations' is one of the greatest stories.
- I spend a lot of time in L.A., and I think it would probably be easier if I lived there work wise, but there's no city like London, there is so much going on. I can jump on the Tube and be anywhere in 20 minutes, and all my friends and family are here and I'm not prepared to give that up.

- I like doing stuff with my friends.
- When I find a look that I like, that's my entire wardrobe.
- I think that among my friends I'm known as being a hard worker; I think if you want to be an actor, there can't be any compromise. You have to work all day, every day. It's not a 9-5 job. There's always something to learn.

- I wouldn't want to see any animal in pain, no matter what.
- There's nothing nicer than coming back to your village, where people like my mum's friends take the mick out of me. I prefer that to the craziness of Hollywood.
- I went to an all-boys school and hated feeling like one of the crowd.
- I'm not really an animal person.
- My bedroom's like an armoury.
- I actually collect old First and Second World War memorabilia.
- I think most actors will tell you the same thing; when you're not working you put 100 percent into every audition.
