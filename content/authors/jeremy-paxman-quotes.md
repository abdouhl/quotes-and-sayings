- It seems to me that the way to remove people's cynicism is, when asked a straight question, to give a straight answer.

- I've always felt myself to be an outsider. I've always felt awkward.
- I find it odd that people take me seriously.
- I've spent my whole life being told I have a face like a horse. You are just what you are, aren't you?

- The idea of a tax on the ownership of a television belongs in the 1950s. Why not tax people for owning a washing machine to fund the manufacture of Persil?
- Watching TV is the most popular leisure activity in Britain. I find that very depressing.
- It's not just politicians. Any spokesman for a vested interest is well schooled in how to say what it is they wish to say, which may bear no relation at all to what you've asked them.
