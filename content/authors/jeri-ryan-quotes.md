- My husband is someone who's in the real world. It's a big help that I don't have both feet in Hollywood.

- I loved working with Eric Close and J T Walsh.
- I'm not so widely known that I'm going to be pigeonholed.
- The whole sex symbol or babe thing doesn't bother me.
- My husband travels a lot with his job, so we have a lot of frequent flyer miles so we can hop on a plane with no notice. That's a nice luxury and he is very supportive.
- West Hollywood is predominantly gay, so every man that came into the grocery store was shopping for his boyfriend.
- That's what makes a character interesting from an actor's perspective - the more screwed up, the better.
- It might be arrogant to think that we're the only living creations in all of the solar systems that there are. Space is so vast.
- I've loved the escapism of being another person, slipping into another character for a little while.
- It doesn't bother me that Seven has such an overtly sexual presence, because she has no concept of what effect that physical package would have on some male member of the crew. That's what's fun, her innocence.
- I'm not real impressed with the Star Trek weaponry, I gotta be honest.
- I have no specific ideas in mind of what I will or won't do; it's all about the roles.

- My background has been very helpful for this experience. But everyone was so accommodating because they knew it's not the most comfortable position to be the new kid.
- This was truly guerilla filmmaking. We shot out in the middle of nowhere in a place called Delta Flats, where basically every day was some new minor catastrophe.
- There is a very large chunk of our population who firmly believe in extraterrestrials.
- I get to pretend I'm flying into space, and hang out with my friends. That's what I do for a living.
- It was really a pleasure to play someone who's literally pushed past her breaking point repeatedly.
- The entire season, the show had never been aired for more than three weeks. You can't get an audience that way. They would never promo the show for the next week.
- I'm not seeking out genre films, but this just came my way, and Miramax was good enough to add a role for me because we wanted the chance to work together.
- I started by looking everything up in a Star Trek dictionary so I knew what I was talking about, but you can't do that because they talk in circles, and half of it doesn't make sense, so you'll just end up driving yourself more insane.
- I was always a fan of horror films as a kid.
- I think the more stressful our times get, the more we look for fantasy escapes.
- It's supposed to be entertainment. It's not supposed to be a documentary.
- The costume that I wear on the show is a little snug and doesn't leave a whole lot to the imagination. I don't have a problem with it because of the way this character's been written.
- They said that Seven was a former Borg who had been human and had been assimilated. She was regaining her humanity. I had no interest in this character.
- I have a lot of fun with guns, especially the M-16, but my favourite is my little .22. It fits nicely in the palm of your hand. I do limit myself to blanks.
- I've always wanted to do this, so it really is a dream come true.
- I would defy people to find a more beautifully developed character than Seven of Nine.
- I had never seen much of Star Trek, or any other science fiction, before I was cast. But Seven's wonderful.
