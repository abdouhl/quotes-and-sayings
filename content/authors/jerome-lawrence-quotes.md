- You must not demand the failure of your peers, because the more good things that are around in film, in television, in theater - why the better it is for all of us.
- Our only competition in the theater is boredom, because if I'm bored with a play, if I'm revolted by a play on stage, with the Broadway prices, especially today, I'm going to walk out and not come back and pay that price again.
- It's always such a joy that you wake up in the morning and there's work to do.
- A play is a passion.
- The whole point of writing is to have something in your gut or in your soul or in your mind that's burning to be written.
- In no instance is there to be a musical or opera of Inherit the Wind because it doesn't sing. It's an intellectual play.
- If you're going to make a musical, don't cartoon it from the play. Make it better than the play. Have a reason for making it sing.
- The aftermath of the war is what inspired us to write many of our plays. The whole reason for our writing Inherit the Wind was that we were appalled at the blacklisting. We were appalled at thought control.
- I think enthusiasm is the answer to passionate writing.
- Life is a banquet, and most poor suckers are starving to death.
- A neurotic is a man who builds a castle in the air. A psychotic is the man who lives in it. A psychiatrist is the man who collects the rent.
- All experience helps when you write.
- The man who has everything figured out is probably a fool.
