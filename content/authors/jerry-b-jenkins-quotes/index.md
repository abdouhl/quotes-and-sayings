- I put off writing the first Left Behind book for a year because I got invited to assist Billy Graham in his memoirs, and had we known what we were putting off for a year, we might not have put it off.
- Left Behind takes what to some people may be unbelievable predictions from the Bible and shows how they might play out. It makes the events of biblical prophecy understandable and thus believable.
- Actually 'Soon' has more than the Left Behind series, but I really believe less is more.
- Funny, I don't feel any more powerful today than yesterday.
- Good fiction must be entertaining, but what makes fiction special - and True - is that the realness of a novel allows it to carry a larger message.
- When you come to Christ as a real young person, I think when you become a teen-ager either you rebel or you search, doubt, and wonder.
- I was raised as a Christian but the transaction has to be made by yourself - you and God - at some point.
- While writing my first 90 books, I was magazine editor, publisher, book publisher, executive, etc., so I was established in publishing. three of my seven or so books were biographies of sports stars and really opened doors for me in that area.
- As for dialogue, I think it keeps things moving to cut to the chase.
- I don't see success as the goal. Obedience is the goal.
- I was raised in a Christian home and, in fact, my mother led me to Christ as a youngster.
- The uninitiated have real questions and valid concerns over how the things of God appear to them.
- Ironically, in today's marketplace successful nonfiction has to be unbelievable, while successful fiction must be believable.
- The Christian market has less competition and lower standards.
- In the prequel we're going to tell about the characters before Left Behind, and the book would end with the rapture instead of start with the rapture like the first one did.
- Books that do a tenth of what Left Behind has done are smashing successes.
- I fear it's because religion is man's attempt to reach God, and when he feels he has succeeded, he cannot abide anyone else's claim to have done the same.
- My dream remains to inform and entertain through fiction in the form of novels and movies that compete in the marketplace of ideas.
- It's made me more expectant of the imminent return of Jesus, and also more sensitive to the people around me. Knowing Jesus will return soon makes me want all the more to tell people about him and all that he offers.
- Broken relationships are a source of heavy heartbreak that seem to affect every family.
- Tim sends me a fairly ambitious workup in notebook form noting the passages we're going to cover and the chronology of the biblical events, and his commentaries on those things he's read and written.
- Writers write. Dreamers talk about it.
- SOON was the first novel where I used a rough outline. Usually I have characters and an idea and write as a process of discovery. Like working without a net.
- Gil Thorpe is a great diversion and is to book writing as poetry is to prose.
- I love inventing worlds and characters and settings and scenarios.
- When I was a junior camp counselor and it was my job to tell the campers a bedtime story or devotional, I would tell them a rapture story.
- He just kind of talks them through, and then I get the fun part cause I get to make up the stories.
- I've written enough books with real celebrities, such as Walter Payton and Hank Aaron and Billy Graham, to know that fame looks good only to people who don't have it.
- There is a comfort zone of knowing where things are going and having characters in place, but the action gets more and more dramatic and is very challenging to describe.
- In my opinion, Jesus is God's attempt to reach man. But while I believe Jesus is the way to God, it makes no sense to hate people who disagree.
- Of course, bad marriages are so pervasive that they have invaded the faith community too.
- The theater of the mind is impossible to compete with, and I like the idea that with a few suggestions, each reader forms in his or her own mind what a character or a place looks like.
- People want to find out what happens to the characters, and want to keep reading, and turning the pages.
- Fiction has a unique role in conveying Truth. In fact, only fiction that is Truth with a capital T is worthwhile.
- People are scared to death and they're looking for something beyond themselves.
