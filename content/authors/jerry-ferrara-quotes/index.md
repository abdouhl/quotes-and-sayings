- I got on the scale and I weighed around 203. I'm only 5'7. I was about to turn 30, and I wasn't active anymore. So I started working with a nutritionist and a trainer. I played basketball twice a week. And soon it all just became a habit for me. I became addicted to something good for a change.
- I do appreciate a woman who has a passion for sports and knows their stuff.
- 'The Sopranos,' for instance, is arguably the best cable show of all time. They could have made a movie, but that show ended so perfectly, it would almost be a disadvantage to make a movie like that. Then again, if you made a 'Sopranos' movie, people would be lined around the block to go see it.
- Any actor who is being honest will admit there's always a small or large part of the real you in every character. It's impossible not to have that.
- I was so honored to be on 'Entourage' for eight years but I want to show people that I can do other things.
- My biggest pet peeve are just girls who go to sports bars who have no intention on caring what teams are playing, like they're looking for just a night out. That drives me more crazy than anything else. Like, don't pretend to be a sports fan.
- I can only speak for myself - I don't care how I look.
- I'm just a seasonal guy. Basketball, football, baseball, boxing, golf. Give it to me all the time.
- If you want something, have it. If you feel like it's forbidden, you'll want it even more. Whenever I have a craving, I go and have it and just make sure I don't have it again the next day.
- I gave up so many things. It wasn't that I was out of control - it was just years of eating anything I wanted. I wouldn't eat a whole pizza, but if I wanted pizza two or three times a week, I didn't think to limit myself. So I just cut out all the stuff that I viewed as unhealthy.
