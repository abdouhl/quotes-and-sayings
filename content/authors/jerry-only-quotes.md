- The main thing is that this band keeps going.
- I discovered the Clash, the Pistols, obviously the Ramones, Blondie.
- I would have hated to been locked into music for the last 20 years and not been able to have a family.
- There were some situations where I was giving up everything I had for the band and I just expected everybody else to feel the same way. I realized I was just kidding myself.
- My job is not babysitting people; my job is focusing on making the best band I possibly can.
- I might not be Shaq, but I can be Kobe, you know?
- We were watching bands like the Ramones and Blondie and other bands beginning to ignite.
- It's not how many tickets can we sell, it's where do we want to play, not where should we play to make the most money. We don't really care about that.
- Look at all the Misfits products that came out. We never made a dime off it.
- We have a problem now with parents stealing their kids' CDs, so the roles have been reversed.
- The packaging has to really sell the product today, because kids can go out and buy a CD and then 10 kids can burn them. So you have to really be on your toes.
- We're gonna try and bring on all the different aspects of horror movie making and bring on guests and show all these old '50's B movies. Not the real corny ones, the real cool ones.
- With us, it's a very specific audience. If you like steak, this is it for you.
- The new album is a childhood dream come true. Got to sing with Ronnie Spector, got to cover a bunch of songs that were influential in drawing a line between the punk form and original rock and roll.
- The Ramones went through a couple different line-up changes, and Johnny and Joey held through the whole thing. So right now I'm the only one hanging in there.
- We've been through about a million different line-ups throughout our career.
- If we were to hit the level that Metallica or somebody like that hit, we'd have had a hard time dealing with it. I think it would have been our doom. It's hard for anybody at that level.
- The Misfits pretty much funds the Misfits. It used to cost me money to be in the band. I think we got paid the last gig we ever did. After that, we had to work to support our families.
- It's time to start really writing some stuff, and I really wanted to write some stuff in the vein of the original Misfits, and this was really the first step in that direction.
- We got dragged through a system and got burned by crooked lawyers, and the list goes on and on.
- Danny and I wrote 10 songs in seven days, which I thought might be close to the record until you probably look at some of the Beatles statistics.
- If you really want something you just hang with it. We think our future's ahead and not behind.
- I believe in God.
- Don't buy the bootlegs, save your stuff, everything's coming back out.
- Music shouldn't be based around money or politics. Music should be a bunch of people that really do great songs together doing them together for the pursuit of having a good time.
