- I grew up in a town outside of Waco, Texas, and we had 30 acres.
- I love music and songwriters from the '60s and '70s.
- I get a little freaked out when I'm around too many redheads. I only have about one or two red-haired friends, and when a bunch of us get together, I feel like there's going to be a fight that breaks out or something.
- Right after 'Friday Night Lights' ended, I was in sort of an existential crisis.
- I'm open to all religions. Respecting Scientology is just like respecting any other religious view.
- Ade Palicki is a wonderful actress, so it was fun to work with her.
- I'm always open to anything. I haven't been that selective, I've just been fortunate to get projects I'm excited about. It's a little bizarre being a part of things that you really, really enjoy.
- My focus is to grow, have fun, and work with people who inspire me, like Philip Seymour Hoffman.
- I don't think I'm a slacker, but I don't have aspirations to, like, conquer Hollywood. Or the world. Or anything.
- It seems to work out that following anything you do, you are pretty much approached with versions of the last thing people saw you in.
- I sing a little bit. I got a guitar for my 16th birthday.
- Awards shows... I just feel like a fish out of water at those things.
- There are early videos of me at three years old with a tiny guitar trying to sing 'Friends in Low Places' by Garth Brooks.
- The reason you want to act is to continue to explore every different part of the human psyche.
- I love playing guitar. I grew up with my dad playing. But acting is definitely the forefront, I guess I'd say, in terms of career and something that I really enjoy and feel lucky to be able to do.
- I didn't really start doing stuff until I was 8 or so, but I was an extra in a bunch of different movies, and I just really took to it and really enjoyed it. I kind of bugged my parents to give L.A. a shot, and they were just super-supportive.
- I guess I would like to play some more extroverts.
- With 'Friday Night Lights,' we were encouraged to make it our own and improvise as much as we wanted.
- I played lots of bullies when I was a kid.
- I grew up half the time in a small town called Mart, Texas, and half the time in L.A., because I was acting.
- I'm interested in people that can say one thing and have completely different motives behind that.
- I grew up in a tiny town in Texas, so I understood the world of high school football.
- I played with a band in Austin when I was doing 'Friday Night Lights.' It was a blast.
- 'Grey's Anatomy,' that was a great show to be part of, but they work really long hours. They were all just really tired. Just worn out.
- I think that's the great thing about all 'Black Mirror' episodes - it really leaves you with this feeling of not knowing how to feel.
- I deleted my Facebook account when I was 19 because it didn't bring out good qualities in me. I figured, 'Well my mom's got a Facebook. If people want to find me, they can go through her.'
- I will say, I'm a great, great, great grandson of Stephen F. Austin. He founded Austin, Texas, which is kind of cool.
- Usually, nerds on TV are completely stereotypical, like Urkel, or they're not really so nerdy.
- I think it would be fun to walk around in Bill Murray's mind for a while.
- I don't feel competitive toward other actors. I'm competitive with myself.
- I did a Coca-Cola commercial when I was about two and a half years old, and then me and my family were extras in a bunch of Westerns. I loved dressing up and stepping into this imaginary world, and it was fun to get outside of my tiny little town with a bunch of movie weirdos.
- 'Breaking Bad' is great at blurring the line between good and evil. It makes you feel compassion for Walter White so you're with him throughout this descent into the darker parts of his psyche. The bad that we're capable of is all circumstantial.
- I'm going to try to keep believing that if you do good work, people will keep calling. Whenever that fails, I'll just start going nuts on Twitter.
- 'Lonesome Dove' was the movie. I watched that over and over and over again, and I know every line. It was one that I loved as a kid for all the horses and characters that went over my head, but then the older I got, I realized how amazing it was on so many other different levels - Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones' relationship.
- I was 3 and a half, and there was an open call for a Coca-Cola commercial. We were living around Dallas, and my mom took me. I think they were calling for 16-year-olds that could ride horses and swing a rope, and for whatever reason, my mom took me up there when I was 3. But I always had a rope, and I was a little cowboy at that age.
- Every role I take on, I try and bring my best and to be as honest as possible. I try not to repeat things I've done in the past. Which gets harder and harder.
- In middle school, I played quarterback. I was at a tiny school, so you played offense and defense - I played linebacker, and in high school I stopped playing around my sophomore year because of my acting stuff.
- I look at someone like Chris Pratt with such admiration.
- 'Friday Night Lights' was kind of like my college years because I did four seasons of that. It was my first series. It was the most time I had with one character, and kind of growing and evolving with the character over that long of a span of time, it just allows you to sort of learn in a completely different way that I had never experienced.
- My dad, who I'm very close to, is one of those men where once you're in, once he loves you, that's it, no questions about it.
- People can rationalize in funny ways to hold onto their dreams and needs.
- It would drive me crazy if I picked roles with the goal of being a leading man. You never know what you're getting into when you sign onto a project, and more times than not, the characters that are close to the leading man are more interesting and more fun to play.
