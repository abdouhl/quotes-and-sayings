- Open-water swimming scares the hell out of me.
- I was trained classically in violin and voice, which led to musical theater. Then I left the music scene to chase acting, which is when 'Neighbours' came along. It was a fantastic playground for actors, and the cast around me taught me a lot.

- I live in a fantasy world where I think I'm immune to all disease. I don't get sick and haven't had anything major go wrong.
