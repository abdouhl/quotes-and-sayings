- I think you have to respect every fighter.
- I'm very close to Poliana Botelho, Virna Jandiroba and Amanda Ribas, too. It's like I always tell them: 'If we're going to fight, it might as well be for the belt. I don't want to fight you in a normal fight.'

That's why I want to be fighting all the time, to show that I'm the best, that I'm evolving, because the more you show, the more you get paid.

- When I entered the UFC, there was only the bantamweight division. I had some good fights there, and then I decided to go to the strawweight division, where I became a champion.

- People think I'm rich. Well, I'm not.

- I'll do whatever the UFC tells me. They are giving me tough girls, and I'm doing great fights, so I'll continue this way.

- If they want me against Jessica Eye, that's great. I will watch her fights and train hard to do another exciting fight for the fans.
- We only get paid when we fight, and we have to save money until the next fight.
- You see, where I'm from, fighting is simply not a 'girl's thing.' In Umuarama, I grew up playing football, which to my family was also not a girl's thing, to be honest. Playing football was my biggest passion. I wanted to be on TV, to be just like Marta. I even had a knack for it.

- It's hard to have a good career in soccer, especially women's soccer.
- Joanna is a great athlete, has good grappling, good striking, a lot of cardio, but her punching power is weak.

- Becoming champion was great and completely changed my life financially.
- When I started fighting MMA, I saw I could make some money with it.
