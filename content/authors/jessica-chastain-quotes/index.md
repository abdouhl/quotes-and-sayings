- If you're one of the only women on a set - if it's you and a bunch of men - you feel like your value doesn't come from your thoughts and your talent and what you say: your value comes from how you look and how you're perceived by the men around you.

- What I do now, when I'm taking on a film, I always ask about the fairness of the pay. I ask what they're offering me in comparison to the guy. I don't care about how much I get paid; I'm in an industry where we're overcompensated for the work we do.
- I grew up poor.

- If I'm in Italy, I'll have an espresso, but I try not to get my energy from things like that.
- We have grown up watching women be used as props on a man's journey. It's not our fault that that's what we saw as children. But we need to acknowledge that and do better.
- I just want to see more women in film and behind the camera. I'm tired of seeing movies from one perspective.
- For the most part, I was surprised by the representation of female characters onscreen. I do hope that when we include more female storytellers, we will have more of the women that I recognize in my day to day life.
- I am not one to go for traditional female roles, because I don't think traditionally female characters are very interesting, and I don't think they represent real life.

- Some people think I've had a nose job. I've never had anything like that done, but I have no judgement of anyone that does.
- Everyone has to learn how to live in an environment that has not made it easy for women to claim their place, so I think it's all women's responsibility to step forward.
- The power of 'no' means you're educating people in how to treat you.
- In the characters that I play, I'm so involved in the look; it's very, very important to me. Because how a person presents him or herself to the world, they're saying something about themselves. It's their first form of advertisement.
- As an actor, I have a lot of fear, thinking that if I speak my mind, or something that feels like it deviates from the norm as a woman, am I going to be made to disappear in my industry?
