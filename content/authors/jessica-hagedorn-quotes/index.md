- Music is very influential to my writing, as are theater and film.
- There is real beauty in my eyes when I lose my mind.
- I'm part Spanish. My paternal grandfather came from Spain via Singapore to Manila. On my mother's side it's more mixture, with a Filipino mother and a father who was Scotch Irish-French; you know, white American hybrid. And I also have on my father's side a great-great-grandmother who was Chinese. So, I'm a hybrid.
- I have been definitely influenced more by Latin American writers than by any other type of writer. They are very close in terms of voice - their humor, their fatalism, their... well, that over-used term 'magical realism.' It's a wonderful term that's just been used so much, we don't know what it means anymore.
- I love writing dialogue, and I think a lot of my writing is visual and very cinematic.
- I don't believe in sampling some Tibetan music just to make it sound groovy, but you do your homework, you understand what you're doing with it.
- I also identify as a Latin person, a person who has Latin blood.
- My identity is linked to my grandmother, who's pure Filipino, as pure as you can probably get. And that shaped my imagination. So that's how I identify.
- Growing up in the Philippines, I loved all kinds of movies. We had a very healthy film industry there when I was a child.
- Becoming a mother has helped make me a tougher, stronger writer.
- Everything matters. Time is precious.
- I think for a lot of so-called post-colonial peoples, there's a feeling of not being quite legitimate, of not being pure enough.
- There are certain regions in the country where the indigenous people eat dogs.
- I'm an underdog person, so I align myself with those who seem to be not considered valuable in polite society.
- Life is not simple, and people can't be boxed into being either heroes or villains.
- But I think there's a genuine joy, too, a sense that no matter what, even if my stomach's growling, I'm going to dance. That's what I want to leave people with at the end of the play. After all this, people still know how to live.
- I'm preparing for a multimedia theater piece, Airport Music, that's coming up in New York City.
- I don't know what issues concerning identity have helped contemporary fiction evolve to what it is now. All I know is that the range of voices that are being heard and published is a lot more diverse than when I was coming up.
- Hybridity keeps me from being rigid about most things. It has taught me to appreciate the contradictions in the world and in my life. I scavenge from the best.
- We didn't have television until I was about eight years old, so it was either the movies or radio. A lot of radio drama. That was our television, you know. We had to use our imagination. So it was really those two things, and the comics, that I immersed myself in as a child.
- There were also horror shows on the radio. Very terrifying and thrilling to me as a kid. They had all these creepy sound effects. They would come on at ten o'clock at night, and I just would scare myself to death.
