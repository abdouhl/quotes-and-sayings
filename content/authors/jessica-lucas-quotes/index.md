- I would love to go into musicals. I got a chance to sing in 'Big Momma's House,' and that's something I would love to do more. But only in Broadway or in the movies. I don't think I would ever seek a career as a singer.
- L.A. can be very superficial, and it's hard to meet cool people here. I try to stay away from the glitzy side of the business and have a normal life as much as possible. I keep to myself.
- As much as I like watching horror films, I never thought I would act in them.
- If you're going to be a zombie in a movie, you go big or go home.
- As I get older, I'm more comfortable in my skin.
- I guess you can consider photo shoots modeling, but it's never really interested me. I find it somewhat boring, actually. It wouldn't be something I would do.
- I started in community theater at 7 years old. I loved being on stage and performing. At the time, I didn't correlate that the stuff I was doing on stage was the same thing that I was watching in my favorite films.
- I'm not going to date a crazy party animal; I'm more into culture. I'd rather go to a museum, travel somewhere, or go to a play. That's more interesting to me than partying at the hottest club.
- What I noticed about L.A. is that people try to hit on you in your car. It's incredibly creepy to be in a car and have the guy next to you roll down his window.
