- I like throwing on shorts and a plaid button up with messy hair and last night's eyeliner and sunglasses and wandering the town. And if there's a guy I dig with his arm around me, too, that's pretty nice.
- I watch people around me not drinking any water all day, and I turn into the water police. I'm constantly asking, 'Are you drinking water?' Being dehydrated very quickly affects my energy.
- I would never manipulate somebody and put somebody in peril so that I could get rich off of it.
- I like when a man has a positive self-image, no matter what he looks like. I'm not into rock-hard abs.
- I love scary movies! My two favorites are pretty neck and neck: 'The Orphanage' and 'The Strangers.'

- I hate to cook, but I love to eat. I would want to be able to conjure yummy and healthy meals by wiggling my nose!
- I love 'The Orphanage' because the concept is so cool and the story is told in such an interesting way. It's a movie that will scare your socks off but make you cry at the end. It's one of the most tragic movies I've ever watched and is truly heartbreaking and scary at the same time.

- Thankfully, I've never had anyone tell me that I needed to lose weight or change my appearance.
- We have to think beyond ourselves.
- I always make sure to eat a healthy breakfast because it's the first meal you eat that fuels your body for the rest of the day. Plus, breakfast is the perfect time to get away with eating carbs because they'll be burned off before the day is done, so every now and then I splurge on a Belgian waffle - my favorite!
- I like timeless and classic pieces with an interesting and modern twist. And I love a little funk!
- I'm usually attracted to more interesting types of men. I have no desire to be with a cookie-cutter Ken doll.
- When I was younger, the idea of the bad boy was appealing, but then I grew up and realized that stable people are more fulfilling. Bad boys need more time to themselves. I want to be in a relationship with someone who knows how to take care of himself and is therefore able to take care of me. That way, we can put each other first.
- I'm an only child raised by a single mom. She's always been supportive of what I wanted to do.
- I think a lot of adults are kind of set in their ways. My mom is always changing. She's excited to learn.
- Starz has been nothing but amazing to me.
