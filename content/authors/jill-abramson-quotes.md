- There's a way to do networking that isn't overly brown-nosing.

- Budget cuts are a sad reality in most newsrooms, and I am concerned that they reduce the collective muscle of journalists who are doing the expensive, and often dangerous, work of on-the-ground reporting.
- I am in awe of women who have full family lives and seem to work round the clock in the 24/7 news cycle.
