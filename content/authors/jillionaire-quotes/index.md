- Honestly, so much of that EDM stuff is just so disposable.
- There's this Afghani kid in Stockholm called Phat Deuce who's started sending us his music, and he's amazing.
- I love coming to Australia. It's one of my favourite places.
- When you have your own place, you set your own rules.
- The thing about places like Trinidad and Jamaica is that they can be very musically insular. There isn't much space for kids making hip-hop, electronic music, or hybrid genres.
- I try to stay at the same spots all the time, so they remember me.
- Major Lazer has always been a culture mashup, and to us, India feels like some kind of special creature with one foot in history and one firmly in the future.
- It's nice to see a friendly face or have someone know your name.
- India is special, and its beauty absolutely humbled us. When we toured there as Major Lazer, it was mind-blowing to see our fan-base.
- Fabulous is familiarity.
- The generation that comes next is always going to rebel against the generation that came before, and they're always going to be at odds with each other.
- I've been a fan of Bunji's freestyling since the first time I saw him perform, back in the early 2000s.
- If you're going to go to a festival, drink water for six days before you get there.
- I think the biggest part of being on a sound system is wanting to always be the best.
- In terms of brands, I generally try to stick with EDITION Hotels or Soho House. That way, I know what I'm getting myself into. Plus, the lobbies and bath soaps smell the same - if you're into that kinda thing, which I am.
- In Brazil, you buy tickets to go to the stadium to watch the carnival, but in Trinidad, you buy a costume and take part. There are very few things that can rival that experience.
- Australians are crazy, man! Every night, I feel like I'm in a scene from Brad Pitt's 'World War Z'... the kids are going to figure out a way to from a zombie rave ladder over the plexiglass and come into the DJ booth and eat me alive... Not in a bad way at all.
- Music's always going to evolve, and we can't really stop that, so we have to figure out what's the next thing and how we move towards that as opposed to just being like, 'Oh, cool: let's just continue making tear-out EDM hits that are gonna last 2 months, and then somebody else is making the exact same thing under a different name.'
- You have to support people who want to do weird, different, fun stuff. Otherwise, it'll get very homogenous.
