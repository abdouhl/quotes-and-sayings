- There's a lot of dynamics that can really break a human down.
- Vulnerability, humility, relatability - those three are very close and very similar to keep you going.
- I'm a huge fan of Giuliani, as a person. Down-to-earth, talks to you like a human.
- As a kid, we were outdoors as much as possible.
- I have a deep respect for life in general; just a huge, deep respect for life. And I have definitely grasped onto the fact that every minute, every moment, to be grateful and thankful for. Because we really don't know what's two seconds away. We really don't. It's so unpredictable.

- I realized I don't want anyone to control my destiny, whether it's a network TV show or not. I would rather invest in my own projects and if they fail, they fail on their own merits, not because somebody else mangled it.
- The energy of the metal is what I've always loved and the energy I do on stage with standup, I mean, I'm not Metallica, but I've always extremely attracted and driven by that energy and the thought-provoking lyrics and drive. That's an attitude every standup show I go in. I go in to crush your face.
- To me, those three are the revolutionaries. Richard Pryor was honest, raw. George Carlin was brilliant. He was also deep, fearless. And Sam Kinison was another one who went deeper and he revolutionized the angle of tackling humor with the whole rock star element of yelling and screaming, which was hilarious.
- It's bizarre how the most powerful, moving things in the world, there's no money. But that's going to be the most uplifting thing in anyone's life. There's not going to be a paycheck.
- I have a weird fan base, people from all over the place for some reason.
- Marriage is work. Get it out of your thick skull that marriage is, 'Oh, we got married and now we just live forever wonderfully.' It's work. It's just like starting a business: You're going to bicker with your business partner, but you don't leave the business partner. You work it out.

- I can do four shows in a row singing no problem. Four shows in a row stand up, my voice is destroyed. I'm a storyteller so I act out a lot of characters and I act out a lot of situations and I'm distorting my voice and imitating characters I run into. I'm actually more exhausted doing that than I am with the rock shows, believe it or not.
- The faith world to me is like a radio station. It's there. And if you want to plug in and listen to it, kind of tune into it, it can definitely be helpful. I don't know if it's an energy? I don't know what it is, but it fascinates me.

- If I can bring you to the point where you're almost in tears one minute and laughing so hard the next and you've healed a bit at the same time, that's when I get to use the gift I was given.
- Brian Johnson is the reason I became a Bon Scott fan.
- There's not a lot of comics with anything to say. It's entertaining, but when you think of Chris Rock, Richard Pryor or Bill Cosby, they all had something to say.

- One of the things I did, I would go, 'Dad, I know you don't know how to work YouTube, but wait until you see this concert. I found Hank Williams in 1940. And look at this.' Then that brings on memories and it brings happiness and it gives him a little extra breath in life.
- I like old-school, riff-driven, hard rock music with big hooks!
- I'm not going to make fun of something that has badly traumatized someone's life.
- I grew up Valley Stream until my parents moved to Florida when I was 20. I graduated from Valley Stream Central High School in 1985. It was the best childhood anyone could ever ask for.

- I was hoping for big TV, film, and this and that, but stand-up was the only thing I knew.

- There are so many people that, as I go across the country, say, 'I was a student and I used to come see you.'
- I'm the corner street storytelling guy. I'm the guy in the garage that the neighbors come over to talk to and I keep you entertained for hours.
- I don't bring politics, religion or media to the table.
- I was a very naive kid. I didn't know there were people living in closets in Hollywood.

- The truth hurts but it has to be heard.
- Kids are like roosters, up at the first sign of dawn.
- Volbeat is one of those bands, where as soon as I hear them, I know who it is. It sounds like Elvis - backed by a Metal band.
- On stage, you have the instant reaction. I'm in control of my own destiny up there. If I fail, I can always say, 'I should have read that audience better. I don't know why I went in that direction.' In the commercial world, you're not writing your character.

- On the DVD 'Hardcore,' half the material was about me growing up in Valley Stream.
- I wanted to travel and I was fascinated with stand-up and I just knew nothing was ever going to stop me from doing it. My mom tried to, she'd say 'You need to go to school and have a back up.' Nah, mom, this is it.

- Everywhere I go, I feel the city out. I walk around and get there early, and I go off the cuff with whatever's going on in town.
- Obviously, being a diehard Mets fan, my passion is a given, but I also love playing baseball. I hadn't been able to participate since high school, when the game became a little too fast for me.
- The Mets represent life and the reality of life, the winning, the losing, the hope, the faith. You stick with them through the ups and the downs, the heartbreaks. Every year you always have hope. You always have faith, even when they break your heart. You get mad, but you stick with them. They're humbling.
- My dream was to be the biggest comic with the biggest band, touring together.
- I found myself trying to appeal to the 'Half Baked' crowd and I wasn't that guy. It's like dressing up as Batman every day. It's not Halloween every day. It's fun on Halloween, but I can't dress up in that outfit every day when I'm not that anymore or never was that guy.
- Past? I never look back to the past.
- I can't see myself every leaving. I love New Jersey.
- I started out in 1989 doing open mic nights. The first 10 years, I was literally all about I'm going to be a star. I want leather pants, I want a kangaroo, I want to be on 'MTV Cribs,' I want to go to the mall with a pet monkey and I want everyone to go, 'Wow, that guy's huge, he's successful.'
- I learned more about my father in his last 5 to 6 years than I ever did my whole lifetime.

- I'm a family guy who grew up with metal, and even though I'm domesticated I still have this in me.
- I've got a very wide sense of humor.
- People are surprised that I'm married.
- My eyelids cover half my face.
- I met Jack Nicholson, who lived up to his persona, and when we met, he lifted the sunglasses he was wearing at 2 in the morning, and giggling, he told me, 'You look the way I feel all the time.'
- Before I even got 'Saturday Night Live,' I was already known as the furthest thing from a goat boy. I had a stand-up routine, which I was all ready to do on HBO, before 'Saturday Night Live,' so if my routine was dependent on being a goat, I would want to quit.
- Me and my wife started with absolutely nothing.
- The greatest thing that I had in my life was those moments with my dad that I sacrificed. I looked at him as a soldier. He's a wounded soldier. It's my duty as a human to take care of this soldier.

- I never left my street until I was 16 years old. I didn't have to. I was entertained on that street forever. We were outside all day. The only reason to go inside was to sleep and eat.
- SNL' pushed my limits. It was great. It taught me about fame, it taught me about the business; it was definitely the best experience, or one of the best, that I've had so far. It was a primer for what was to come and what I want out of life.
- Laughter is what connects pretty much all pain.
- I don't follow politics. I don't read news and I don't watch TV.
