- Next time we need to be on drugs and have lots of suffering and alcohol abuse going on while recording, I'm kinda picturing a Jerry Lee Lewis session from the mid Seventies.
- Most modern stuff I hear kinda sucks, someone should turn me onto something good, fast!
- All I know is that when I mix to digital and when I mix to tape I compare them and the tape always wins out.
- I'm delighted to be Number 1, but next week I don't want people to buy my record, I want them to buy Band Aid.
- Hey bands, you're all welcome to fly me to some exotic location and I'll record you there, Y'know that right? You don't have to come to this God forsaken place. Hope I can visit you all in Australia one of these days that would be hot! We'll talk again soon.
- In postscript let's just say that I am very fortunate cause I've gotten to work with a lot of great bands!
- I can write music but I'm not much for words.
- I am on sabbatical as of right now, been too busy to think of about my OWN needs as of late.
