- I don't think many of us face the same sort of physical adventures our ancestors did, at least not on a daily basis.
- I've written fiction... but the nonfiction has always received the most attention.
- When you spend a year or two researching a subject, and you're still fascinated by it, that's a good indicator that what you're doing will appeal to others, as well.
- 'West To A Land Of Plenty' shows a family heading west, first on board a train, and then going into areas as yet untamed by rail by way of an ox-drawn wagon.
- There are a number of things everyone can do to help protect whales.
- History often reads as a hard and grim experience. But people are remarkably resilient and funny, even when the going is very hard.
- A move to a different town or school gives us new places to explore, new people to meet; a lost pet means we have to organize a careful search; baby-sitting requires looking out for dangers a young child can't foresee; a car crash or fire demands that we get help immediately.

- We will never know exactly how many women disguised themselves as men and fought in the Civil War. At the close of the hostilities, it was estimated that approximately 400 women had managed to enlist, but this number is almost certainly too low.
