- I was hoping for it to be possibly a movie career as I still would like to see that happen. I enjoyed making 200 Motels and did try out for a few things when I lived in LA, but nothing ever happened. I'm still hoping though.
- I know I didn't like that dress 'cause it didn't fit but I thought it was a great picture. We weren't the first band to do a picture in drag; The Rolling Stones were. If it was good enough for them then it had to be good enough for us.
- My webmaster lives in Munich and is a very dear friend of mine. He is doing a great job on the site and it is constantly being updated and always will.
- I haven't seen or spoken to Ray Collins in at least 10 years so I don't even know if he's alive. I hope so.
- The fans have been very nice to me and I might say that all those fans that Frank said went away is not so.
- I don't know how Frank presented the old Mothers, since I never read the book. There might be some opinions on what he said, but I - or anyone else - could not make any corrections to anything Frank did.
- I use Windows; '98 second edition and it works very good for me. You know, I just started on the computer about 9 months ago and am fascinated with the possibilities. I don't know what I would do without it now.
- I've done every tour with them since then and will always be with them as long as they're together.
- I think that the old Mothers started that trend of rehearsing long hours. We went as long as the later bands did except we didn't get paid for it like they did.
- Most people are really cool and I really don't mind talking to them and answering their questions.
- I've been writing Indian music for a while. Indian music is about Mother Earth, and mine is no exception.
- I really don't have a theme when I start a sculpture. The rock guides me to the final sculpture. I think that is true for many creative sculpture artists.
- We never got anything out of the recordings. I'm still as broke as I was when I was with the Mothers.
- I think a lot of the Mothers stuff that we recorded was written while we were on the road.
- In my opinion, Lenny Bruce was more of an influence on Zappa's satirical lyric's than anyone that I know of.
- Hendrix was big in England. We all became good friends and I am still in touch with Noel Redding.
- As far as me knowing if Frank was a genius - in those days, I thought Einstein was the only genius around.
- First of all; Frank was the BOSS. We didn't question any of his motives or decisions at the time.
- I went to work with a guy named Matt Fuller, who was a Mothers fan, and low and behold, Arthur was working for him also. We worked together for about six months and decided to strike out on our own.
- I would have told him that I appreciated his friendship through the years and that I had learned a lot from him. I really loved Frank like you do a brother.
- It was a wild time - a time that I don't miss anymore. But then again, I'm 62 years old now and I think that lifestyle would probably put me where Frank's at now.
- It would make me feel that creative art has a chance in this crazy world that we all live in.
- Watch MTV and you can see what the music scene is like in England. The Spice Girls? Not a lot of creativity in the commercial area. There are still great musicians in England, but not a lot being heard that much.
- I got married about three years ago again to a wonderful German woman. Her name is Monika and she is beautiful. She is one of the biggest women Zappa fans I have ever met in my life.
- I had pretty much raised my kids and my first wife and I were divorced, so I began, in earnest, to start my musical career again. Going for the big record deal and all of that.
- When some guy shows up with a shopping bag full of records and CD's and wants me to sign every one plus fifteen pieces of blank paper I wonder what the hell is he doing with all of that?
- I'm doing it with a rock format and the words are about people living in harmony with Mother Earth. It's very important to me - and I feel it should be for every living human on this planet.
- We are not a Zappa cover band. We only play Frank's songs that were recorded by the Mothers of Invention and I think a lot of those songs were complex.
- Frank was the BOSS and was not open to anything that was not from his head. There were no arguments about music because if you did, he would show you where the door was. Period.
- My drum sticks are in the 'Hall of Fame.' I know that.
