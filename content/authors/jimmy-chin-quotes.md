- I really believe that, as human beings, we have an innate need to explore, to see what's around the corner.

- You can show up at Everest having never really climbed before, because it's like hiking, basically. You can't show up on Meru and start up the thing unless you have years and years of experience. Climbing and spending time on the mountains is really the only way you can train.
- As a professional climber, that's the question you always get: Why, why, why? It's an ineffable thing; you can't describe it.
- I feel like I'm doing what I love. If I can get out, shoot, film and climb, and be with my friends and family, I'm happy. It doesn't take a lot. I don't need to climb huge mountains. I have a deep connection with wilderness and the environment, and I'm thankful for that.

- I lose anywhere up to 20 pounds on location with adventurers like Conrad Anker or Brady Robinson.

And as I get older, it is far more important for me to be doing this and taking my conditioning seriously.

- I used to always judge other people's mistakes in the mountains. I think a bit differently now. Everybody's gotten away with a mistake or poor decision out there at one point or another, but sometimes it catches up to you, or sometimes you're just plain unlucky.
- I am always concerned with finding the right spot and the right shot, so sometimes I forget to appreciate the skill of my fellow adventurers, but I am aware of how my life has been changed by my ability with a camera.

- The best alpinists are the ones with the worst memories.
- I'm constantly out of my mind trying to stay in shape.

- The way we approached Meru, and the way we approach a lot of these mountains, is with humility. A sense of, 'Is it going to give us passage?' Your mental attitude can affect the outcome.
- My favorite off-mountain workout is the long run. It's great for building endurance and strength.
- It's hard to take people seriously who say you're totally irresponsible if you go out and climb mountains when you have kids, because they clearly don't understand the circumstances. You can't impose your own acceptance of risk on other people - that's not fair.
- Mountains are like the great equalizer. It doesn't matter who anyone is or what they do.
