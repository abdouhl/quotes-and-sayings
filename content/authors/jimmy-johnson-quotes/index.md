- In some ways 'Survivor' might have saved my life.
- I don't miss a minute of 'Survivor.'
- I know as a coach and a player we had three a day practices and that was physically taxing but at least we had food in our stomach and a good nights rest and plenty of cold water.
- I think as far as any kind of pressure on a football team or on an individual in professional sports really depends not only on that individual but the leadership they have on the team and the leadership they have on the coaching staff. A lot of times, they can divert some of those pressures off of the individual and off of the team.
- In fact, one of the conversations I had with Jason Garrett, you know, sometimes X's and O's get so complicated, and a coach gets so into that that he forgets the most important thing is players win ballgames. Make sure that the players are properly equipped and motivated to do their jobs.
- I don't want to lose the feeling I have for players, but the pro system almost causes you to be cold and insensitive, when you have to release players yearly.
- You can't be a sloppy football team and be successful in the NFL.
- Anybody who has ever been around me knows I'll give you my opinion.
- The only thing worse than a coach or CEO who doesn't care about his people is one who pretends to care. People can spot a phony every time.
- Football rewards the guys that are in great condition.
- An objective truth and individual reason are feared above all.
- Give people enough guidance to make the decisions you want them to make. Don't tell them what to do, but encourage them to do what is best.
- Treat a person as he is, and he will remain as he is. Treat a person as if he were where he could be and should be, and he will become what he could be and should be.
- Just following 'Survivor' over the years, sometimes if an individual is not a threat and he doesn't rub anybody the wrong way and he can get into an alliance, he can hang out there for a while.
- I was the personnel director there with the Cowboys.
- Elliott's bigger, stronger, maybe even a step faster than Emmitt Smith, but they're both very similar. I think, you know, Ezekiel Elliott is a more powerful runner. He runs over people. Both of 'em can make people miss, so you don't really get a big shot on 'em. But Elliott will take on tacklers, whereas, you know, Emmitt never did this.
- Of all the programs, I watch sporting events live and I watch 'Survivor' live. Everything else I TiVo.
- There is a way to practice hard and be physical without pads. You can still be a physical football team and be efficient in practice without pads. The 49ers practiced like that for a long period of time in the 1980s under Bill Walsh and were extremely successful when all the other teams were practicing in pads.
- Two to three years down the road, other companies not on a model like Dell's will be in trouble.
- And the main thing was that I wanted to live in south Florida. That's why I left the Cowboys; to live in south Florida.
- Like I always say, it's not how many great plays you make; it's how few bad ones you make. I know fans, and even some losing coaches, are enamored with long pass completions or the great run plays, but that doesn't offset the interception or the fumble.
- I can't confirm any rumors. I'm happy doing what I'm doing. I have no interest in going back to coaching.
- With 'Survivor' - I didn't get any sleep, there was no food, we had to boil our water... plus, it was physically taxing during the day. That's what made it more difficult than three-a-day practices.
- I could start a fire from scratch.
- Football is such a team sport, so no one individual does it. No one coach or no one assistant coach or no one player, it's a great team sport, so I don't get carried away with a bunch of accolades.
- I think the biggest thing was that when I was in college, I really concentrated on personnel. That was my strength, and I was, in essence, my own recruiting coordinator. And when I went to the pros, I did the same thing.
- I've heard all the coaches complaining about the new CBA rules limiting padded practice. I don't like the reduction to just 15 padded practices during the season. When I coached, we always practiced in pads; and three days a week.
- When I went to the Dolphins, we retained most of their coaching staff, and of course, we had a few veteran players. So, I just tried to add a few pieces here and there.
- I'm not really good with predicting.
- I'm really impressed with Kolb there in Philadelphia. He's a very talented quarterback.
- A head coach has to be able to oversee all facets of the team and of the game.
- You've got to make sure that every body's putting in the work and you've got to have the discipline to go out there and get the job done.
- Do you want to be safe and good, or do you want to take a chance and be great?
- But I was always a bit of a gypsy, anyway. I spent five years at Oklahoma State, five years at Miami and moved on after winning the national championship, and five years with the Cowboys. So, I was ready to move on. We won back-to-back Super Bowls, and I felt that I accomplished what I wanted to accomplish.
- I'm not a bad man.
- I've seen every second of 'Survivor' since it started.
- The difference between ordinary and extraordinary is that little extra.
- Military leaders aren't made. They are born. To be a good leader, you have to have something in your character to cause people to follow you.
- The other thing was that when I was at the University of Miami, we ran a pro-style offense and defense. I started each year by going to a pro training camp, I visited with various pro coaches, and I did this for five years.
- How 'bout them Cowboys!?
- I want to do what I want to do, when I want to do it.
- A lot of coaches could ration out their time. They could delegate. They would make time for their family. But when I was coaching I would almost laugh at those guys. I knew we were working the extra hours to get an edge on them.
- You can't really compare teams just because of two or three players.
