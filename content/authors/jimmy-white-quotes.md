- Most gamblers do it for ego. It's not about winning or losing, it's about challenging your ego and showing your mates you're fearless and will bet on anything.

- Snooker lifted me out of depression.
- Within a day of wearing the insoles, my feet felt more comfortable, and a week later I was able to go for walks, play golf, and play football with my son, which I hadn't for years.

- I have always loved playing snooker.
- In the past I'd lose and not talk for a few days. I'd become strange. Difficult to live with.

- Snooker is not like boxing or football - you can go on longer.
- That period in the late Eighties and early Nineties was when I was playing my best snooker. My trouble was that I had so many bad habits that my preparation was terrible: people like Steve Davis or Dennis Taylor were model pros.

- I did abuse the game a bit because I didn't give it the respect sometimes.
