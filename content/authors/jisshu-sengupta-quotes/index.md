- When I read a script I respond to it like an audience member. At the end of the film, if I'm there in the audience's mind, I have done my job.
- I am an actor and I do not have to relate to whatever I play on screen them at a personal level. What is important is to understand the character, do enough homework to know the frame of mind of the character or his back story.
- Both my daughters scold me. I am the youngest in my family.
- Since I surrender myself to the director, it is important for me to trust him.
- I am looking at characters that will stay with people, that they will remember. Characters that are relevant.
- I just focus on my character and how pivotal it is to the narrative. I don't mind even a 10-minute role, if it's important to the script.
- I am the only guy in Tollywood who can carry off floral pants and look good.
- I was simultaneously shooting for 'Manikarnika' and 'Ek Je Chhilo Raja'. In two-and-a-half months, I took 23 flights, including an international flight to Los Angeles. It was physically very challenging, shooting for both. I would catch up on sleep on the flights.
- I always want to be surrounded by likeminded people. I cannot work with grumpy people.
- I believe in things which I can see or feel. If I see it, I'll believe in it.
- In Bombay people know me as a Rituparno Ghosh actor but Calcutta gives me the comfort zone and that's why I love shooting here. In Bombay, the money is bigger, the stakes are bigger.
- I did a 10-minute role in Rajkahini, in Manikarnika and a Telugu film too. I hope those left an impact on the audience.
- The top Bengali directors in Bollywood know about me and the work that I have done. I have worked with everyone, from Anurag Basu, Pradeep Sarkar to Shoojit Sircar.
- As an actor I can't think of what my daughter will think when she grows up. I will never do certain kinds of roles that I have in my mind. And for that I'm sure my daughters are going to be proud of me.
- As a creative person, I think one should follow one's heart.
- After reading the script I ask the director about my character's background, what does he do, how he walks, talks, what clothes he wears... I ask the director how he is looking at it.
- I have a problem with the star tag itself. I believe I am an actor.
- I am a director's actor. I love the environment of the set, I want to be there and I try to understand what or how the character would respond to certain situations.
- All I care about is that the audience should remember me for the character I play. I want to be part of content-driven films in any language.
- I am 100-films old. In my heyday, I have done a lot of commercial films, including dancing around the trees with the heroine. But after working with Rituparno Ghosh, my understanding of cinema changed. Whatever good I am doing, it is because of him. If I am being called a good actor, it is only because of him.
- I live every character between 'action' and 'cut' and do not take them home or live with them for 70 days while shooting. That is my process.
- Look, for every film I change my look.
- I had learnt horse riding while shooting for a Bengali film earlier and was trained in sword fighting on the set of 'Manikarnika'.
- Besides, I never think negative. That is my biggest strength. Even if someone thinks bad about me I wish good for that person. I am not saying I am a super human being but I have always wanted good for people and look where I am today!
- My work in Bollywood depends on the dates needed from me and my role in a film.
- I do more of ensemble casting, roles that are different. In one film I'm playing a villain, in the other I'm playing a son.
- It's the upbringing at home. You can have education abroad, the best of things, but you can be a horrible human being.
- I was at a dinner with my family in 2017, end-October, when I got the call. I got to know that 'Manikarnika' was being made and they wanted me to play Gangadhar Rao.
