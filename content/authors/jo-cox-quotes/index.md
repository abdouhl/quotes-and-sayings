- Batley and Spen has a high proportion of people working in manufacturing, and we can boast the full range of industries, including high-skilled, precision engineering. We manufacture all sorts, from beds to biscuits and from carpets to lathes. We also have some of the best fish and chips in the country and some of the best curries in the world.
- I live on a big old Dutch barge by Tower Hill on the Thames.
- Indeed, by refusing to tackle Assad's brutality, we may actively alienate more of the Sunni population, driving them towards ISIS.
- I never really grew up being political or Labour. It was just a realisation that where you were born mattered. That how you spoke mattered... who you knew mattered.
- Yorkshire folk are not fools: talk about devolving power to cities and regions, while simultaneously stripping them of the resources to deliver and subjecting northern councils such as Kirklees to the harshest of cuts, is not compatible with a worthy commitment to building a northern powerhouse to drive growth and prosperity.
- My family didn't really have newspapers at home or talk about politics - my family are not political. They were too busy getting on with it - working, looking after kids, trying to pay off the mortgage, all that stuff.
- Batley and Spen is a gathering of typically independent, no-nonsense and proud Yorkshire towns and villages.
- It is time to give city and county regions the powers and resources they need to promote growth, and I will happily work with all of those who are genuinely committed to building an economic powerhouse in the north.
- I spent the summers packing toothpaste at a factory, working where my dad worked, and everyone else had gone on a gap year!

- Immigration is a legitimate concern, but it's not a good reason to leave the E.U.
- I fancy myself as a bit of a groover.
- Our communities have been deeply enhanced by immigration, be it of Irish Catholics across the constituency or of Muslims from Gujarat in India or from Pakistan, principally from Kashmir.
- I was an aid worker for a decade and then worked in the voluntary sector in the U.K. on U.K. child poverty and with the NSPCC and Save the Children. But I had worked for ten years with Oxfam.
- We cannot allow voters to fall for the spin that a vote to leave is the only way to deal with concerns about immigration. We can do far more to address both the level and impact of immigration while remaining in the E.U.
- Who can blame desperate parents for wanting to escape the horror that their families are experiencing?
- Many businesses in Yorkshire want the security and stability of Britain's continued membership of the European Union, a cause I look forward to championing passionately in this place and elsewhere.
- Da'esh and Assad are not separate problems.
- I've lived and worked in Brussels and New York at the U.N. and worked all over the world. I would jump on a plane and be in Kabul one week and then Dafur the next.
- My summer jobs for three years were going to work in my dad's factory and earn a bit of pocket money. I absolutely loved it, and I think I learnt more there than I did at Cambridge, actually, in terms of how hard work is and how tough it is finding a job, keeping a job, managing a job and family and commitments outside of work.

- I am Batley and Spen born and bred, and I could not be prouder of that. I am proud that I was made in Yorkshire, and I am proud of the things we make in Yorkshire. Britain should be proud of that, too.
- When the bombs rain down, the Syrian Civil Defense rush in.
- Businesses in my constituency want help to address the skills mismatch at local level which leaves employers with staff shortages and young people without jobs. They want access to reliable sources of finance, including a network of local banks.
- The spirit of non-conformity is as prevalent now in my part of west Yorkshire as it was in the time of my two immediate predecessors, Mike Wood and Elizabeth Peacock.
- Brexit doesn't guarantee that migration will come down.
- In my view, it is only when civilians are protected that we will defeat ISIS, and until that is at the centre of our plan, I will remain an outspoken advocate for that cause.
- It is simply not credible to tackle child poverty without acknowledging the worst issue - a lack of money.
- I went to Cambridge University and was the first in my family to graduate.
