- We need to confront our real problems, not indulge in false solutions that make them worse.
- You really don't throw a ministerial job away lightly.
- The pattern shows that whenever countries try to construct access to the single market... it has required freedom of movement and massive contributions to the E.U. budget, and no role in any decision making processes that frame the rules.
- It's been an honour to represent Orpington for 9 years & to serve as a minister under three PMs.
- What is so clearly in the national interest is everything the government is doing in its strong, one nation domestic policy agenda: more police on the streets, more doctors and nurses in our hospitals, a welcoming face to scientists and international students.
- I want to make it very-very clear that Indian students are warmly welcome to U.K.
- No one voted for a Brexit that will tie us to the E.U.'s customs rules and prevent us striking meaningful trade deals of our own.
- While we have agreed to pay the E.U. tens of billions of pounds in the Withdrawal Agreement, the Political Declaration that aimed to set out the principles for this future negotiation is a document deliberately vague to allow it to mean all things to all people.
- Brexit has divided the country. It has divided political parties. And it has divided families too.
- The day after Britain voted to leave the European Union, I woke up determined to make a success of Brexit. I was surprised by how quickly I went to acceptance of the result, without passing through any of the prior stages of grief.
- As the U.K.'s position as a global financial services hub weakens, our competitors will lose no time in attracting jobs in services from our shores.
- A vote to leave would be a leap into the dark that would put our status as a science superpower at risk. That is why I will be joining Boris in making a positive case for Britain's future in a reformed E.U.
- I grew up in Brussels.
- If we are serious about Global Britain, we must recognise that international students bring huge benefits to our universities, our local economies and our soft power.
- We are leaving the E.U. But we have no idea where we are going.
- I challenge the Government to come clean on the cost of Brexit. The reason they can't look us in the eye, it's because they know this will leave us worse off and with less control. It's a gross abuse of civil service impartiality.
- Certainly, I know from my own work at the Department of Transport the potential chaos that will follow a 'no deal' Brexit. It will cause disruption, delay and deep damage to our economy.
- Some Brexiteers are passionate defenders of the benefits of immigration. Others just can't wait to slam the doors shut.
- It is of course true that many of our universities are large and complex organisations, requiring highly skilled individuals to run them effectively.
- The Government has boxed itself in by trying to codge together this weird fake Brexit in the hope of committing people to somehow delivering on the referendum result.
- Brexit was meant to be about taking back control, we are ceding control; it was meant to be about trade deals, we are not going to have any meaningful trade deals; it was meant to be about having a turbo-charged tiger economy on the edge of Europe, we are going to be bound by the common rule book that we won't have a hand in shaping.
- The case for Brexit was made on rhetorical flourishes and promises and bluster. A lot of promises on which people voted have turned out to be undeliverable. It was a false prospectus.
- There is no better system in the world than the U.K. education system that offers better value for money.
- Although I voted Remain, I have desperately wanted the Government, in which I have been proud to serve, to make a success of Brexit: to reunite our country, our party and, yes, my family too.
- I have spent more time thinking about European issues than even I can imagine - so many years thinking about Britain and the way our influence around the world was amplified through the European Union.
- As the Bank of England has noted, Brexit is a unique experiment in the reimposition of protectionist barriers to trade.
- Leadership involves building an esprit de corps, the creation of a sense of purpose in pursuit of noble and clear objectives.

- There is no precedent of an advanced economy withdrawing from a trade agreement as deep and as complex as the European Union.
- Free movement of people makes it easier for our universities to attract the best talent.
- Suspension of disbelief is a necessary ingredient in all storytelling. So it has been with the government's narrative that it is delivering Brexit.
- I have a wonderful family. My father is a brilliant father, and my mother a brilliant person who had mental-health issues, but has been wonderfully creative throughout her life. They couldn't have been more supportive.
- We talk, as any brothers, or as most brothers do, particularly when you are involved in politics.
- When the U.K. and India collaborate, there is force multiplier, which is very-very strong. The force multiplier with India is much stronger than with many other countries. We get much greater impact and valued research papers when British and Indian scientists co-operate.
- Given that the reality of Brexit has turned out to be so far from what was once promised, the democratic thing to do is to give the public the final say.
