- I feel the need of attaining the maximum of intensity with the minimum of means. It is this which has led me to give my painting a character of even greater bareness.
- For me an object is something living. This cigarette or this box of matches contains a secret life much more intense than that of certain human beings.
- I try to apply colors like words that shape poems, like notes that shape music.
- The works must be conceived with fire in the soul but executed with clinical coolness.
- Throughout the time in which I am working on a canvas I can feel how I am beginning to love it, with that love which is born of slow comprehension.
- What I am looking for... is an immobile movement, something which would be the equivalent of what is called the eloquence of silence, or what St. John of the Cross, I think it was, described with the term 'mute music'.
