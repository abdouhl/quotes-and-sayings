- I like dramas. I've always liked dramas. And I'm a pretty light person. I don't consider myself a very dramatic person. But I do like doing that onscreen.

- I didn't have any ambition to produce big mainstream popcorn movies.
- I do almost all my movies in French. I dub them.
- I think every movie changes me and is life changing, especially movies you direct.
- Everybody reads for me. I was never weird about that. I never minded coming in and reading. They should know if I'm the right person, and I should know if I want to do a movie.

- I don't like the outside world to intrude when I'm making a film. I like to either see my family or work, but I don't like to go out.
- If I make two movies my entire life, and they're two movies that - whether they make a lot of money or two people go to see them - they speak of me, then I consider them incredibly successful. I don't need to be Steven Spielberg.
- Every movie changes you. The process of making a film changes you.
- I've always had this idea that I wanted movies to make people better not worse.
- I am the luckiest filmmaker I know.

- My mom was always late. It drove me crazy as a child. So I'm always on time - or early.
- I love the way L A. leaves you alone. I can go home, read all day, and nobody bugs me.

- I just want to make movies. I really love movies. I want to be involved with them.
- I'm kind of a chatterbox and I talk really fast.
- I'm really not a clothes person. To me, that's just work. It's the thing I hate to do the most. I don't want to be judged in that way.

- I spent a lot of time not in school, so I didn't have deep relationships with kids my own age.

- I don't direct so that I can have an identity and so I can go on to CGI movies. I had a big identity as an actor, and that's not what I'm looking for from directing. Directing is a whole different goal.
- Any actor working a long time should know how a shot is set up, where to place themselves, how to handle the lines. I'm a member of the crew, like the best boy, the electrician. What I'm good at is making eyes at the camera.
- I make dark dramas, movies about people living in desperate fear who then overcome that fear and find a heroic side to themselves.
- With 'Taxi Driver,' I had this eureka moment. I realized that acting could be much more than what I had been doing. I had to build a character that wasn't me.

- Cruelty might be very human, and it might be cultural, but it's not acceptable.

- I think 'destiny' is just a fancy word for a psychological pattern.
- The movies I made when I was 14 or 15, I have a hard time looking at those. Those were the awkward years. I don't know if anybody can look at something they did when they were 14 and not wince.
- Most actors don't really have a director's sensibility. They have an actor's sensibility.
- I feel at various times in my life that I've been at a point where I had to choose between a death sentence and a life sentence. And I want to live. What do I do to live? What do I do to be vital? And the answer is always creativity. The answer is always art.

- I never know what's going to move me. I'm always surprised. And it's always a mystery to the people who work with me.
- I'm a technician. I don't go for the get-into-the-role stuff. I read the lines and play the scenes.
- I'd always need a creative outlet. But sometimes, I do fantasize what my life would be like if I weren't famous.
- I don't see anyone walking around with a puppet on his hand in real life. Puppet therapy is very common for children. It's not something that adults take on.

- In a weird way, that's the beauty of being an actor. You get to live out things that you're afraid of, and you get to say, 'Well, maybe I can get to the end of it and survive it intact and I can be the hero of my own story.' It's kind of a way of exorcising fear.
- As I've said before, and I still hold to, I truly am the most boring person alive. And if there was a great investigation to be found at the end of the resume, it would be, the most boring person alive.
- I wish that I spoke more languages. I speak a couple languages, but not well enough to really dub myself. French is really the only one, and it's a difficult thing.
- I think anybody over 30 plays parents because it happens in your thirties and so that's kind of a natural progression. But I'm definitely drawn to it. It's probably the most intense, passionate thing that happens to you as you get older.
- I was one of those avid moviegoers as a kid, and we didn't have video, so we went to see everything five times. I went to see every foreign film playing in my town. As times went on, I watched a lot less films. I have a different film school now. My film school now is my life experience.

- Being understood is not the most essential thing in life.
- Acting, for me, is exhausting. I'm always more energized by directing. It's more intense to direct. I can pop in and express myself, then pop out again. It's a huge passion for me.
