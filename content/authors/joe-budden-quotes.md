- I couldn't tell you what the standing is in radio, I'm in the streaming world. I'm in the podcasting world. Radio just sounds archaic almost. It's a never-ending battle. I'm so glad I'm retired so I don't have to see the nonsense.
- My relationship with my first child was nonexistent. I was broke and I was a new rapper whose career was spiraling downward.
- I've never been platinum. I've never sold out an arena. I've never been on an arena tour.
- In my brain, it's simple: On the podcast, we're really never serious about anything, ever.
- I'm trying my best to keep things exactly the same. Spotify hasn't changed my process other than doubling up. We do twice a week now.
- For me, honest critique is not all about your feelings and your ear. Honest critique is sitting down with an album that you may not put on in your spare time, and really digging into that album, so you can talk about the beat selection.
- Actually, after 'All Love Lost' I was so drained creatively that I didn't have any clue where I wanted to go. So I just started from scratch.
- People put mixtapes out every few months, every year. They come often. Not 'Mood Muzik.' It's a totally different type of monster. And when you hear it, you should be able to understand why.
- At Revolt, everyone's always open minded and always coming together for a solution.
- I have a few theories and trains of thought that I wouldn't expose because they are not anyone's business. I hold them sacred, it's how I feel, it's my opinion, not up for debate, and not meant to be shared.
- You'll never get me to speak religion. You'll never get me to speak politics.
- My mom's mission my entire teenage years was just to save my life.
- While I understand the Howard Stern comparisons to help contextualize my craft for other people, and while I relate to the moral stance he took against a bigger corporate machine, that's probably where our similarities stop.
- Early on, it was real tough for me to stick to my guns and say 'I'm retired, I'm not rapping, don't ask me for nothing.' But I had to do that because I love rapping and I love music, so if I don't do that, you can't be halfway in it and halfway out.
- State of the Culture' is more mature content. We want to go as deep as we can on whatever the subject matter is, we're not there to joke.
- I always viewed myself as kind of hip-hop's outcast, or hip-hop's stepson.
- For so long, we had to write to pay a bill, we had to write in many instances where maybe you weren't even inspired to write because it was your job. That's how passion, creativity, and love gets killed.
- Remember the Titans' is one of my favorites, not so much because of the actual record, but because there's so many different backstories.
- I've always been outspoken. I've always been honest. I've always said things that maybe other people were afraid to say.
- I will alway support anybody being vocal about their mental illness, how they're dealing with it, and how it affects them. And I'll always support people waking up and paying attention to that.
- I'm such a spiritual man. I think that displayed in the music throughout the course of my career.
- You have to remember, throughout my career, no one has ever really wanted to speak to me or wanted to sit down with me.
- I think that's why most people listen to me - it is relatable. Who doesn't have a drama-filled story with an ex? We all do.
- That's the part I kept trying to say on Queen Radio: I don't have to believe you because you're saying it. I'm not saying you're a liar, I learned that long ago too. There's a big difference between you're a liar and I don't believe you.
- I want to get us out of a place where the veterans are chastising the new artists and vice versa. I think we should all just support each other.
- You put your blood, sweat, and tears into an album and you think that's where it ends, but no - when you go on tour you're still carrying the life of that album and the life of those songs until you put your next project out.
- Music is my therapy.
- I was just rapping as a pastime and I became good at it. So much so that by the time my Def Jam contract was in front of me, I didn't have a rap name.
- There's no one aspect of my life that is more hidden than others. I mean, everything is pretty much an open book in every regard: relationships, personal, business, music, family, problems, demons, everything is well documented.
- Yeah, well I've had a record deal for a long time so I'm kinda used to the cameras and the people, I'm used to dealing with peoples' opinions.
- I may catch some flack for this, but the Jersey style I feel is just very different from New York. When I hear a Jersey MC spit, I can just hear New Jersey in them. To where as NY, that style has been broadcasted so nationally that it's just a natural sound in music.
- Even in this podcast media lane, sometimes you still have to wear your MC hat and let people know how you feel about yourself as an MC, which is very confident.
- I'm the first person to shamelessly admit that I don't know it all. With that said, my attitude is if such that if I don't know something I want you to enlighten and inform me so we can grown and get somewhere together - even if that means we ultimately agree to disagree.
- Before I judge someone, I need to talk to them and learn what their journey's are.
