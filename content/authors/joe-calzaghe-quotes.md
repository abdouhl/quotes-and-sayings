- You think that after becoming world champion, you're going to be a massive superstar with lots of lucrative bouts against great fighters, but that never materialised for me.
- When I was about 12, I realised I wasn't going to make it as a top footballer, but I won my first British ABA title at 13. From then on, I wanted to be a world champion.
- There'll never be another Muhammad Ali. He was a superstar. And although he has gone, his legacy will live on for what he has done for sport and humanity.
- I'm a regular guy, got the same friends. I live in the same area of south Wales. That's who I am. I'm just a normal guy. I just fight.
- There comes a time in any proud sportsman's career when you have to make the difficult decision to stop.
- Roy Jones is a difficult fight.
- Boxing's a very lonely sport. That ring is the loneliest place in the world.
- My career has been very difficult. People respect the fact that I haven't just turned professional like Amir Khan or Audley Harrison, and it's been, 'Here's a million pound' - for spoilt brats to fight a couple of fights.
- In America, they slag each other off at the press conference, then get in the ring and don't do anything.
- To win the four major title belts, to be the unbeaten champion and 10 years a champion - it's amazing. I'm so proud.
- If you know you're just fighting for the money and you're not fighting for the championship, you're going to lose, so I thought, 'It's time for me to quit.'
- There is a world of difference between being a reality TV star and a world champion boxer.
- The perfect fighter has never been born and never will be.

- Enzo, my dad, supports Juventus, so that's my team and, obviously, Italy, who I've been fortunate enough to see win two World Cups.
- I try to work out about four or five times a week. I'll do a little bit of cardio, half hour on the punchbag, or just go for a jog.
- Before the Roy Jones fight, I knew I was going to retire because I couldn't train, my hands had gone, and the hunger had gone.
- It's not just a trainer - as a man, my dad was unbelievable. Even outside boxing, he was my friend as well. We were boxer and trainer in the gym, but as soon as that bell goes, we'd have a cup of tea, and we'd go on about normal life. We would just leave that bit behind. That's how we kept going.
- When I go into the ring, I don't hate opponents, and I certainly don't want to hurt them.
- It's unbelievable when I think back to when I was a kid that one day I would have achieved so much through boxing, and to think my teachers laughed at me when I said I was going to be a boxer.
- I believe amateur boxing training should be available in schools. Not for all, but for those who want to.
- I've never wanted fame. I've only ever wanted recognition.
- I agreed to be on 'Strictly Come Dancing' without watching the show. I got talked into it by my manager. And my God, I was crap at it.
- It's in my DNA to fight and entertain.
- Boxing's in my blood, so I'll always stay involved in that, and I'll probably do a bit of TV work as well, commentary and that.
- I can't understand it myself - how nervous I was when I took the floor for 'Strictly Come Dancing.' I walk out with 50,000 people gathered in the Millennium Stadium to fight Mikkel Kessler in the unification fight for the super middleweight division in 2007, and I feel great... and here I am, wearing tight pants and Cuban heels, and freaking out.
- Why am I not a household name in Britain? Why have I not got the recognition I deserve after so long? I think the fact that none of my fights are seen on terrestrial television is significant but, other than that, I don't exactly know. I really don't.
- Beating Chris Eubank in 1997 was a great win and the toughest fight of my life, and beating Jeff Lacy was great, too. But Mikkel Kessler topped it, winning all the belts and fighting in front of all those fans in my home town.
- We're only human, and fear can eat away at you the closer you get to a big fight.
- Promoting is a no-no - that's hard work. Training is a full-time job, but I don't have time to do that full-time. But managing is something I'll be good at.
- On a personal level, I probably wouldn't want my boys to box professionally. But I do encourage them to get into boxing training - they both go along. It keeps them fit.
- I embraced every struggle because it made me the fighter I was.
- At the end of your career, you go, 'I'm gonna be able to retire undefeated and be one of the very, very few people in history to do it.' People were saying I should try and get to 50-0, but my number was 46 - that was it. I could have kept trying, but one loss would have spoiled everything.
- My natural weight is 13 st. 7 lb. That's what I walk around at.

- I want to prove that I'm not just the best super middleweight in the world but the best pound-for-pound.
- I'm actually thinking about acting lessons. If somebody says to me, 'You can be in the movies,' I'd be pretty happy.
- I do like to travel.
- I'm somebody from a little tiny town, who had boxed in leisure centres, and my last fight was in Madison Square Garden against one of the greats. What a great way to finish off.
- When I was 14, I told my careers adviser that I was going to be a world champion boxer. Of course she laughed.
- I don't really watch much boxing.
- There's no point looking good and losing. Winning is what it's all about, and you can't always look spectacular while doing it.
- I think we have a normal father-and-son relationship. But like any other relationship, we have our differences. But we always seem to work out our differences. Believe it or not, our personalities are similar. We're both fiery and passionate.
- I was told as a teenager I'd never box again. I had a really bad wrist injury; I couldn't even shadow box for six months. I went through surgery just to try and manage it.
- You can never say never in this game, but I can't see myself boxing again. There's loads of things I want to do.
- Boxing was my destiny.
- I definitely was a big puncher early on in my career, and I used to load up with my left hand. Then, towards the end of my career, I had hand problems and needed injections in my hands for the pain.
- Ideally, it would be nice if you could earn enough money to kick on from boxing and use the finances to start a business. Realistically, that doesn't happen.
- It used to hurt me when people said I was hiding in Wales.
- I find it quite sad to see the likes of Evander Holyfield carrying on past their sell-by date.
- I've been through the routine so many times that I genuinely don't even think about a big fight very much beforehand.
- It would be good to fight Roy Jones. I've always admired him, and I think this would be a great fight for the fans.
- My father was a cocky, long-haired musician, a songwriter.
- After a weigh-in, you drink and put on the pounds. But it's just fluid, not muscle, so you get in the ring and feel flat.
- At 14, 15, everyone at school stopped talking to me, and I went completely into my shell. Basically, I'd be hiding. I had no friends. I hated it.
- I'm pretty excited: to be inducted into the Hall of Fame is a massive achievement... and to be inducted with Oscar de la Hoya and Felix Trinidad, two great fighters, is a massive honour for me and my family.
- My dad is a great judge of fights. He's the only person I know who said that Holyfield would beat Tyson the first time.
- Boxing definitely has a part to play in taking away unwanted aggression.
- I like to give my kids the life I didn't have - they go to an excellent school; they have nice clothes, money for shopping. I'm quite generous with them, but they have fantastic manners - they're not spoilt.
- I'm a boxer, and every fight could be my last. You just have to remember Michael Watson to know what boxing can do to you.
- When it comes to the singing part, I think I missed the boat - the whole family can sing except for me. But they can't fight, so I suppose I've been a bit more successful than them there.
- I've beaten all contenders for 11 years. I'm not a robot; I'm fed up. My body's tired of it. I'm 36.
- Fighters never realise when it is time to walk away. They can't leave the buzz and adoration that surrounds being champion.
- Having been a fighter for 25 years, I know how to handle the fear. The fear is there, but I use it to motivate me.
- I'm a Juventus fan, although I did support Chelsea for some time - mainly because of Gianfranco Zola. Zola is from the same town as my father Enzo, in Sardinia.
- When I boxed against Jeff Lacy, that was one fight that I was so proud of.
- I've fought in Copenhagen before, and it's not the most hostile place in the world.
- My first boxing memory is watching Marvin Hagler and Sugar Ray Leonard on television.
- I don't seek the limelight. I'm perfectly happy with a quiet life and spending time with my family, but I deserve recognition.
- I'm not going to lie: you do get down sometimes, but I wouldn't say I was ever depressed; that's too hard a word. But you do become bored, because all you've done in your life is fight and box.
- I never really, really pushed my boys into boxing, but I guess it's in the blood.
- I was born in London but brought up in Wales from the age of two.
- I'm proud to be one of only a few fighters in history to retire undefeated.
- If I'm greedy and keep chasing the money, it's inevitable I will be beaten one day.
- My mum is the opposite of my dad. She's a very private person, very shy and totally against boxing. She never watched any of my fights live. She hated me doing it.
- From 13 years old, I was treated like a professional.
- I like him as a guy, but I'm going to knock him out - Roy Jones is just a prop in a fairytale ending to a great career for me.
- The world title in a second weight division and a win in America is just the icing on the cake of my career.
- I swore to myself that I was never going to lose again, and that's what drives me still. More than money, more than titles, more than fame, it's the desire not to be defeated.
- I liked 'The Office' when it was on.
- Being retired is one thing, but staying retired is another. Even when I announced my retirement, I'm sure people thought I was going to come back.
- You have to try things in life.
- Test match cricket - it's the most boring thing to watch. How they call themselves sportsmen I'll never know.
- Amateur boxing is one of the safest sports around.
- I didn't like school at all. I was bullied and didn't have a good time. Boxing was my escapism, and the ring was where I felt best.
- When you've been at the top of the sport for so many years, it's your life, and it becomes very difficult just to quit boxing and find something else to be happy.
- I am not an aggressive person. I am a disciplined, chilled, and relaxed guy.
- I'm close to achieving something that very few boxers ever have - and that is to retire undefeated, like Rocky Marciano.
- It's one of the biggest disappointments of my boxing career, not going to the Olympics.
- Every fighter, when they box, wants to leave a mark in their sport, or a legacy, and I managed to do that beyond my wildest dreams.
- Spiders - hate 'em.
- I appreciate what I've achieved, and nearly all of that is because of my dad. He pushed me to train harder than I would have done if he wasn't there to discipline me.
- We had nothing, no money, when I was young. We lived in a council house. My dad struggled; my mum struggled. But that made me what I am. If I had everything on a plate from the start, maybe I would not have been a champion for 11 years.
- You ask all the super-middleweights: Who is the best fighter in Britain? If I came back, it would be me.
- There were times people tried to get me to change trainers, but I stuck with my dad.
- I prayed before fights. Especially just before I got in to the ring. But I'd also have my iPod on, Prodigy and Linkin Park ripping through my ears.
