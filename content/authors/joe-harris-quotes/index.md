- You get a lot of accommodations for being on scholarship, but there is too much money floating around in the NCAA to not be giving it to the people earning it.
- Every step of way, going from a small town to Charlottesville and playing in the ACC - that whole experience is a difficult adjustment. In all of that, you really grow as a person and as a basketball player.
- Whenever you play with better competition or play against better players, it raises your level of play on both ends of the court.
- I know what my game is and what I do well and I'm just going to keep trying to I,prove and make sure I'm consistent as possible in those areas.
- Everybody's always asking me: 'What's it like playing with LeBron?' It's really hard to describe. I'm pretty fortunate that I got him my first year. He's an awesome guy, a great leader. You're witnessing such greatness all the time and you try not to take it for granted because you see it so often, in practice or wherever.
- There have been lots of times in my career where you go four or five games and feel like you can't hit anything. And you also have the exact opposite.
- Obviously, you hope to make shots. But you can't put too much pressure on yourself to make it, because whether or not they go in, you're creating space everybody else.
- I was fortunate in college to play as a freshman, but in the NBA, not a lot of rookies are coming in and making a significant impact right off the bat.
- I mean, I don't hate attention. I don't embrace it or like it a whole lot.
- There's a tendency, guys get really excited and go through practice, and they want to stay for an extra hour after and do these workouts. What you should be doing is getting in the cold tub or getting your corrective exercises in with your strength coach, little things like that which can help you in the long run.
- I think going to Virginia and playing in that program, you definitely take a lot of ownership in the fact of possessions and understanding the value of each possession. And that goes on both ends. Trying to be as efficient as possible on the offensive end, and not turn the ball over. But then defensively, making everything tough.
- It was really important for me to get a degree that carried some weight, something that I really wanted to do.
- Obviously playing on a team like the Cavs in 2014, they were championship contenders, not allowing a ton of young guys to come in and play through mistakes. If you weren't helping the team have success you weren't really afforded a lot of different opportunities.
- Obviously my role is shooter, trying to take my numbers to another level from that perspective.
- To actually play a game, where you are in the World Cup, there is significance to it, the point differential matters, all these things kind of add up.
- I miss UVA and Charlottesville a lot but not so much of going to class.
- I keep in touch with all the guys that I was training with in Chicago during the pre-draft process; Nik Stauskas, Mitch McGary, Adrien Payne, and Dougie McDermott. We all got pretty close training together and we just keep tabs every now and then.
- I loved going to a place like Virginia, making a connection and meeting the people that are outside of the whole basketball realm, and earning my degree from there.
- I hear that a lot... shoot more.
- You don't really coach high school basketball because it's a good paycheck. You do it because you love it, care about the kids and you're just passionate about the game.
- Every time you play against somebody like Giannis, you have to be really locked into the game plan.
- You've got to be able to guard hard and then work yourself offensively to get shots.
- My parents have always told me it's better to write your goals out because then you can look at them every day. You're constantly reminded.
- Some nights, depending on who you're going up against, some guys are just capable of hitting tough shots.
- I play around 220.
- In college you might think you travel a lot, but it is nowhere close to the NBA.
- Kyrie is a good guy. Spent a lot of time with him over the years because we were the same class in high school and ACC when he was at Duke. Then I was with him my rookie year in Cleveland.
- Steph is the greatest shooter of all time. Shooting off the rack is not indicative of being a better shooter than Steph Curry.
- There's not a lot of guys in the NBA who stick with one team for very long.
- I feel like I play with good poise and I know when to take my shot - and when I do, I have a lot of confidence.
- I don't really get recognized a whole lot. I blend in pretty well.
- There aren't a lot of second chances for second-round picks.
- Obviously, back-to-backs are tough... but everyone goes through it in this league.

- If you've got one guy that can create just a little bit of space for somebody that can get downhill, it opens up everything offensively.
- I think Brooklyn is easily one of the best NBA cities out there.
- The decision of where I wanted to go to school was very important to me.
- You don't look through the NBA schedule and say, 'this is going to be an easy night.'
- There's teams that have a lot of success in the back-to-back, and I think those teams just have a strong mental fortitude.
- I think I've gotten more comfortable and more confident on the defensive end. I've just been able to anticipate things a little bit better instead of reacting to how guys play offensively.
- I was lucky in my rookie year to play in the NBA Finals, to have that experience, to see what it was like to get to that stage.
- I've kind of given up trying to evaluate college guys, especially guys from Virginia, just because of my bias.
- I just love basketball.
- A lot of Washington state is beautiful. You have just tons of mountains, beautiful bodies of water, you have a lot of rolling hills in eastern Washington. I'm biased, obviously, but there's not a lot of places in the world that are like where I grew up.
- Even over the course of the NBA's schedule, you're gonna have games where you're gonna take your lumps.
- I think you go across this league and you talk to every coach and every player, and dealing with a young, up-and-coming team is much different than coaching superstar players, and everybody kind of realizes that it's a much different dynamic.
- I've grown up with the same people my whole life. I've had the same classmates from elementary all the way through graduating.
- I kind of look like I work in a Brooklyn coffee shop.
- Obviously any time you play home in front of your own fans, you definitely get a distinct advantage that way.
- Preparation is such a big thing and you should never take that for granted.
- Everybody has a different path to making it in this league. I was fortunate to get an opportunity here in Brooklyn.
- I've been No. 12 my entire career. My cousin Nikki Haerling was a good basketball player, she wore No. 12 in high school and college, and my dad, he was No. 12 as well. I actually just started wearing it when I got to high school my freshman year.
- They have great restaurants, good nightlife. Everything is here in Brooklyn that you can possibly want.
- If someone has my number that I don't know and texts me a considerable amount I would just block the number.
- I was so competitive when I played. I was trying to get every loose ball, trying to get steals. That's what I was kind of infamous for in high school.
- Yeah, I think any time you're comfortable playing within a system you're going to play more aggressive. You're going to play with more confidence.
- Sometimes you've got to be able to finish at the rim.
- Yeah, I had a good relationship with Coach Blatt. I enjoyed playing for him. But the NBA is, first and foremost, a business, and as much as you may have liked the situation you were at, sometimes it just doesn't work out your way.
- The conditioning aspect of things is really important, obviously in basketball, and then specifically for players like me.
- Personally, I already get paid way too much to play a game.
- You never want to see anybody get hurt... but if you've ever played basketball before you've probably sprained your ankle so that stuff happens. It's part of the game.
- I like this book by Angela Duckworth called 'Grit.'
- It's hard to compete with everything that Brooklyn has to offer as a city.
- Cleveland, although I didn't play a lot I really learned a ton in my year and a half of being there. I was really fortunate to be around some of the game's best players.
- Kyrie, he's got a big personality. He's one of these guys that's misunderstood. The way that he's construed in the media is probably going to paint him in a light that is not necessarily true. I'd say you could ask a lot of people that played with him and they'd all say that he's a great teammate and a good guy to be around.
- It was like a brother-sister type relationship with all of my cousins. Growing up we were always hanging out together. We all kind of looked after each other like brothers and sisters when we went to school and stuff.
- I have off days all the time too, but nobody really cares when I have an off day. People care when Kyrie does.
- Coming into my rookie year, I could kind of eat whatever I wanted - you're really not too concerned about it. But you don't realize that a pound here and there is really not a good thing. It's just basic physics: it's harder to move faster and jump higher when you weigh more.
- My grandparents owned an apple orchard when I was growing up - a lot of apples, cherries... now, actually, a lot of grapes, too, to be honest.
- The shots, all that stuff, kind of comes and goes. You're not going to be hitting every single game. You wish that you could. But there's a lot of other areas to impact the game where I focus more on.
- Some games you're gonna have seven shots, some games you're gonna have 15, it just ebbs and flows with the game.
- If I ever got into trouble with my sisters or was slacking off, it was always my punishment that I couldn't go to a practice or a game. That was the worst thing in the world.
- I'm one of the best shooters in the League.
- When you look across the board at the count of NBA quality players that are on various international teams in Europe, Latin America, the Middle East and Asia, there are good players all over the world now. It's just not in the NBA where America has the most talent.
- We're all going to have ups and downs throughout the course of the season.
- You're gonna have pretty bad defeats. But you've gotta be able to respond and come back in and compete the next night.
- Shooting's contagious: Guys start seeing the ball go in and everybody starts to feel good.
- If you stay around in the NBA long enough, you're going to bounce around, your teammates are going to bounce around, but those friendships, they remain constant.
- I come from a town in Washington state that might not be too familiar to Clevelanders called Chelan. It's really beautiful. It's about two-and-a-half hours east of Seattle and two-and-a-half hours west of Spokane. It's right in the middle of the state.
- None of us are perfect all the time.
- Some games you're going to be able to get rolling, you're going to get in a good rhythm, you're going to be able to get open looks. Other games, sometimes the rhythm's not there and you've got to get off it a little bit.
- You can play basketball - if you're lucky - for about 10 years. So, you're going to have to have something to fall back on.
- The way I play - I'm the guy moving, coming off screens, getting up and down the floor. I should be one of the better-conditioned athletes out there.
- Over the course of the game you're probably going to have 10 turnovers or so just because you're playing hard, you're competing, that's the way the game goes. But it's the other 10 that you have to limit. You can't have the careless ones, the ones where guys are cutting backdoor and you throw it, or you try the hail mary pass.
- My hometown, first and foremost, it's one of the most beautiful places I've ever seen. A beautiful lake town. It's one of those communities where, winter rolls around, it's exactly the same as any other small town in America. Sort of a lower socio-economic area. There isn't anything high-end necessarily anywhere around there.
- Some rookies build bad habits and it's not until year three, four, five that they get to be part of a winning-type organization and culture.
- I grew up in the Northwest, so I was always a really big Sonics fan. I loved Gary Payton, Shawn Kemp, a lot of those players who were really good through the '90s.
- I don't think too highly of myself, but at the same time, I don't think too lowly of myself.
- When you're going through a game and you miss your first couple, you definitely put a little bit of added pressure on yourself. And there is that sense of frustration. You got to block it out and realize that the whole goal of what I'm trying to do is just get open shots.
- I grew up in kind of a resort community. I lived on a big lake. It was really cool growing up there. But a lot of people come there in the summertime, especially Seahawks guys.
- I think at the end of the day, regardless of who you're playing against, there's talent on every single team in the NBA.
- I played football growing up so I used to lift quite a bit when I was in high school. And then I got to Virginia I was lucky, good strength and conditioning program and coach there.
- I know I have a lot of areas and room to improve.
- There's only so much you can do as far as individual skill work and conditioning on a bike. But you can't simulate playing in an actual game. And it can't satisfy the competitive itch you feel as a player.
- If you look at all the top shooters in the NBA, guys that might be specialists like how I see myself, they're always 40 percent and above. So, that's a personal goal for me to get into that elite three-point shooting percentage.
- I liked the idea of being one of the foundations for Coach Bennett's program and trying to revive UVa basketball.
- Coach Blatt is very, very knowledgeable about the game. And it just goes to show you that no matter where you're at, he knows as much about basketball as anyone. You learn a lot from him. And he's a very charming guy, very personable. He's pretty funny, too.
- The teams that have got good continuity, good chemistry typically have more success.
- I feel like I take a lot of pride in the patience that I play with.
- The NBA is a difficult thing because the head coaches, they definitely have one of the more difficult jobs and one of the jobs with, I guess, little amount of security as possible. There's so much turnover all the time.
