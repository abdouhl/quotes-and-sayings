- Acting was the only place that I ever felt like I belonged so went for it with everything I had.
- I watched so many comic book movies where the actors weren't as built as the characters in the book. It made me mad because they didn't look right.
- I was happier going back to my roots: training like men do in my hometown of Pittsburgh. Back home the guys in the gyms don't lift to look good; they're lifting to lift. They do it because they want to squat more and bench more.
- American comedies especially are all about these men being browbeaten by their wives and it's impossible for me to watch.
- I had a fan make me a silver wolf-tooth necklace. That was really great.
- When I first got out of drama school, my original manager tried to get me to change my name because people were having trouble spelling it and saying it.
- Well, being 6' 5', pull-ups are my nemesis. I have really long arms so I have to do twice the work of someone with short arms to get the weight up there.
- Well, if I hadn't have been an actor I would have gone on to play college sports.
- I started working at clubs when I was sixteen, which is young. I would not want my kid doing that, but I did, and that's how it went.
- I wouldn't tell anyone to study werewolves - I studied wolves, how they moved, their tendencies and sensibilities.
- Also, to be honest, my dad wanted me to be an athlete. And I think all sons want to prove something to their dad. So now, aged 35, I want to see what I can achieve physically.
- I train like a pro-athlete, not like an actor who's just trying to look pretty.
- I come from classical theater training and when I went to college it was a bunch of kids that were hand-picked from around the world. I was around such brilliant young minds and incredible artists with incredible teachers.
- I was kind of a dark kid. I loved Halloween, and I loved vampires and the black and white old monster movies.
- Acting was my first love.
- I mean 'One Tree Hill' had some rabid fans - you'd be surprised - they're almost in a class of their own.
- I mean, everyone walks into the gym on day one skinny or fat. Arnold Schwarzenegger walked into the gym skinny at 15 or 16, and I was that way, too.
- It's tricky when I'm constantly traveling and adjusting to new time zones and trying to also keep up with my workouts.
- I think you can be athletic and intellectual at the same time.
- I grew up a big comic book reader, as a kid, and I love the whole fanboy crowd.
- I got to L.A. in 2000, when we were coming off the '90s: women looked like men and the men all looked like women.
- Matt Bomer and I went to Carnegie Mellon for drama together.
- I grew up a misfit. I never fit in.
- When I was growing up, it was Clint Eastwood, it was Harrison Ford and Steve McQueen - these guys were tough. They were leading men, but they were also tough and physical.
- When I'm training for 'True Blood,' I don't eat any sugar except for some fruit here and there. So it's no sugar, no bread, no real carbs all day.
- I've always been an athletic guy, but the extent to which I go for 'True Blood' or for 'Magic Mike' is because of the role that I'm playing.
- I wake up at the same time every day to get to the gym.
- I mean, I feel like I've been pretending I was a werewolf since I was a little kid.
