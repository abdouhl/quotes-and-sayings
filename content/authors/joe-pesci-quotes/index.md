- You don't say hello to Mr. DeNiro? Show the respect, will ya?

- Did Mad freakin' Max just call me irritating?
- I'm just some lunatic macaroni mushroom, is that it?
- There are great actors we'll never see just because they haven't had my luck.
- There was a time I couldn't get a job.
- Ah, I don't do interviews, really.
- Scorsese and De Niro taught me to bring out the natural side of myself. And they taught me to think of myself as the average guy. Sometimes the average guy belongs in a role more than your matinee idol-type of person. We have to have people we can relate to.
- I've been married three times, but I'll never forget my first trip as a young man, on my honeymoon, with my new wife.
- I would have done something else in life. Something more calming, in a different area where I did not have to use my emotions.
