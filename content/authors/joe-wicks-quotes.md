- Oh, I love a good burger, I really do. With chips and a beer and ice cream afterwards.
- Unconditional love is so important for people with addiction.
- You can have an awesome physique by doing just 25 minutes exercise a day. That's all I do.
- I'm not a military-style guy. I'm very, like, relatable.
- I'm the man I am today because of what my dad's been through, what my mum's been through and I always had love and that's the most powerful thing you can have in life.
- There's no wrong or right with fitness. It's whatever you enjoy and whatever you can keep up and keep doing.
- One thing I had more than anything, I had love and support from my mum and dad. My mum used to say: 'I don't care if you become a dustman or a doctor, you can be who you want.'
- I think kids learn from what they see.
- That would be the most powerful thing I've ever achieved, if I can take a kid who doesn't like exercise and get them to enjoy it. That would be the ultimate, ultimate achievement for me.

- I'm always giving out such a positive message that I never really get attacked. There's not much you can attack me for.
- My mum is a social worker and my dad's a roofer. My brother Nicky and I were the first two in my family to go to university.

- I don't do politics.
- I eat three home-cooked meals a day, all prepared in advance. My ethos is to stay away from unsustainable low-calorie diets and aim for something balanced: loads of veg, protein and enjoy the carbs you love. Be realistic. I don't count sugar or salt or grams of fat: it's very restrictive and unenjoyable.
- I had quite a chaotic home life, it wasn't stable, my diet wasn't great. I was never an overweight child, but I had behavioural issues. I think that was linked to my upbringing and not having a great start with my nutrition.
- I don't want people to compare themselves to me and feel bad. I want to be inspiring, not to depress them.

- Think of your body like a car: a glass of water first thing in the morning is like starting your engine.
- Your baby is your baby and you are free to feed them however you like. Try not to compare your child to others. This is your journey and you can take it at your own pace. Whichever style of weaning you decide to go for is your choice, and remember: all children eventually do learn to eat with a knife and fork.
- I don't come from a very ambitious family. We weren't entrepreneurial. We weren't hard-working academics, or setting up businesses. But for some reason, when I started doing fitness, I always had this voice in my head telling me to keep going - keep going, and people will eventually follow.

- A lot of people would question, 'is twenty-five minutes or thirty minutes a day really enough to have a good physique?' But that's how I live my life: I do short and intense workouts so that I can enjoy my day and be with my family and not be in the gym for hours.
- I'm not someone who... counts calories or tracks macros; I've never known how many grams of this and that and how many calories I eat.
- The minute you have a little bit of success, you think: 'I can do more and I can reach more people.' So as I've achieved more, I've become way more focused.

- Lots of kids don't have active lives and good diets.
- Don't look too far into the future, just look at tomorrow. One day at a time. Can you win tomorrow? Can you make progress? The answer is yes, you have a choice and tomorrow you're going to win.
- I just don't regret anything I've gone through or anything I have been through with my mum and dad, I'm just proud of who I am.

- Finger foods can help little ones to explore food at their own pace. They are also great for helping them to develop hand-eye coordination and encouraging them to try out a variety of textures.
- It's never too late to get fit; it's never too late to feel good and confident and change the way you eat and train. Just give it a go and momentum will take you the rest of the way.
- I was quite hyperactive as a young kid, and then when I got to high school I was just the class clown. I didn't have much of an attention span.

- If you're really unfit and you want to get into fitness, just starting at home with some really basic, gentle stuff is going to build up your confidence and your fitness. This way, if you do decide to join a gym, you're not going to be really intimidated and just run out the door.
- As a kid I had a very unhealthy diet. I try not to place any blame. Mum was uneducated in cooking. She left school and home at 15, had my older brother when she was 17 and me at 19. It was usually frozen meals and lots of cola, peanut butter, jam sandwiches, sweets and loads of chocolates.
- I've got freakishly large big toes. They look like the ace of spades.

- I think exercise is a huge part of structuring each day.
- You don't need a gym or lots of equipment to get fit and healthy.
- Plan your workouts in advance and try and stick to them like appointments you can't miss.
- I won't do ready meals because I'm teaching people how to cook. I won't do it no matter how much you pay me, you can say you'll give me £100,000 to do it, but my brand is more important than that.
- My top tips for deep sleep are to switch off your laptop and mobile at least 30 minutes before bed and leave them in another room. Ditch the bedroom TV; listen to music instead. Get a comfortable eye mask. It takes getting used to, but trust me, it will allow you to sleep deeper and longer.
- I slag off people I see coming out of the gym with a can of Red Bull or a Lucozade!

- I applied the same mentality to my social media as I did when I was doing my boot camps. I thought, well, no one's watching, but I'll keep adding value, putting out good recipes, funny workouts and good videos. And it grew and grew.
- I've never made a penny from any of the school stuff I've done. I've had brands asking me if they can sponsor my channel for a year, stuff like that. But I've never monetised it. My books and my 90-Day Plan are my business.
- Eat carbs such as sweet potato or jasmine rice within one hour of your workout. Cut down on them on rest days when you don't need the extra fuel.

- Never eat food that drains you of energy; eat food that makes you feel awesome.
- The goal is to get people off low-calorie diets. They're struggling, they're barely eating anything. They need educating.
