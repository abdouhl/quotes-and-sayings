- Now, I'm a failed political consultant. But sometimes fiction has a way of capturing people's imagination in a way that non-fiction doesn't. Conservatives typically haven't written much fiction - specifically political thrillers - over the years to educate, inspire and mobilize people on issues of great import, but we ought to.
- Maybe it's time to go back 2,000 years for a spiritual renaissance. If not, our days may be numbered and a terrible implosion is coming. There is no more middle ground. It is one or the other.
- We are, in many respects, in a moral and spiritual free-fall in our country, and we are paying a terrible price.
- What if these events the Bible says will happen, happens in our lifetime?
- I don't see, based on the evidence, economic and moral, that we can make it that much further.
- Even some of the most jaded D.C. types are still impressed when the leader of the free world enters the room.
- Is there a point at which we hit a tipping point and all of this economic, cultural and moral trouble sends us into a death spiral we can't get out of?
- Many Americans genuinely fear that God is preparing to remove his hand of protection and blessing from our country, or perhaps already has.
- There are people in our world today and unfortunately in our political system, they do not believe in evil. They have the modern, western, secular mind set. They don't believe evil exists. They are exactly the ones who are in danger of getting blindsided by evil. Because they're not prepared for it.
- Prophecy is an intercept from the mind of an all-knowing and all-seeing and all-powerful God.
- God is not a vending machine where if you put in enough prayer quarters we get a Reese's Pieces bag that pops out.
- We are living on the brink of the apocalypse, but the world is asleep.
