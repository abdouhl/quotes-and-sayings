- Beanie and Cecil was the first cartoon I remember watching and I think there are analogies.
- If you notice any of the press from when I was with the show, I would always deny it being the year 3000.
- The name Crow was inspired by a number of things. I thought it would be cool to have a robot with sort of a Native American feel to it.
- The internet is a total inversion of television. It's the opposite.
- So the actual riffing came out of us just sitting there and doing it the way I think some people think we really did it, which is all spontaneously, and it really was.
- Then a friend of Jim's suggested we make a theme song to explain the story, and this is where the Mads came from. Josh and I wrote it into the theme song.
- Mystery Science Theater is really a postmodern show, it's really derived of many influences.
- But after that, I was extremely happy with the story and the look of the show at the beginning of season two - everything was working together. I felt like it was finished conceptually.
- Besides, it doesn't make any sense to have these characters living in the year 3000 when all their points of reference are from the pop culture of the 80's and the 90's.
- Then we tried to come up with ideas for the sketches, and then, when we actually shot the movie, we really just sat down - never previewed the movie - we just really winged it.
- The first twenty shows at TV 23 were really a workshop.
- Well, we had more money and more time the first season than we did at TV 23.
- Well, really the way worked was that I had probably built fifty robots before Mystery Science Theater, and I had sold them in a store in Minneapolis in a store called Props, which was kind of a high end gift shop.
- Gypsy was the name my brother gave a pet turtle he had. I always thought it was so peculiar.
- A lot of the shows that really become hit shows are often demonstrated, like Mystery Science Theater.
- A lot of times when I sit down with the other comics and try to talk theory, they say I'm being too serious.
- South Park started as a little video Christmas card.
- They would hear 3000 and think it was the year 3000, I was hoping it would sort of disorient them and prepare them for the strange message they were about to receive.
- But if you think you aren't creative that's cool, too. I think being around people who aren't creative is kind of refreshing and nice.
- When we did the pilot, I sort of pictured this guy pirating a signal and then this story unfolding of him building this satellite and these robots and watching these bad movies.
