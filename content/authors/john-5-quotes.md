- I find the macabre fascinating; it's all over history.
- I never wished to be a 'rock star.' I just wanted to be a working musician. My dreams didn't even go past a session player or a working musician. It was too far beyond my dreams.

- I, like, prayed inside of my head as a little kid. I didn't grow up in a religious home, but we went to Midnight Mass. That was the only time I'd go to church, but when I did, I prayed that I wanted to be a successful musician. I got my wish.
- I'm always up early. I have so much to do, it's unbelievable how much I have to do in a day. So I have to get at 7 o'clock every morning, and I go to bed at midnight. You know, and I'm just going that whole time.
- I would definitely say Zombie has been the best time I've ever had. It is just so great and so fun because, you know, we all get along so well, and, you know, it's just like, everybody, we're just all friends here, and we're just having a really, really, really great time.
- People don't buy music anymore; they're stealing it. But you can't steal a live show. There's no way to reproduce a real live show. So I think that when you put a great bill together, that people will come out for it.

- I love to learn, and I started doing a lot of studying of Spanish-style music and really started getting into it and how it is just a completely different form of guitar playing.

- I started at such a young age learning every style of music, the country and the bluegrass and the western swing and the rock - everything.
- I wanted to be a guitar player and musician so badly, and I prayed to get this the very few times I went to church, and I feel like I got my prayer answered.
- You know how kids will wait outside after a gig and try to get an autograph from the band? I would do that, but when I found the guitar player, I would say, 'What advice can you give me?' And a lot of my heroes would say, 'Have your own style.' I always kept that in my head.
- A lot of bands, they take a lot of planning to do a live record. They have to hire a crew, and they have to have a recording truck and all this equipment, and they record every single show.
- I love talking to people, and I'll listen to what they have to say, and if they have ideas or something like that, I'll put you to work.
