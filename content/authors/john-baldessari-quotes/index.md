- I could never figure out why photography and art had separate histories. So I decided to explore both.
- When I went to art school, I was just having fun. I realised that was the last chance I had, and then I would have to get a job.
- That word 'funny' always makes me feel uncomfortable. Because if I were trying to be funny, I would be something like Bill Wegman - he really tries to be funny. I don't try to be funny. It's just that I feel the world is a little bit absurd and off-kilter, and I'm sort of reporting.
- It's human desire to be understood. And we always feel we're not understood.
- I go back and forth between wanting to be abundantly simple and maddeningly complex.
- I guess I get bored easily, and thank God. I don't want to all my life pound only the same key, although some artists do it very effectively. I'm not trying to denigrate anybody.
