- Some people feel fulfillment from a bitter end - it gives them some sort of sense of reality. But, when you're dealing with reality, I feel like films should discover the part that is happy.
- Normally you hear about Southeast London, and you hear about all the stuff that goes on down there, all the negative things, and the tabloids kind of stay away from all the positive things that happen that I see every day, which kind of outshines the negative.
- Who wouldn't want to be in 'Star Wars?' It'd be great.
- I know my movies. I love my movies.
- I'm grounded in who I am, and I am a confident black man. A confident, Nigerian, black, chocolate man. I'm proud of my heritage, and no man can take that away from me.
- There is a level of appreciation for brothers and sisters in the hood.

- I'm a comic reader and a manga fan.
- In this life, it's not hard to do wrong.

- I'm a Michael Bay fanatic.
- It's amazing that people still feel, 'Oh my gosh, it's a black guy.' We've been here for a long time; let's get used to it. Let's get used to other cultures.
- My friends and family are not really fixated on the specifics of 'Star Wars.' My parents don't know anything about 'Star Wars.' They've never watched a 'Star Wars' film.
- My stormtrooper suit would chip underneath the armpits and in between the thighs. So they had to do a lot of editing for my costume and shave some areas down.
- I think for me, wearing the helmet and being part of the Stormtroopers felt so strange. Like, so this is what it feels like to just be one of the many. And to look the same, and to have to do the same thing. To be under the same orders. This is what it feels like.
- Being robbed hurts - not physically, but from what it does to your pride.
- Finn doesn't have as much respect for Han's legacy as everybody else does, and Han finds that a bit charming. They team up and go on a mission together. The banter is very choppy, and the dialogue is pretty funny. Chewie enjoys the banter and the friction between the two, but they definitely have each other's backs.
- It's always great to play a character that goes against the grain. Finn defies what people think when they think of stormtroopers.

- My biggest challenge is to not do urban movies for the rest of my life, those alpha hoodies.
- I think 'Star Wars' always has to be bigger and bigger and better every time, and there's a great cast on 'The Force Awakens.' It's ground-breaking.
- People of color and women are increasingly being shown on-screen. For things to be whitewashed just doesn't make sense.
- Despite that it's 'Star Wars' and how huge it is, it's still work to me, and that element of things grounds you, especially from nerding out a few times. Although, some days I can't control myself.
- I've been getting diverse roles.
- I love London. I'm a London fanatic. That's my city.
- Acting careers don't come out fully formed - not unless your name is Jaden Smith and your dad has done it all.

- Like any other actor, my agent called me with an opportunity. It just so happens that the opportunity was the lead in 'Star Wars.'
- I'm having so much fun, because you know what? They cast a Star Wars fan in a Star Wars movie. Biiiiiig mistake!
- I've been acting since I was 5 years old, from primary school to secondary school, did training at drama school, which was the big thing for me because they trained me, put me out into the industry.
- Film is just a great medium to express yourself and a great environment to work around.
- I like my women very green; you know, eco-friendly.
