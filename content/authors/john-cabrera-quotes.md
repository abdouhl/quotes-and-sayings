- Technology has become such a big part of our humanity. We have the Internet on 24 hours a day, even when we're sleeping.
- YouTube is a whole ecosystem.
- There's something to be said about content living on a channel forever.
- I wouldn't say you can engineer viral. But there is viral content that comes from dense communities.
- If YouTube has plenty of premium content, people will watch that in the same way they watch 'Game of Thrones' or 'Breaking Bad.'
- Television and web are merging.
- If you have a YouTube account, you essentially have your own channel, and anybody who subscribes, or any of your friends on YouTube, they're your audience.
- YouTube's audience is very specific. They are ready for great content. But you have to engage with the audience in a very direct fashion.
- Everybody that's on a set - from the director to the grips to the electricians - it's all about problem solving. So, as empowered as you can make everybody feel, that's really important.
- I've been very fortunate to work with a lot of directors who understand that actors need to feel empowered in order to really do their job.
- I think that the instinct that people have when they see a beautifully produced web series is that they think it must have been made for television and they just chopped it up and put it online.
- Netflix and Hulu are just extensions of television that live on the Web.
- If you're talking about a world in which everybody is connected by computers 24 hours a day, that exists right now.
- The term 'web-series' has a stigma attached to it because it was created at a time when the only web-series that were being created were being created by people who would have loved to have a television show, but they couldn't. So they created a web-series instead, on their own dime. And those series look cheap because of it.
- It's that experienced eye that knows what the public loves and how to create that Hollywood magic that drives pop culture.
- YouTube viewers essentially curate their own content, so you could form your playlist to watch 'H+' through the eyes of one character, in chronological order, in reverse-chronological order, by geographic location. Our hope is that audiences take 'H+' into their own hands.
- After our successes on 'H+,' I'm thrilled to be returning to another digital endeavor with Bryan Singer, Jason Taylor, and the entire Bad Hat Harry team. We're excited to be building the foundations of our world with Rockzeline and Blackpills.
