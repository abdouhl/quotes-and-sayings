- My main frustration is the fear of cancer from low dose radiation, even by radiologists.
- I was the Chair of the first department of medical physics in a medical school in the U.S.
- We developed simple test tools to optimize imaging parameters. No company was interested in our idea.
- In some cases radiation reduces the incidence of cancer.
- I found collaborating with congenial doctors about problems that physicists could help solve was very satisfying. I also like educating anybody who would listen!
- In 1970 I realized that there was negligible risk from x-rays but many radiographs had poor image quality so that the risk from a false negative was significant.
- I would not encourage everyone to take up this profession. Not everyone is suited for any particular field.
- I don't display my plaques and honors. They are hidden behind a black curtain in my work room at home.
- Too many radiologists still believe there is a risk from a chest x-ray. Few radiologists can explain radiation to the patient in words the patient can understand.
- When I entered the field in July 1958 I believed what they told me about radiation risks. I spent much effort reducing the dose to patients in radiology.
- I am not unhappy that my contribution was not recognized. I am sure it helped my career.
- I have the satisfaction of knowing I did something useful for society.
- Nuclear physics is interesting but it is unlikely to help society.
- Medical physics is an applied area of physics.
- There are now over 5,000 medical physicists in the U.S more than 50 times the number in 1958.
- The growth of technology is such that it is not possible today for a nuclear physicist to switch into medical physics without training. The field is now much more technical. More training is needed to do the job.
- When I entered medical physics in 1958 there were fewer than 100 in the U.S. and I could see many opportunities to apply my knowledge of nuclear physics.
- I am now almost certain that we need more radiation for better health.
- Many Nobel Prizes are awaiting good research to understand and explain the many mysteries of our bodies, such as the basic mechanism of memory or imagination.
- I have devoted much time and energy to helping medical physics in developing countries.
- If someone is interested in medicine and also in physics and they like working with people and communicate well with others, I would strongly encourage them.
- I am sure that I have been much more useful to society as a medical physicist.
- Most medical physicists work in the physics of radiation oncology making sure that the desired dose is given to the cancer and the dose to normal tissues are minimized.
- Medical physicists work in cooperation with doctors. A few medical physicists devote their time to research and teaching. A few get involved with administrative duties.
- I started the nuclear medicine laboratory at UW Hospitals in 1959 and trained radiology residents in the field. It was 1965 before they found a trained MD (doctor) to take over my role.
- It is likely that we need more radiation to improve our longevity.
