- If you have a film that's talking about God, you would think that it would appeal to people that consider themselves religious, whatever denomination they're attached to.
- In my experience, not just in shooting films but in the commercials I've done, initially, it's very exciting for the community, and its a real novelty. Very quickly, though, they realize there's a buck to be had, and it becomes annoying, and they lose their patience pretty quick.
- I cited 'Catch-22' as a landmark film and one of my favourites.
- Like a lot of films at the end of 2008, they hit a wall with financing, which is why I moved back onto 'Stone.' In doing so, I had to let go of 'The Beautiful and the Damned,' to at least give them an opportunity to move forward with somebody else.
- I sort of came from a big family - eight kids - and I guess I always, more than most people, really revel in privacy and solitude sometimes.
- 'Tracks' is based on the book by Robyn Davidson who, in the mid-Seventies, decided to leave the city, go to the outback, learn to train camels and walk across the Australian desert to the ocean: a journey that is about two thousand miles and will take about six or seven months.
- As long as there's really good actors that use their clout to support fringe films, whatever genre it is, they'll still get made.
- The worst thing for a filmmaker is for a film to be labeled as pretentious or heavy-handed.
- There's something about Alan Arkin. Even when he's doing nothing, he makes me laugh. I've always had that reaction to him: he's got a weary world-view that makes him perfectly cast.
- I like to think of myself as the host at a party, and, if everybody is having a good time, so much the better.
- The spirit around leaving New York, for me, was that I just felt I needed to do something really outside of my comfort zone. And I really couldn't tell you at the time why I needed to do it. It wasn't like I was running from something dark; it was a desire to shake things up.
- I personally think that's incredibly therapeutic to just be alone in your own thoughts and not be freaking out.
- I lived in New York City, and when I was about 24 in the 1980s, I decided to get out of here. I wanted to go live in Australia for a year or something, and it ended up being 18 years.
- A film is different than a script. The text of the script is what it is.
- I'm not the kind of director who imposes his processes on everybody else.
