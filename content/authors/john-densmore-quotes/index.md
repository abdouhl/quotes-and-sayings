- As long as there's young people, they can look to Jim to help them cut the umbilical chord.
- Jazz musicians are spiritual by nature.
- I'm happy with how 'Feast Of Friends' finally turned out. It's been bootlegged so much, and of course, the quality was always crappy with those things.
- In the '60s, the Sunset Strip became insane. The sidewalks and the traffic were jammed. It was a renaissance.
- I don't like totally free jazz, unless it's done by somebody like Coltrane, who did bebop and cool jazz, so he was allowed to go out there.
- President Obama should pardon Leonard Peltier, or at least commute his sentence, not just for humanitarian reasons, but also as a way of acknowledging the injustice suffered by Native Americans.
- Most of what is said by candidates on the right is half-baked truths and fabrications coated in 'patriotism or family values.'
- Writing is looking for music between sentences.
- Some genres of rock 'n' roll attract more of the party animals. I guess the Stones partied a bit. I think The Doors were more like The Beatles backstage - friends hanging out and whatever. It wasn't crazy. Everything was pretty subdued.
- Well, I've discovered that I really like writing, and I feel that I'm good at it.
- Jim Morrison wrote the words for 'Hello, I Love You' when we were still in a band called Rick & the Ravens.
- When I was in my 20s I went through my testosterone phase and had a Mercedes to show that I'm rich, and they used to call me 'Jaguar John.' I'm older now, and I'm concerned about the environment and... appreciate a car that doesn't pollute.
- First of all, Turtle Island is the name of this continent we live on... that's right, not 'America... as in North America,' but the name given by the first peoples of this land.
- At the risk of sounding grandiose, I will say that, to me, rock 'n' roll is sacred.
- I'm not against a new band doing commercials to pay the rent.
- Jim had a spirit that was incapable of compromise.
- The one constant thread through my life so far is that I have been constantly fed and nourished by music.
- The Stones without Mick. The Police without Sting. The Doors without Jim. It doesn't work.
- When Dudamel is up on the podium, he truly is 'inside' the music. It courses in his veins, mixing with his blood.
- I got Cs in English at school. I hated it. But now I want to be a writer and I'm voracious for new vocabulary and new ideas.

- In the '50s, West L.A. was like Kansas.

- Being a writer is a very difficult craft. Just like learning an instrument, it takes a long time and I couldn't really say I was a writer even after my first memoir.
- The whole world is hopefully heading toward democracy.
- I remember thinking: 'Why is Jim's face so big?' on the cover of our first album, 'The Doors.' Probably because it wouldn't have sold a lot of copies if it were my face!
- Yes, the '60s went too far, but we were trying to find new ways, better ways, to do things. And great seeds were planted: civil rights, the peace movement, the environmental movement, feminism. They're big seeds. They take a long time to come to fruition. Please, let's stop fighting, and get out our water cans.
- Why is there such passion for any sort of gossipy, provocative sensual stuff? It sells!
- I like myself being a survivor.
- Bass players and drummers are like brothers, working in the basement, cooking up the groove. If they don't lock together with the feel, the ensemble will suck.
- Echo & the Bunnymen just copied 'People Are Strange,' which is cool, we made some money, thanks. But when an artist finds a new interpretation of one of your songs, that's great. It turns your head around.
- I grew up listening to my parents' albums. Many of them were either classical - Bach, Beethoven and Brahms - or easy listening, like Mantovani. I loved the spectrum of emotions in classical music, from fortissimo to pianissimo. My early passion for classical made my drumming more musical later on.
- We used to build our cities and towns around churches. Now banks are at the centers of our densely populated areas.
- Money is like fertiliser. When spread around, things grow; when it's hoarded, it stinks.
- Everybody is a seeker to a degree.
- Creativity and self-destruction sometimes come in the same package.
- I've hung out and performed with many Native American musicians, and my experience is that the first peoples of this land are incredibly open, warm and forgiving.
- I do think if we had a draft again, the United States would embark on fewer wars.
- Death trumps everything.
- Ray grew up in Chicago so he had the blues, Muddy Waters and all that. He also had classical training. That was pretty cool. That was invoked in the intro to 'Light My Fire,' which was very kind of Bach-like.
- I like connecting new synapses. Like Jim Morrison did.
- Sometimes I'll be in an elevator and I'll hear a corny instrumental version of 'Light My Fire.'
- A major component of jazz is improvisation, which forces you to stay in the moment because you never know what will be coming up. There's a lot of freedom and space available as you improvise around the chord changes.
- The '50s were so lame they produced the '60s!
- The Doors are Ray, Robby, Jim and John.
- In the 1950s, my family first lived in West Los Angeles. Dad was studying architecture at USC and we didn't have a lot of money. He'd buy crumbling fixer-uppers, make repairs and sell them for a small profit. Then we'd move on. My early childhood image of him is standing on a ladder and sanding the front door.
- Legislating morality doesn't work (see: Prohibition). It produced the Mafia.
- I love 'L.A. Woman.'
- Pete Townshend keeps fooling us again, selling Who songs to yuppies hungry for SUVs.
- Ravi Shankar was an incredible teacher. I sat on stage with Robby Krieger and studied at his school of Indian music here in L.A., so at Royce Hall we were sitting next to him watching his hands bleed while he got possessed. This is the highest level you can get.
- I had no clue of Hollywood until I became a teenager. Then I got a fake ID in Tijuana and discovered Shelly's Manne-Hole, on Cahuenga and Selma, where I saw John Coltrane and his piano player, McCoy Tyner, and Elvin Jones, the drummer - my idol.
- Every new generation seems to have to go through its Doors rite of passage.
- Everyone is so desperate to get attention for their project, they will do almost anything, and the corporate world has always encouraged this.
- I'm from the Vietnam generation.
- I sometimes joke that I'm half Jewish, because I was raised Catholic... and we share 'the guilt.'
- Everything Bernie Sanders says in his speeches is based on facts and is about empowering people, not making them angry.
- One has to be always be on guard, because mega-success comes up behind you when you're high from all the attention, and sucks the vitality out of one's creativity.
- In my old age, I've learned that if I put the right cymbal crash in the very right spot, exactly, it can be as powerful as all my showoff drum rolls in my 20s.
- Anyone can play Doors songs, unless it's for an ad for some product.
- Jim was Dionysus, but it took three Apollos to balance that Dionysian energy. He was a force.
- I'm not the fastest drummer in the world, but I'm very into dynamics and knowing that there's space in between the notes and you got to breathe.
- Painters 'see' the world; musicians 'hear' it.
- Many years ago, I spent 5k at a fundraiser to hang with another lame duck: Bill Clinton. I lobbied him to pardon Leonard Peltier, the Nelson Mandela of Native Americans.
- We were not folk-rock. We would scare people.
- If somebody makes a really wonderful, ecological car, I'm down, no matter where it comes from.
- We all liked Elektra because it was a boutique label. 'Oh, my God, we can be on the same label as Paul Butterfield!'
- When I was 15, we settled in Santa Monica, in a beige suburban ranch house. By then, my father, Ray, was an architect at Welton Becket's firm. He was handy with a pencil and pen. His figurative drawings were very good, and his talent was intimidating.
- The End' eventually became the encore at all of our big concerts. We would play 'Light My Fire,' and there would be this incredible Summer Of Love '60s thing, and then we'd come out and bludgeon them with 'The End.'
- When I do a press roll, I use the traditional grip. Sometimes I flip it around; for a louder crack on the two and four, I use the new grip.
- Ulcers come from not dealing with something.
- I had the first XJ6 and then they became real popular with lawyers so I had to move on. The only problem with Jaguar is that you have to go to the gas station every couple blocks, and a mechanic once told me that if you don't have the right attitude when you walk up to a Jag, it won't start.
- For us, anyone can record our songs. Anyone can cover our songs.
- In the end, I have a nice house and groovy cars, and so do my bandmates. It's not like they're starving.
- I mean, take 'Chariots Of Fire.' That opening scene, the long shot of the runners along the beach, and then you hear that music... I think that was one of the first times synthesizers were really used in movie music. I just flipped! I didn't even care what the story was going to be. Give me a nice marriage of sound and music.
- When rock loses integrity it's time for renewal.
- The Doors are etched on my forehead and always will be.
- I used to say, if Jim were alive today he'd never be clean and sober but I'm changing that answer because Eminem - angry, creative, just like Jim; a real talent - and Clapton, of course. It's a different time so he would have learned something, I think, but I don't protect what he did.
- I still think that if one of Jim's masterpieces were downgraded to sell crap, I would get sick.
- You know, another jazz drummer, Ed Thigpen, who played with Oscar Peterson way back - it was the first time I ever heard rivets in a cymbal. And then I heard that Chico Hamilton had them too, and I went, 'Oh, that's it. I'm taking that for my sound.' And it worked well on 'Riders On The Storm,' so that's one thing.
- Wouldn't it be nice if human nature could learn stuff before we get to the brink? It seems we have to experience it first.
- I like driving at least a part-time electric car because there's nothing coming out of the tailpipe. That's very important to me.
- I like to drum for various theatrical things.
- If I had been the drummer for the Grassroots, it probably wouldn't have cut me to the core when I heard John Lennon's 'Revolution' selling tennis shoes... and Nikes, to boot! That song was the soundtrack to part of my youth, when the streets were filled with passionate citizens expressing their First Amendment right to free speech.
- There were some hardcore fans who thought I was ruining the band they loved. And now there's this document, 'The Doors Unhinged,' which, hopefully, they'll take away that I was trying to preserve the band they love and its legacy.
- Eddie Vedder? My God, there's a singer.
- The fossil fuel industry has made advocating alternative energy sources a liberal/conservative thing, and an ideological battle, when it should really be about a healthier, less toxic world.
- My mom, Peggy, was a free spirit. She loved music and liked to paint. She had received her degree from Chouinard Art Institute in L.A.
- Some kids went to the movies for escape. We found it with jazz. This is where we got religion. It was a kind of raw spiritual anarchy.
- You hear a Willie Nelson solo, he doesn't play real fast, but it's so melodic and beautiful. It's kind of, to be human is to have space and not show all your stuff all the time.
- It's your inner life that's the most important.
- If you surrender to the communal vision, sometimes, certainly in our case, you become more than the sum of your parts.
- I knew Jim was going down, but was very pleased that somehow, despite his self-destruction, when we rehearsed, wrote songs and recorded, he showed up. He pulled it together.
- Jim had melodies as well as words. He didn't know how to play a chord on any instrument, but he had melodies in his head. To remember the lyrics he would think of melodies and then they would stay in his head. He had melodies and lyrics in his head, and he would sing them a cappella, and we would eke out the arrangements.
- We drummers all know that our mother's heartbeat was the first instrument we heard. As a race, we've all been trying to get back to that womb. That's why rhythm makes us move... dance.
- Certainly, we are all on the shoulders of those who fought for our country. But the first peoples of this land justifiably might feel bitterness.
- Even though the white-haired politician has no colorful wardrobe, after he speaks... you want to hug him. Why? Because what Bernie Sanders says feels like the truth. The unbridled truth. And he says it loud.
- We knew we were tight and good, but we didn't know we were going to be the band to help each generation cut its umbilical cord.
- I really wanted to be in Love - they were making it. But I was in the demon Doors.
- Sound is everything to a musician.
