- As long as I'm working, I'm happy. You see my face - great. You don't see my face - too bad, I don't care. I'll keep going.
- I love nothing better than a dirty cartoon. I think that it's really, really funny to see adult themes in a genre that's usually directed towards children.
- Any voice where you've got to scream over a battle or whatever, that's always difficult. It's harder than it seems.
- I wasn't hip to 'Samurai Jack' until I saw it, but then I was all, 'This show is awesome!'
- Tell me that you don't like cartoons, and I think there's something wrong with you. I don't understand why people don't like cartoons.
- 'Futurama' was a big deal. People had already started to hear about me a little bit here and there, but that was the first series I booked to be a regular on.
- Any good production team is going to allow an actor to breathe life into the characters - that's why they hired that woman, that man, whatever the case.
- I don't like it when celebrities get voice work. But then again, if I was the producer, I wouldn't want a bunch of no-names doing my show and have to worry about word-of-mouth. I see both sides of the story.
- I had always been heavily influenced by stand-up. I was in a comedy team called Red Johnny And The Round Guy.
- As a standup comedian, you have to develop a sense of fearlessness. It's really important for your livelihood and your well-being. And if you don't do that, you're going to fail; you're never going to be able to stand up on the cliff and jump off.
