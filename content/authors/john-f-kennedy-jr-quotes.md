- It would be disingenuous to say I don't have some sensitivity to the seamy side of issues.
- I have a pretty normal life, surprisingly.
- For me, the marriage of publishing and politics simply weaves together the two family businesses.
- We grew up in my family thinking that politics was a really fascinating way to spend one's career and a way to be involved in the issues of the day. And certainly, my father and my relatives really loved all that.
- In the same way that some magazines have made financial markets accessible to people who don't want that much sophisticated information, we would like to make information about public issues accessible in a way that makes people feel included.
- I have a slight contrarian impulse I can't seem to shake.
- The only person I've been able to get to go up with me, who looks forward to it as much as I do, is my wife. Whenever we want to get away, we can just get in a plane and fly off.
- We want to make politics sort of entertaining. If it is entertaining, people are going to be interested in it, and if they are interested in it, they might think more about it and maybe involve themselves in some way down the line.
- I would wear one of those plastic pocket protectors, but they make you look like a Republican.
- I think everyone needs to feel they've created something that was their own, on their own terms.
- If you're trying to talk about public issues and politics and showcase it in a positive, different way, I think people like the idea.
- My mother knew something about politics.
- I'm not a big planner. Things always sort of surprise me.
- I don't really go out a lot.
- People have an interest in the controversial.
- My mother kept every single thing that she ever got in her life.
- Sometimes the weight of expectations, of doing anything, can be a little bit heavy.
- Listen, in the same way that politics and government allow people to engage in large issues, media does the same.
- It's hard for me to talk about a legacy or a mystique. It's my family. The fact that there have been difficulties and hardships, or obstacles, makes us closer.
- My mother obviously was in the publishing business.
- Anyone who's in the magazine business thinks about advertisers when they write about something. And anyone who says they don't is a liar.
- My family is used to all manner of controversy.
- I obviously grew up with politics and have always been interested in ways in which people can get involved with it and be stimulated by it.
- What happens is that every August photographers camp out in Hyannis Port. So anytime I go down to the beach, or go to the pier or whatever, there's no avoiding them.
- There are nuts in this country.
- As a younger brother, you look up to your sister.
- I've done everything from research to stuffing envelopes.
- I'm clearly not a major legal genius.
