- For interns at 'The Weekly Standard' or 'National Review,' where the martial instinct finds its most insistent voice, what Robert Kagan calls the military 'career path' is not widely seen as a plausible future. Pulling a trigger is what Jose, Tyrone, and Bubba do, not early admission students at the better private universities.

- 'Time' was a glorious place to work in the years that I was there, from 1959 to 1964.
- I love cops; I'm fascinated by the criminal justice system.
- I resist and resent the idea of California as a metaphor. It's something thrust upon us, usually by people in the East.
- The self-image of many contemporary sportswriters seems to depend on maintaining that were it not for sports, athletes would be pumping gas, if they were not sticking up the gas station.
- An Episcopalian military institution when it was founded near the turn of the century, Harvard for years had an implicit quota system that effectively limited the number of Jewish admissions.
- Writing well about sports is as difficult as writing well about sex.
- Being a professional screenwriter is perhaps the hardest occupation. Because nothing is ever yours and, by the nature of the medium, you are never ultimately responsible for your work. It can be interesting - if you have another outlet.
- There are no new facts about the Kennedys, only new attitudes, a literature that, like the automobile industry, puts new bodies on old chassis.
- For thirty-five years, David Halberstam, an unsilent member of the Silent Generation, has contemplated America and its place in the world, casting his eye on big subjects - Vietnam, global economics, race, mass media, and the 1950s.
- Conspiracy is a small but durable seller, retooled every year or so.
- Only World War II, which mobilized 10 million draftees, could by any stretch of the imagination be called a people's war.

- A writer is an eternal outsider, his nose pressed against whatever window on the other side of which he sees his material.
- I am willing to believe, but I do not have the gift of faith. I'm skeptical.
- Anecdotes are factoids of questionable provenance, burnished to a high gloss, often set in gilded venues and populated with familiar names as background atmosphere, purged of ambiguity in the interest of keeping the narrative flowing smoothly.
- Were it not for Jackie Robinson, Branch Rickey would be remembered, if at all, as a Bible-thumping midwestern Methodist windbag who neither played baseball on Sundays when he was a mediocre catcher for the St. Louis Browns and the New York Highlanders, nor attended games on the Sabbath as a baseball executive.

- Retirement is purgatory for the former sports star. The world outside organized sports is unforgiving.
- Life is much more available in New York - there are a dozen movie theaters within walking distance. Living in California is easier, but you get sedentary.
- Most anyplace one lives is essentially dangerous. There are floods in the Midwest, and tornadoes. There are hurricanes along the Gulf. In New York, you get mugged.
- I liked Los Angeles for odd reasons. For one, there was no sense of community. You were really left to your own resources, spending this inordinate amount of time alone in a balloon of an automobile. I liked that a lot.
- Membership in the closed society of the motion-picture industry is almost never revoked for moral failings.
- Unlike Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods, Jackie Robinson never tried to convert himself into an acceptable black man.
- Class was always the domestic issue during the Vietnam War, not communism.
