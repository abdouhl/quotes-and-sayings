- The only reason I got into movies was because I had no music talent.
- I don't want to be too cool. You get so caught up with whether you're doing it right.
- I don't consider myself qualified to do a movie about international intrigue - I seldom leave the country.

- When I go to a concert, I can't believe that people pay lots of money to see a band that they obviously like and then they dance the whole time.
- My heroes were Dylan, John Lennon and Picasso, because they each moved their particular medium forward, and when they got to the point where they were comfortable, they always moved on.
- I don't think I'm making any great statements, and I certainly don't think I'm making art.
- A nerd will be a nerd all his life.
- When I did 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off', I had the idea on Monday and the following Tuesday it was in budget at Paramount. I couldn't walk.
- Why watch someone kissing when people really close their eyes when they kiss?
- I don't think of kids as a lower form of the human species.
- It's like being at the kids' table at Thanksgiving - you can put your elbows on it, you don't have to talk politics... no matter how old I get, there's always a part of me that's sitting there.
- Many filmmakers portray teenagers as immoral and ignorant, with pursuits that are pretty base... But I haven't found that to be the case. I listen to kids. I respect them... Some of them are as bright as any of the adults I've met.
- What a director should be doing is making it appear as though there was no script.
- I find that screen kissing wears very thin very quickly.

- My generation had to be taken seriously because we were stopping things and burning things. We were able to initiate change, because we had such vast numbers. We were part of the baby boom, and when we moved, everything moved with us.
- People forget that when you're 16, you're probably more serious than you'll ever be again. You think seriously about the big questions.
- When I approach a band, I want to respect them and be respectful of their music. I'm not gonna say, 'Look, you guys are real hot, so we'll stick you in the movie, and we'll get it in all these stores and all these stations.' That isn't right.
- I didn't have this tortured childhood; I liked it.
- At the time I came along, Hollywood's idea of teen movies meant there had to be a lot of nudity, usually involving boys in pursuit of sex, and pretty gross overall. Either that or a horror movie. And the last thing Hollywood wanted in their teen movies was teenagers!
- If I'm on a roll, and I finish a script at 3:00, I'll start another at 3:02.
- I happen to go for the simplest, most ordinary things. The extraordinary doesn't interest me. I'm not interested in psychotics. I'm interested in the person you don't expect to have a story. I like Everyman.
