- Growing up in an atmosphere of storytelling made me an actor.

- I'm too much of a Libra. I too often see the other person's point of view and capitulate, even though I have strong political convictions. It's just my liability. Maybe I'm too empathetic. That's the actor in me.
- Academics tend to have wonderfully infantile senses of humor.
- I grew up with this crazy upbringing of living many places and always being the new kid in town, not like a service brat where you're always going to school with other new kids in town.

- I got to have a great big knock-down, drag-out fight with Sylvester Stallone. Every actor should have that much fun at some point. You can hit him as hard as you can, and it's never enough for him.

- If you go through your life being completely truthful, everybody will hate you, and something I deeply fear is being hated.

- I like to rehearse and rehearse and have everything exactly calculated before we start shooting - probably to a fault.

- I am in the business of exploring crazy possibilities.
- No villain thinks of himself as a villain, and that's the approach I always take.
- Voice work is fun. But about three-quarters of the things you enjoy about acting are just not there. You're not working with another actor; you're not working with an audience. You're just working with a bunch of writers and a microphone. It's very abstract.

- I'm as vain as the next person, but I've made so much fun of myself over the years, and that's very salutary as you grow older.

- If I don't enjoy it, there's something seriously wrong. There's a reason why they call it playing, what we do. It's ecstatic fun, and I overdo it - I mean, I can't seem to stop - people ask me to act, and I say yes.

- Britain is probably the most sophisticated combination of a monarchy and a democracy.

- When people are taking something extremely seriously, that's the time to take out the pig's bladder.
- What you aspire to on a sitcom is the feeling of live comedy.

- I am a storyteller, and the stories I tell are, when I'm lucky, really good ones. It's a very exciting thing to do with your life, and that's, I think, what keeps me hopeful.
- In animation, there's this exhilarating moment of discovery when you see the film and you say, Oh THAT'S what I was doing.
