- Britain has moved on. It is a radically different country from that which shaped New Labour.

- If Marx was alive during the Stalinist period, he'd be first to be in the gulag.

- If we as a party are serious about devolution, then we must respect councils and nations enough to determine their own agenda.

- When I was a GLC councillor, we won and held London as Labour was imploding nationally - running popular campaigns against the Thatcher Government and fighting on our own agenda.

- The decision over Heathrow expansion exemplifies the style of policy-making that starts with capitulation to a powerful self-interested lobby, blatantly fixes a public consultation and then drives through a policy that destroys any vestiges of green credentials the government had left.
- Political rivalry is one thing but personal smear campaigns scrape the barrel of political infighting.

- Conservatives claim they are 'one nation' Tories when they have actually been a government for the 1% who have undermined our economic interests through their greed.
- Politicians have patronised and talked down to us all when it comes to our economy, but ordinary working people have to manage on incomes significantly lower than the likes of George Osborne and his friends in the City. They could teach the bankers and many commentators a thing or two about managing a budget responsibly.

- I've always said the left needs to be ready for government.
- As the world changes, the way we work changes with it.
