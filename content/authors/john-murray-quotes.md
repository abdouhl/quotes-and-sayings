- Development in this county is always going to be an issue. Until development and zoning are handled on a regional basis, rather than each municipality left to its own devices, we will suffer from developers having the upper hand in suits and in front of zoning boards.
- Taking Big Bird away from our five year olds, lunch money away from our ten year olds, job training programs away from our fifteen year olds, and college loans away from our twenty year olds is a disgrace.
- It's nice to have a lot of people in the field. Independent, third party, Libertarian, Reform and other party candidates can do what they want to do. I welcome them to the race.
- Education, when delivered properly, can benefit a lot of people and make productive citizens out of those otherwise given no hope.
- They see themselves as athletes and only athletes.
- I'd like to see an arrested growth of development. You can't stop it, but it's important we do something about the developers having the upper hand.
- The pain of retirement means loss.
- So I will stand more steadfastly for the things I stand up for, like people who work for a living. I'd like to be able to stand that way when I go to Congress.
- Give the people not hell, but hope and courage.
- All elections revolve around and are often resolved by who raises the most money. That's unfair. I'd like to see that process changed, but it seems once you win and get to Congress, that doesn't happen.
