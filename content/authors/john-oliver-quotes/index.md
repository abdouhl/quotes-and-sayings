- People, I guess, generally come to see me do stand-up with a working knowledge of my broad sense of humor on 'The Daily Show'... I don't think anyone would mistake me as an actual anchor.
- I think puns are not just the lowest form of wit, but the lowest form of human behavior.
- My family are from Liverpool, so I have some twang there - I have a Midlands accent, and I was raised about an hour north of London, so my voice is a mess. Although, to American ears, it sounds like the crisp language of a queen's butler.
- Campaign ads are the backbone of American democracy if American democracy suffered a gigantic spinal injury.
- I would hate to meet myself at 15.
- I've always been interested in socially political, or overtly political, comedy.
- When you're doing stand-up, you want to stand onstage and, to the extent that you can, uncomplicatedly entertain.
- Every empire has to get sucked down the drain. As a British person, I know how it feels.

- Southern people are bigger-hearted and kinder than I had any right to expect.
- As any Brit will understand, things get a little easier when you don't have to be number one any more. Really, the fall of an empire is not as bad as everyone thinks. It's like retirement. People fear retirement, but it can turn out be rather pleasant.
- Stand-up comedy seems like a terrifying thing. Objectively. Before anyone has done it, it seems like one of the most frightening things you could conceive, and there's just no shortcut - you just have to do it.
- It's pretty physically unsettling, living life on a visa.
- My first 'Daily Show' piece was pretending I had this terrible immigrant journey, so I went to talk to an immigration lawyer who would help out people, and I ran into him in Penn Station about three months after I'd gotten the green card. I said, 'I got my green card yesterday.' And he hugged me because he understood that level of relief.
- When you're dealing with serious subjects, there is a pressure to be absolutely sure that you know what you're doing.
- Most stand-ups, once they have done it, think of it as their default job. I'm pretty sure Jon Stewart still feels that way now. You are a stand-up first; other things come and go.
- People really have come for a dialogue when they go to a stand-up show in the U.K. They say, 'I understand that you have now finished your little comedy monologue; now I have something to say regarding what I've just heard.
- The British media is sinking down, as the American news media has lowered the bar for all of humanity. British news media is definitely trying to stoop down to that level. Everyone is stooping to the lowest common denominator.
- I've always been interested in socially political, or overtly political, comedy. And I guess I've always liked to channel some kind of personal element to that.
- There's never any time I think I'm a real journalist, because I don't have any of the qualifications or the intentions for that.
- People are friendlier in New York than London.
- In improv, the whole thing is that it is a relationship between the two people, as a back and forth. In standup, you don't really want to be listening to what somebody is saying; you want to project your jokes into their face. And that's really not a good instinct with a 'Daily Show' field piece, where it's supposed to be an interview.
- The moment I accept that there's an artistic, redeeming quality in puns, I have a horrible feeling I'll get hooked.
- I did sketch comedy, but I never did improv. So I've just tried to learn as I go.
- There are so many low points with stand-up. You are perpetually humiliated, so it doesn't really matter anymore. I don't have any dignity left to lose. An audience can't hurt you anymore when you've been completely dismantled.
- I've made so many people angry that they kind of blur into one unpleasant memory of people staring at you with somewhere between passive aggression and active aggression.
- People in Britain see Richard Quest as a kind of an offensive cartoon character.
- I knew I was going to go into the field and make fun of people to their faces. I knew what I was getting into.

- There is no greater anesthetic than sport.
- Veterans' issues are quite close to my heart. I find it quite hard to talk about, actually.
- I'm not really much of an actor, so when I started on 'The Daily Show,' I was just trying to adopt the faux authority of a newsperson. Having a British accent definitely gave me a sonic leg up on that because there is a faux authority to the British accent in and of itself.
- Stand-up, for me, is really more of an addiction, so you have to feed the beast whenever you can.
- I watch one news channel until my soul can't take it anymore. It's the background of my life.

- I have occasionally - if ever I do interviews that are difficult or nerve-wracking - I take my wife's dog tags and have them in my pocket because it's a very quick way to realize that what I'm doing is not that important. It's not really worth getting stressed about because it's not, you know, war.

- I've said yes to everything that Jon Stewart has asked me to do. That's been a pretty good career decision, I think.
- In improv, the whole thing is that it is a relationship between the two people, as a back and forth. In standup, you don't really want to be listening to what somebody is saying; you want to project your jokes into their face.
- Americans just don't understand dry wit.
- My family is from Liverpool, so I have some of those vowel sounds, I've got the slack tone of someone from Birmingham, and then I was raised in Bedford, which is just north of London. So my accent, if it's possible, makes even less sense to a Brit than to an American.
- Attending a Sarah Palin rally was simultaneously one of the strangest and most chilling events of my life.
- I have exactly as much rhythm as you think I have.

- You just try to be true to your idea of what is funny and what is also interesting.
- I think Americans still can't help but respond to the natural authority of this voice. Deep down they long to be told what to do by a British accent. That's why so many infomercials have British people.
- Australia turns out to be a sensational place, albeit one of the most comfortably racist places I've ever been in. They've really settled into their intolerance like an old resentful slipper.
- I do one accent - my own. I can make it louder or quieter. That is the sum total of my vocal range. I thought I could do an American accent until I tried it in front of an American - the expression of horror is still burnt onto my retinas.
- When you've married someone who's been at war, there is nothing you can do that compares to that level of selflessness and bravery.
- I wanted to be a soccer player. I knew that couldn't happen.
- Politicians don't really bring up religion in England.

- It really helps a comedian to be an outsider.
- If you work on a comedy show, your basic form of communication is teasing. That's generally how we speak to each other: you communicate the information between the lines of insulting sentences.
- The British press are a group of unremitting scumbags. And sometimes they use that scumbaggery to good ends, and often not.
- I really love stand-up. I'm more than happy to do it for nothing. I've come to America to do it for nothing. It's the American Dream: Work for free.
- You don't really know when stand-up material is TV ready; it's just at what point you're willing to let it go and not work on it anymore. I'm not sure there is a point at which you think: 'And that is finished.'
