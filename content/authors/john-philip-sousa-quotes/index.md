- Composers are the only people who can hear good music above bad sounds.
- America can well expect to develop a goodly amount of composers for she has a goodly number of people.
- There is one thing that freezes a musician more than the deadliest physical cold, and that is the spiritual chill of an unresponsive audience!
- My success is not due to any personal superiority over other people.
- I think that the quality of all bands is steadily improving and it is a pleasant thought to me that perhaps the efforts of Sousa's Band have quickened that interest and improved that quality.
- Jazz will endure just as long people hear it through their feet instead of their brains.
- I have always believed that 98% of a student's progress is due to his own efforts, and 2% to his teacher.
- Governmental aid is a drawback rather than an assistance, as, although it may facilitate in the routine of artistic production, it is an impediment to the development of true artistic genius.
- I still feel the impulse to give young writers a hearing, and I believe I have played more unpublished compositions than any other band leader in the country.
- I can almost always write music; at any hour of the twenty-four, if I put pencil to paper, music comes.

- The movements which I make I cannot possibly repress because, at the time, I am actually the idea I am interpreting, and naturally I picture my players and auditors as in accord with me. I know, of course, that my mannerisms have been widely discussed.
- The office of President is a great one; to every true American it seems the greatest on earth. And to me, as I was engaged in weaving a background of music for the pageantry of it, there came a deeper realization of the effect of that office on the man.
- Sincere composers believe in God.
- The average music-lover hears only the production under prevailing conditions.
- Remember always that the composer's pen is still mightier than the bow of the violinist; in you lie all the possibilities of the creation of beauty.
- I am happy now, to recall that I was not only his son but his companion, and whenever there was a hunting expedition or any other pleasure, I was always with him.
- American teachers have one indisputable advantage over foreign ones; they understand the American temperament and can judge its unevenness, its lights and its shadows.
- No nation as young as America can be expected to become immediately a power in the arts.
- From childhood I was passionately fond of music and wanted to be a musician. I have no recollection of any real desire ever to be anything else.
- Grand opera is the most powerful of stage appeals and that almost entirely through the beauty of music.
- Any composer who is gloriously conscious that he is a composer must believe that he receives his inspiration from a source higher than himself.
- Anybody can write music of a sort. But touching the public heart is quite another thing.
- Is it not the business of the conductor to convey to the public in its dramatic form the central idea of a composition; and how can he convey that idea successfully if he does not enter heart and soul into the life of the music and the tale it unfolds?
- I had found English audiences highly satisfactory. They are the best listeners in the world. Perhaps the music-lovers of some of our larger cities equal the English, but I do not believe they can be surpassed in that respect.
- To the average mind popular music would mean compositions vulgarly conceived and commonplace in their treatment. That is absolutely false.
