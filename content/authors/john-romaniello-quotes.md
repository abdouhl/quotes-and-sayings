- I've often said that while gaining muscle can be very difficult, it's also pretty simple - at the heart of it, you just need to take in more energy than you expend, and use an intelligent program. This is especially true for beginners.
- Strictly speaking, intensity in the weight training context refers to the amount of work required to achieve the activity and is proportional to the mass of the weights being lifted - that is, how heavy the weight is relative to how strong you are.
- For people like me, books are something solid and real, whereas digital stuff is a bit more ethereal. I like the trophy on my shelf, the presence in my home. A nice book is just as valuable as a decoration as a beautiful porcelain urn - and, let's face it, a hell of a lot more useful.
- The best training program in the world is absolutely worthless without the will to execute it properly, consistently, and with intensity.
- 'Freedom dieters' often do well with programs that incorporate pretty basic rules, like intermittent fasting - simply don't eat for X period of time, then eat healthy foods. Very simple.
- If your diet is dialed in, you can train in a pretty subpar manner and still get passable results. On the other hand, if your training is fantastic but your diet is crap, you have a harder road ahead of you.
- 'Rules dieters' find limitations oddly freeing, because the restrictions create a framework that's easy to follow. Essentially, rules dieters don't do well when they're let off plan, mainly because they are usually emotionally attached to food in some way.
- Full-body workouts are great for someone who can only train a few times per week, as missing one day will be less detrimental.
- My clients train hard. They don't scream or throw weights - they just push hard, trying to get more out of themselves than their bodies want to give, trying to walk that terrible, beautiful line between controlled aggression and all-out insanity.
- If getting a great body was easy, every woman would look Jessica Biel, and every guy would have a body like Kellan Lutz.
- Some people are great at dieting and train somewhat inconsistently - for those people, getting on a great training program and following it will be the best thing for you.
- Ultimately, I'm in the fitness industry. But, I've branched out from there quite a bit. I began doing consulting on writing and getting published in magazines in about 2011. Right around that time, I started doing some angel investing and looking to grow my skills and general experience outside of that.
- Agents are deal makers, and they're really, really good at making deals. But they're also exceptionally helpful after the deal is made - agents act as a good intermediary between authors and publishers whenever disagreements come up.
- I occasionally read digital books when I'm traveling, but I do so begrudgingly.
