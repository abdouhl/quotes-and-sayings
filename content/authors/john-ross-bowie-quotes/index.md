- 'Speechless' is first and foremost a show about a family that doesn't have a ton of money, but they move into a really crappy house in a really nice neighborhood so their kids can go to a nice school.
- I don't really have guilty pleasures - I like what I like. But I've seen a lot - a lot - of 'Taxicab Confessions.'

- I love coffee.

- The days are long. I'm not complaining, but it's a lot of work doing a single-camera comedy.
- I came out of UCB and, before that, punk rock, and the whole deal was you do it yourself. Get up and rent the space, get up and press your own records, get up and silkscreen your own tees, get it done yourself. That sort of self-reliance will only serve me. Any time I lose sight of that, my career suffers.
- We just can't scare our kids by living in fear.
- Commercials led to TV, and TV led to movies here and there.
- Your kids have these big emotions they can't put into words.
- I guess that's the big challenge of any art: Do you want to be something for everyone or everything for someone?
- There's a certain steely resolve when you decide to live in a city and decide to raise children in the city. And if you're doing it properly, you have sort of a heightened awareness anyway.
- Humor is a way to deal with stresses. It is a way to cope.
- I think punk rock needs an 'Amadeus.'
- 'Anchorman' is really good.
