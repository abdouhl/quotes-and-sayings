- Some people thrive on creating chaos and then operating through it, though usually that's presented as a female trait.
- I'm from New York, I'm 53, I have my moments when I'm a nice guy, and more frequently I have my moments where I'm a middle-aged aggravated person. For years I was always the nice guy, so in life I had to pretend to be the nice guy.

- 'Gut' was my nickname. And I was picked on terribly by many, many kids.
- I'm actually from Mt. Kisco, New York, which is in Westchester County, and when I auditioned for 'Dukes,' I told them I was from Snailville, Georgia, which doesn't exist, and I'd just graduated first in my class from the Georgia School of High Performance Driving, which also doesn't exist. But they bought it.

- When a script like 'Hardflip' comes along, with a real depiction of the rewards of a father-son relationship but also the difficulties of building one, you have my attention.
- I believe you should be a gentleman, and that's old-fashioned.
- In 'Hardflip,' you have a relationship where the father and son haven't seen each other in 18 years, but they find they're very alike: pigheaded, stubborn, passionate. It's a wonderful story of how you can't get away from how similar you and your children are.
- Passion is different than desire. People that are successful recognize passion. You have to be willing to work at it. I love the image of pushing a boulder uphill - it will flourish you.
- Friends don't let friends jump cars.
- Some people treat seeing me as if they just won a car on 'The Price is Right.' The feet get going, and the hands start flapping, and it's really quite amazing. It's a little scary: you can't have more than two or three of them at the same time because someone might get hurt. But it's great fun.
- I don't know that Donald Trump really cares about what the outcome is, as long as he's in charge of it. Seeing whom he can steer in which direction and how far he can push them.

- If it's tough believing what you believe, then maybe it's time to move. But if you are someone who militantly enforces your opinion about anything, then you need to get out of town.
- People have come to me for my opinion since 'October Baby.' But, hey, look, I'm an actor who is very fortunate to be in a movie that's making wonderful noise, and hopefully helping parents and children to be a little closer. Leave me alone. I'm not talking about politics. I'm just trying to have a conversation with my own kids.
- I've been involved in the offering-up-adoption-as-another-choice business for a long time.
- My biggest change is what is important to me, and what is not. What's worthy worrying about, and what is not. When we're younger, we tend to spend too much time worrying and going over the unnecessary. I'm no longer running the hamster wheel.
- Shows have a tendency to end when they're over. 'The Dukes of Hazzard' has not ended for the fans, and it has not ended for the cast or the crew, and I'm very proud to be a part of that.

- Not many skeletons left in my closet because I invite them to dance all over the front room!
