- I get drunk writing words. I don't drink or do drugs, but I get so carried away with writing that I get inebriated from it.
- I'm not quite pompous enough to think of myself as an educator or a man capable of definitive refutation of falsehoods.
- I do sometimes watch 'Dr. Who' and while the stories barely make sense, if at all, the doctor is such great company I don't care.
- Labels only confuse people. The smarter people recognize artists who transcend categories. But I always try to entertain. It's in my nature; writers are born to entertain. If that means working ostensibly within a genre, fine.
- I'm cursed with empathy. I'm also by nature way too opinionated.
- I do try to be of some use in the world. I sometimes do volunteer work with kids, and manage to help some people a little, but really making a significant difference can be hard.
- I'm incapable of writing without social commentary. I like to think that it's integrated and not really heavy handedly didactic.
- People in extreme conditions are suddenly naked, realer than normal, perhaps even more alive.
- Innocence could be considered a discrete state of mind.
- I think paranoia can be instructive in the right doses. Paranoia is a skill.
- I'm trying to trick people into thinking about the unthinkable by using pop culture images.
