- I can't watch shows like 'The X Factor,' for instance. I just squirm for the people involved, for the way they're being used. It's the cruellest, most ridiculous show on television. It's ruined music, ruined everything.
- When I got to 40, I was happy. Now I can wear what I like, listen to what I like, don't have to try and be cool. I'm someone's dad and it doesn't matter any more. That's an enormous freedom.
- I spent most of my youth in Manchester, in clubs and football grounds and the Manchester Apollo.
- I'm incredibly proud of 'Life On Mars' and 'Doctor Who.' They're just a blast to do.
- Critics should be to actors what ornithologists are to birds: they can write all they want, but it shouldn't affect them.
- I'm not a people person. I'm not sociable. I have been and I can be, but not as a general rule.
- I love Manchester. I always have, ever since I was a kid, and I go back as much as I can. Manchester's my spiritual home. I've been in London for 22 years now but Manchester's the only other place, I think, in the country that I could live.
- I'm good at being on my own. As a kid, I was always in my room alone, so I have a high threshold for it. If I'm bored, I'll read. Hanging around doesn't go well with me.
- I think I can be closed in. I can close this outer shell, cut myself off and be quite cold. I can cut other people off if I need to. I don't think I'm angry, though... Maybe my wife would disagree.
- Twitter has restored my faith in humanity. I thought I'd hate it, but while there are lots of knobheads, there are even more lovely people. It delights me how witty and friendly most people are.
- There's something really interesting about having those close friends that you've had incredible times with but growing up and away from them. The underlying tensions, the shifting in the group dynamic, the little lies you tell to big yourself up: it's something that happens to us all.
- It's horrible to get a cameraphone shoved in your face every time you walk out the door.
- You never undertake a project because you think other people will like it - because that way lies madness - but rather because you believe in it.
- I used to be mouthy. It was all to do with being a northerner and from Manchester, which was suddenly a big deal when I was in my 20s. When I read some of the interviews I did back then, I cringe.
- Success, however you judge what that even means, brings with it certain pressures.
