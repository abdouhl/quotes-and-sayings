- I once dated someone who worked at McDonald's. She came up and asked if I wanted a Big Mac.
- I'm not the guy who bursts into the room. I'm the most insecure person you'll meet if you get to know me.
- I like when guests come over early and we chop veggies and talk and play music.
- I have never been so calculating as to sing some Barry White song to get a girl. But I do think it's very romantic to cook dinner and sit around the piano at night and sing together.
- People look at me and go, 'You must have it made. You have girls. You have a great life.' It's not true. I mean you pull the curtain away, and you see I'm just as insecure and neurotic and scared and vulnerable as anybody, you know.
- This is an old family secret, and I just found this out recently, and it almost broke my heart. My mother said to me, 'I had never told you this, but God, you were an ugly baby'.
- I have a trainer that I box with. Luckily, on ER, they'll tell me if I have a shirtless scene coming up and I'll have a few weeks to power it out.
- I mean you pull the curtain away, and you see I'm just as insecure and neurotic and scared and vulnerable as anybody, you know.
- Joining 'ER,' I felt like that kid who got the golden ticket in 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.' I've been offered chocolate bars all these years, but there had been no golden ticket. Just the stomachache that was called 'Jake in Progress.'
- Every couple years, you know, these great things drop in my lap. It's been fantastic.
- I'm happier in my career now than I've ever been.
- For so many years, fans and friends have been wanting me to succeed and be back on TV every week, which hasn't happened since 'Full House.' I feel like I came through for them.
- I got cast on ER, I knew I'd be playing a great character and I knew the show was great.
- I've had a fairy tale life. I had a perfect family, a beautiful childhood, an incredible upbringing. I lived a lot of life but a lot of good life.
- I grew up doing sitcoms and theater and even playing with the Beach Boys, where you're programmed to perform, your body gets into a rhythm and you know it has to perform.
- I think I got turned onto The Beach Boys for the first time with the 'Endless Summer' album in 1974. The power of that music still, to this day, bypasses the brain and goes straight to the heart. You don't have to think about it; it's something that you feel.
- I do know I want to have children. That's the only thing missing in my life. I certainly thought I'd have some by now.
- I started Pilates. I'm the only guy in there. They plot before I get there: 'How can we make John look ridiculous?' Because every exercise involved my legs up, like I'm in the stirrups or something.
- I've been been on the cover of TV Guide, on every single talk and entertainment show except Letterman. It's interesting being older and dealing with this kind of success. I'm more appreciative of it now, and I don't take it for granted.
- I also find it interesting that a lot of people in their 30s are not married and don't have kids. There are a lot of people in this age bracket that are out there dating and trying to find love. And I never thought that at my age I would be.
- I'm finally looking older and inviting my wrinkles.
- In the last few years, losing my father, going through a divorce and not getting some jobs I really wanted, is making me a much more interesting person, I think. This all really does feel like a rebirth, a new chapter.

- When I was 16 or 17, I remember kissing one of my first girlfriends, Kim Anderson, under a stairwell at Disneyland. I'll never forget that feeling.
- I don't want to replace anyone, especially Charlie Sheen.
- I like to sing with people, whether they're good or not.
