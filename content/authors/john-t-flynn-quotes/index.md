- I think we have to be fair in saying at this point that neither Roosevelt nor Lewis realized the peril to which they were exposing both the unions and the country.
- Most people in this country believe that the American Communist Party and its dupes are the chief internal enemy of our economic system and our form of government. This is a serious mistake.
- But no one can praise Roosevelt for doing this and then insist that he restored our traditional political and economic systems to their former vitality.
- We seem to be a long way off from the kind of Fascism which we behold in Italy today, but we are not so far from the kind of Fascism which Mussolini preached in Italy before he assumed power, and we are slowly approaching the conditions which made Fascism there possible.

- The real peril of war lies not in military defeat. It lies in war itself, whether we win or lose.
- The only result of our present system - unless we reverse the drift - must be the gradual extension of the fascist sector and the gradual disappearance of the system of free enterprise under a free representative government.
- But Fascism cannot continue in a modified form.
- They do not say Roosevelt saved our system. They say he has given us a new one. That is logical.
- This most dangerous enemy is the American counterpart of the British Fabian Socialist, who denies that he is a Socialist and operates behind a mask which he calls National Planning.
- Fascism is not the result of dictatorship.
- All that is needed to set us definitely on the road to a Fascist society is war. It will of course be a modified form of Fascism at first.
- Fascism will come at the hands of perfectly authentic Americans.
- These code authorities could regulate production, quantities, qualities, prices, distribution methods, etc., under the supervision of the NRA. This was fascism.
- At the end of all this, Russia held in her hands a vast belt of land running from the Baltic sea in the north to the Black Sea in the south, comprising eleven nations with a population of 100 million people.
