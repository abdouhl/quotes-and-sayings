- I was staring at a wall of photos and thought, 'What would that sound like if it was music?' And I guess that was the kicker. That's what got me going.
- Music comes from a whole different place. It tells the story of your life and it's probably the closest thing I have to a religion.
- People wanted to know where I was and what I was doing. Was I still recording? Was I touring? Was I putting a band together? Was I writing songs? Was I even still singing?

- I realized I didn't want to make another solo record and I would be happier doing something that had more of a gang feel to it, more of a band thing.
- But I'll never write another Missing You' again as long as I live. I hope that I'll write a good song, but I don't think that I'll be able to write another song that will reach people that much.

- I am the same man writing the music. I haven't changed directions to suit anyone except me.

- I love country music, and I did as a kid.
- When you're up there acoustically you're thinking, How could I possibly go back to rock?' Then when I'm playing rock I think, How can I ever go back to being unplugged?' That's what makes it fun all of the time.

- When we're out touring, we often go to clubs to see people play. The alternative is to go back to the hotel And that's no good.

- I booked time in Philly Sound, which is an old church in south Philly that has a studio to the side of it that holds about 350 people. On the radio, we announced a free gig, bought about three kegs of beer. That got the audience slightly off of their legs, and we rocked the house.

- The silence of the room is as important as the music.
- When I think of a song, I think of it as a beast. You chase these beasts around the room and try to grab them and put them in a tape machine. But they're slippery, and they run away a lot.
- After Bad English, I made three albums back-to-back that I still think is my best work, but it wasn't meant to be toured.
- When you're playing rock music to 10,000 people, you almost attack the audience. When you play acoustic you're waiting for the audience to respond. It's a reverse energy, and you're more vulnerable. It's really intense.
