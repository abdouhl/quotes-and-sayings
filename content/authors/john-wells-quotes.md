- You have to have wonderful actors for material, particularly difficult material that requires complicated performances.

- Producing small films, you usually have four or five people you want, and you hope one of them will say they'll do it.
- I was a directing student and a production design student at Carnegie Mellon. I went in as a production design student and became a directing student.
- I love writing, and I love the solitude of the writing, in that you're just sitting there creating something from nothing, or a new story for characters you love and care about.
- As an adult, you think of yourself as being someone else when you're away from your family, but when you come back to your family, you suddenly find yourself back in the exact same role that you always had in your family as a child and as a teenager.
