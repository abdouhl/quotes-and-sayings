- If I had been in the gallery, I'd have gone home.
- I usually listen to my gut, so to speak, and my wife.
- People need to know that when I was interviewed when I played, I would really pat myself on the back when I did well and tell you how good I was playing, but I'd also tell you when I choked or I was playing terrible. I told it like it was.

- I remember, when I won at Tucson by nine shots in 1975, I would say the average iron shot I hit that week was no more than two feet off line. It was unbelievable.
- I don't want to brag, but I do more homework on the course than any other announcer. I chart the greens to get all the breaks. I walk down into the greenside bunkers. I walk into the fairway bunkers to see whether a player can reach the green from them.

- I grew up in an era where the perfect drive was a line drive, with quite a bit more spin.

- Tiger's swing when he won the Masters by 12 shots - I loved that swing.

- For me, 'choking' is just another term in golf.
