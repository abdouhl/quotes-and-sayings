- John 5 - he's weird. He's a freak. I'm just kidding. He's a great guy.
- Some people would do anything just to get a break; that's where the bad guys get you.
- I think people relate to Skynyrd; it's a working class band. They're just songs with messages. To this day, there's never been a song written that didn't have a message.
- We have fans that come up all the time and say, 'This song helped me through this tough time in my life' or whatever. The music helps us through it, too.
- Look at Montgomery Gentry. If those boys came out in the '70s, they'd be Southern rock.
- I like George W. At a time when this country was hit hard, he stood up for America. He's been the leader of the free world during the hardest time America's ever had.

- I want to be there for the last note of 'Freebird' when that happens.

- Who knows what the heck the future will bring.
- Don't sign your publishing away.

- We go to Europe, and they think we're totally prejudiced 'cause we hang the bars and stripes. But for us, the bars and stripes doesn't mean we want to see anybody in slavery or anything like that. It's just our heritage. To us, the bars and stripes means grits, 'y'all,' and the beauty of the South. There's no prejudice at all in that with us.
