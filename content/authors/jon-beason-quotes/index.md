- I would cry after losses when I was a kid and pout. But I played like that.
- You realize that you can't win 'em all. You try to win 'em all; you get frustrated, but you gotta have a short fuse either way. Success in the NFL is just as deadly as allowing yourself to kinda wallow in sorrow. It works both ways.
- Anytime you do anything, you want to know who was the best at it.
- I really want to do everything I can to try to win a game or win on a play. You get fiery; you get chippy out there, but a lot of respect, I never have anybody, like, talk trash in my career in the league, or I don't talk trash. I think guys respect the fact that I'm coming.
- I still love the preparation of the game. I think that actually helps you heal faster, still being around it; it keeps you motivated. It keeps you engaged, and I want to be around my teammates.
- I want people to perceive me as a guy who wants it. That I play the game with passion and desire. That I'm athletic, that I'm fast, and I'm relentless.
- You look at stats for a guy who is a pretty good linebacker, he'll make 100 tackles. You make 100, you're averaging seven or eight tackles a game. If you play every down, that's a good number.
