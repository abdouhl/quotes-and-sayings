- As a rule, I think people in L.A. are interested in any writer who brings a different skill set and experiences. There's an attraction to novelty and to anyone whose writing isn't based in screenwriting. I had that novelty.
- The one thing I didn't want to do was a show about the White House. I was too close to it.
- You look at what animates Democratic voters; you look at what animates Democratic politicians: it's health care. It's increasingly climate. It is wages and economic issues. It's issues around reproductive freedom and criminal justice reform and inequality.
- When in doubt, mock the powerful, not the powerless.
- '1600 Penn' was a hit. It's 2018. Anything you want can be true.

- It's always been a dream of mine to write comedy and be creative.

- We need people to point out groupthink - We need people to point out stale, old, dumb thinking - and we sometimes need to do that when it's considered dangerous, strange, or, by some, offensive. And we should be, all of us, trying to protect that. It's really important.
- I personally believe that Donald Trump being elected president is a national emergency and a crisis that stems from a great cascade of failures.
- Whenever you're talking about using humor in politics or in a policy speech or in a serious moment, you're talking about using it as a tool to engage people. That's why putting a joke in a political speech is a luxury, and it is always a risk.
- I'm not insulting Trump supporters; I'm calling the people that CNN puts on television terrible representatives of the views of conservatives.
- I'll always cringe remembering those little embarrassing moments when I said something dumb on a conference call, when my inexperience poked through, when I should have been more solicitous of the judgment of those around me. They're a reminder that it's not mutually exclusive to be confident and humble, to be skeptical and eager to learn.

- Washington is filled with people making other people's arguments for money.
- It's certainly true that presidents have confidantes who rise above what you would call just staff.
- They're the last human beings susceptible to human shame. Politicians are the only people left for whom, occasionally, shame hurts them. Everyone else, we've sort of done away with it as a concept, and we're hurtling through space like animals, basically.
- I spent three years working at the White House and wanted to do something that wasn't about passing bills and resolutions.
- People say that making money in the content-media game is hard, and that is just, like, not my experience. It's super-confusing, 'cause everyone's like, 'Oh, how are you going to monetize?' It's easy: just start talking, and then money rolls in.
- I'm motivated by a bottomless well of anger. It's a joke, but I don't think I don't mean it.
- Little things had to go wrong for Donald Trump to become president: Comey, emails, all that stuff. Big things did make Trump possible. Big, cultural, political, economic forces opened the door to someone like Trump.
- We've been dealing with censorship around multimedia, about multinational companies and the content they create, for a very long time.
- I don't know the venture fund terms. I don't know what a seed round is. I want nothing to do with it.
- We are drowning in partisan rhetoric that is just true enough not to be a lie; in industry-sponsored research; in social media's imitation of human connection; in legalese and corporate double-speak.
- A great speech can make you remember something about what you believe, about who you are, about who you want to be. It's rare when that kind of thing happens. But it is important, and it is real.
- Humor connects us, especially in politics. It's a way of surprising one another with shared context and experience.
- I will never apologize for selective editing to make myself look better.
- I don't live in the city of L.A. I live in West Hollywood.

It needs a voice that says we are imperfect, that life is complex, that government can create need even as it meets need, that you can't fix everything, and freedom is worth some danger and sorrow.
- The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function. That's what you have to do: you have to be confident in your potential and aware of your inexperience.
- Barack Obama took office in the middle of a massive financial crisis. He was handed a bunch of messes all around the world and at home.

- I'm famously humble.
- Humor is a way of saying we're all seeing the same ridiculous, absurd, infuriating things together.
- Everybody hates Congress; even Congress hates Congress.
- Nationalism is not that hard. It's not that hard to incite people against another, and it's also - and this is the harder thing: Democrats have, and the challenge we have all the time, is we believe in governing and governance and trying to find middle ground.
- It's a reasonable thing to tell somebody, 'I've watched 70 hours of 'Game of Thrones.'' That's a totally normal, boring thing to say about yourself. But if you were like, 'I just spent 100 hours playing 'Skyrim,'' people think you're a weirdo.

- I went into politics for the reasons most people do: ambition, self-righteousness, and a desire to help others.
- Republicans paint everything that Democrats have been for as socialism, too far to the left, as extreme, and it didn't matter how moderated it was; it didn't matter that Obamacare started out as a compromise. You might as well say what you're actually for and show what you really are.

- A boring speech can be just a boring speech. But a speech with a joke that falls flat is awful. I hate it. That's why I think it's easier to hate a comedy. If a drama doesn't land, it's boring; if a joke doesn't land - you hate that.
- 'The West Wing' was an incredible, inspiring show - and one of the reasons I wanted to be a speechwriter.
- When I was a kid, all I knew about Michael Jackson was that he was crazy. He had a monkey named Bubbles and some kind of oxygen chamber, and he used to be black, but he made himself white, and he was nuts. That was Michael Jackson in full. Wacko Jacko.

- Life tests our willingness, in ways large and small, to tell the truth.
- We have a lot of really boring, silly, stupid politics. We need people to point that out.
- It was awesome how supportive the White House was. It meant a lot to me that when I left, the people that I worked with - Jon Favreau and David Axelrod and others - really understood that this was something that I felt I held had to do.
- When a joke works, it works. It can make a point in a really simple way; it can be a great little sound bite to put on television or share on social media.

- I had never really planned on being a speechwriter.
- We are drowning in information.
