- I was a teacher for a long time. I taught at a community college: voice, theory, humanities. And nowadays, music education is a dying thing. Funding is being cut more and more and more.
- Oh, yeah, I've always thought of covering some of my influences like Billy Joel, Elton John, Stevie Wonder.
- A real active music set, based and really concentrated on what the music's all about. That's what I'm all about - singing and a really good strong music set.
- I'm a big believer in education, period.
- And my career, the things that have happened have happened because of my music education background.
- My intention when I came into this industry was to be a musician, not necessarily a recording artist, just a musician in general. And that's the reason I went to college and got my degree, which has been great for me. It's helped me a lot with my career.
- And for me, it's been, not only where I learned, but the people that I met there. Most of the people that I work with are guys that, one way or another, have been associated with the university.
- I just lived it and did my own thing without looking over my shoulder. I think I'm very lucky, considering when I started everything, and the fact that I have a masters in music, and I've always worked in music, and that's what I wanted to do.
- It happened in Miami, in Coral Gables, a great big ol' Cuban wedding. It was pretty intense.
- If you write songs and if you write music that's very sincere and very honest, it's pop music, but it is pop music with a lot of honesty and a lot of heart.
- Well, I always wanted to be educated and be prepared.
- So, when I got the contract for my album, even though it was an English record, my manager insisted on making sure we would record in Spanish as well, and it worked out really well for me.
- This record has a lot of influences that I'd love to cover, like Marvin Gaye and Earth, Wind and Fire. Maybe I'll do some covers of my major influences during my live show.
- I grew up in a community that was bilingual. I've done it for a while, singing in both languages.
- There's something about prime time television and the way the song is going to come off on the air. I'm very concerned, very self-conscious about that.
- For me, there's still a lot of room to grow; I'm just happy that I have so much more to give.
- With this new album, I prepared for it a long time, and I was happy with the songs and the production. I felt that I proved myself with the first album, and with this new album, I just want to share some of my music. And that was always my feeling and my intention.
- If there was any other place I would live, other than Miami, it would be California. It's beautiful. The weather is just gorgeous, I love being here, too.
- I have a bachelor's and a master's in jazz.
- There's always something about the Tonight Show that makes me a little bit anxious, nervous, excited. But it's good. It's good. It's been real good for me. It always has helped my career and Jay and all the people here have always been great.
- I might be a Cuban American, but I'm also an Afro-Cuban American.
- My style is a very universal sound, which is very close to where I grew up.
- I started in high school to be interested in music and from there, I decided to study in college. Yeah, you're right, I did start late, but luckily, because of my schooling, I picked up a lot of ground pretty quick.
- I grew up speaking both languages, and for me that's really important.
- For me, I can only do that from my own experience with people I've known and things that I've lived and experienced. That's what good pop music is all about, pop music that does reach out to people. It's very personalized and very real, honest and sincere.
- Having a college degree gave me the opportunity to be... well-rounded. Also, the people I met at the university, most of them are still my colleagues now. People I've known for years are all in the industry together.
