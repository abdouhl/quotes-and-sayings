- I was helping my mom grind meat at our butcher shop, and it just hypnotized me. I don't remember sticking my hand in, but it sheared off the three middle fingers and left me with a pinkie and a thumb.
- It brings me back to reality. The combine doesn't care if you're a senator or not. It breaks down whenever it wants to break down.
- If people really want to sit down and visit and talk about things like health care, which is a very, very important issue in Montana, I think oftentimes you want to get to the same goal. And that is affordable health care costs.
- If I was the leader of the House of Representatives, the first thing I would do is I would put in a very clean bill on reapportionment. And I would put a very clean bill in that says that corporations are not people.
- I served on a lot of the local boards in my local community, and then I ran for the state legislature in '98 and ran for the U.S. Senate in 2006. I mean, it was just kind of one thing after another. A series of really bad decisions.
- A well-trained workforce is critical to small-business success. What I hear from business is that it's hard to find help that meets their needs.

- The truth is that nobody agrees with anybody 100 percent of the time.
- I don't know how the other senators see me. I hope they see me as a farmer. That's really what I am. But I don't think they see me on a tractor or fixing equipment. I hope they see me grounded, as somebody who has common sense.
- I think there is some real therapy in getting your hands in the dirt and working with food.
- I go everywhere in the state and I listen to Montanans, whether it's in conservative areas or liberal areas, and take those ideas back to Washington, D.C., and put them into action.
- That's politics. Your friend one day is your enemy the next and vice versa.

- I think all politicians have gotten out of touch.
- If I made decisions around here based on the election, I wouldn't be a very good senator.

- I play trumpet. And I took all the music courses in college, so I can also play the string instruments, keyboard, the brass and woodwinds - but only well enough to teach them. If you put a violin in front of me, you wouldn't say, 'My God, that guy can play.' It'd probably sound more like Jack Benny.
- I will tell you, in the case of education, you have to make the investment if you're going to get the return. There's no doubt about that. It's a proven fact the return is there if you make the investment. It really is about priorities.
- I'm a farmer. I always will be a farmer. When I die, I'll be a farmer. It's something that I've wanted to do since I was 8 years old. I can tell you also that I see opportunity slipping away for our kids.

- When I have to do what I think is right for Montana, I do it.

- I have great faith in the people of Montana; they can't be bought.
- Building houses and mansion ranching is not ranching.
- I would love to tell you this country is on the cusp of coming together, but it isn't. But I can tell you that we need to work together in this country. We need to hold people accountable for their actions, and that will be done. And we need to move forward in a way that we have the strongest middle class ever.
- I think one thing that Montanans all agree on, whether you're Republican or Democrat, is they want money spent appropriately.
- You've got to have a good public education system so small-business owners, when they locate to an area, are confident their kids are getting the best education possible. I feel strongly about local control in school districts.

- I really think that people's right to happiness shouldn't be dictated by some policymaker in Washington, D.C.

- I think if you're going to get anything done in the Senate, you have to be on the same sheet of music. If you don't get people on the same sheet of music it comes out pretty horrible.

- I think difference of opinion is a good thing.
- Montanans know who I am: They know I'm a lifetime Montanan. They know I understand rural America. They know I understand public lands and not privatizing them. They know I understand the importance of public education.
- Donald Trump was straight up. I mean, he told me what he thought of me, and that's cool. I might not like it, but at least he did it to my face. That's what Montanans like. They like people to be square with them.
