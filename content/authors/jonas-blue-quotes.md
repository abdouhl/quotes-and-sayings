- There's benefits of having established artists on the record, Liam Payne on 'Polaroid' for example. If you look at that song you have Lennon Stella, who's an up-and-coming artist, so there's a balance on there because I still want people to focus on the song just as much as Liam being an amazing superstar.

- I'm a little bit of a show-off; I just wanted to get girls and be popular.
- Albums are great but for an artist like me, I don't think albums are the way to go.
- I think some people have this thing where just because you do singles that means you're not a real artist. It's like hold on a minute - I'm selling millions of records here and been streamed billions of times... How can I not be taken as a real artist just because these songs are singles?
- I'm always up for collaborating with people who are slightly leftfield.
- I come from a songwriter background, so essentially with my music, I'm trying to make songs that will last a lifetime and although 'Fast Car' was a cover, it reflects what I'm trying to do.

- I think when 'Perfect Strangers' landed and was so well received, it was a magic moment.

- I got into DJing because that was the coolest thing to do and I've never looked back.
- I've always wanted to collaborate with Shawn Mendes, he's an amazing artist, but the thing with Shawn is that I won't collaborate... me just sending some beats. It has to be in the studio where we'd both be there recording together.

- Before I hit any country I always do my research. I look at what's on the chart there, what's worked in the last few years. As a deejay, as a producer, that's when I get editing. I bring my own edits of tracks that are really cool and happening out there.

- My mates are absolute nutters. They're all Essex boys in the true sense and they definitely keep my feet on the ground.
- DJs are the new rock stars.
- I like releasing singles because I can get them out there quickly and it's based on the changes, the sounds that are going on all around the world that I'm hearing and just a whole different bunch of influences which is sometimes hard to get across on an album because it can take a few months or a year to come along.
- I prank my manager. I tell him I've lost my passport, or I've lost my case, or I hide his case. He is so gullible, he is the most gullible person ever.

- I've always worked from a young age and was never big on drinking or smoking, so whatever money I had I put into synths.
- People like Sam Smith and Adele, they're album artists but for me, where I go around the world and sounds are changing so quickly, singles are the best way to get those influences out there and try new things out.
- People like Little Mix... they've got a big lot of choreography that they need to do so it's difficult to sing and dance at the same time. I think if they've got to do a big performance with loads of visuals behind, they need to possibly mime at some point.
- I hate mess. I have the worst OCD so I'm not a hoarder of clothes.
- I don't drink or party. There's literally no time for that. As soon as I finish a show, I go straight back to the hotel room, do emails, I sleep, that's it.
- Especially when I finish one of my songs I play it to my friends who are just normal people and not people in the music business.
- A mixer for me needs to have some sort of effects, as it's a big part of how I might hype up the crowd in certain parts of a track, using the delays and filters for instance.

- If I'm honest, I never knew 'Fast Car' was going to be my first single.
- I've never had that boring office job. All my jobs were music related.
- Obviously the music I listened to growing up helped create my musical pallet. My parents were into pop, soul, disco, RNB, Latin, jazz and Middle Eastern music.
- To be honest, I'm like a sponge so my inspiration and influences really can come from anywhere.
- I find in America, actually, I actually prefer it because it's all about energy. It's all about making everyone feel happy and smiling. In the U.K. sometimes people are a bit too concerned about, 'Did you play that track? Did you play that track?' It's not so much about the music in the U.K.
- I used to follow artistes like David Guetta and Swedish House Mafia a lot before making a full fledged career in EDM... their music inspired me too much.
