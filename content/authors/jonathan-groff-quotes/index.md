- Whenever you get into a new environment, it's scary. You don't know the people; you're not really comfortable with the machine that the show is.
- I grew up in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, watching the Tony Awards on TV. Not just 'watching' the Tony Awards on TV - I would record them on a VHS tape and bring them in to school and show them to the other kids.
- When I was doing 'Spring Awakening' the first couple of years I was living in New York, I was gay, and I was living with my 'roommate,' who was my boyfriend but was my roommate to everyone else.

- I remember telling my mom, 'Mom, I'm gay, but I'm not going to march in a parade or anything.' That's what I was telling my parents and all my friends and everything. I'm gay, but I'm not going to be on a float or something. Cut to five years later, and I was the grand marshal of the gay pride parade.
- I got cast for 'Spring Awakening' when I was 20. Every dream I had came true in that moment.

- I'm not on Twitter. I'm not on Facebook. I'm not on Instagram.
- I just don't know artistically - because I don't write my own music - I don't know artistically what an album would mean for me. I don't know what I would want to say with an album that would be unique to me - something that hasn't been done before. I'm just not sure what that is. But I'm absolutely open to it.
- Before 'Mindhunter,' I was doing this show called 'Looking' on HBO.
- I loved 'Weekend,' and it meant a lot to me when I saw it in the movie theater. I think 'Looking' feels more like that movie than any of those other shows, with a little more comedy thrown in than 'Weekend.' But it's certainly got the vibe and look and feeling of that movie.
- Once I came out of the closet, it was sort of that thing of 'The truth will set you free.'

- I was playing this character, Melchior Gabor, who was a rebel and who was a person who didn't let the world define him, and who stood up to authority and was this kind of revolutionary... And when I left 'Spring Awakening,' I came out of that experience feeling like... I had cultivated this side of my personality that hadn't existed before.

- I never look at myself online, and I don't read gossip Web sites.
- I did have AOL Instant Messenger when I was in middle school.
- I'd moved to New York to pursue a career in theatre, and it's very practical how you do it - I just went to every open call going.

- The hardest I've ever laughed was with Lea Michele.
- I love going to the movies.
- While I was in high school, I saw Sutton Foster in 'Thoroughly Modern Millie,' and she was the one that was most inspiring to me for sure. I saw 'Millie' 6 times in a span of two years or so.

- When I was a senior in high school, I worked at a theater where they hired New York actors. And they told me about 'Backstage,' and so I got my school in Pennsylvania to subscribe. And there was an audition for a tour of 'The Sound of Music,' and I got the job. Deferred my admission to college just to go on tour.
- Even the first suitcase-off-the-train moment, it's easy to be discouraged, frustrated, annoyed, angry.

Pierrepont Finch in 'How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying' in high school.'

- We didn't have a glee club at my school. It depends on what area of the States you're from. It's more in the Midwest.

- In the first year in New York, I went to this amazing teacher named Jen Waldman. She does lots of different classes, but one of her classes was where you went and worked on a song.

- I was Mary Poppins for Halloween when I was 3, with lipstick and a carpetbag. And I was Dorothy in 'The Wizard of Oz' in a production in my dad's barn.
- Some people have the gift where they can just sing. I don't have the fail-safe voice, so it has to be something that I need to sing about.
- I think the first Broadway show that I saw was 'Beauty and the Beast,' and that was in 5th or 6th grade. Our school would take bus trips up to see shows, and so it was on one of their bus trips that I got to see 'Beauty and the Beast.'

- My first film that I got right after 'Spring Awakening' was called 'Taking Woodstock,' and Ang Lee was the director.
- I believe in 'Backstage.' It changed my life.
- The difference between being in the closet and out of the closet as a gay man is such a huge shift. I feel so connected still to that 22-year-old, but the idea that I was not open with that part of my life - which I am now so open about - is sort of surreal.
- I'm a singer who moves well.

- I can't think of a better bonding experience than to be able to sit on stage and to watch your fellow performers perform on stage every night.
- I loved traditional musical comedy. That was my passion. Then 'Spring Awakening' happened, and it took that rock n' roll and pop music to change gears for me.
- When you get to really involve yourself with a piece and the other people, and you get to feel like it's a community and you're all building something together, it helps me to produce better work, I think.

- I feel like loyalty is such a rare quality in this world, particularly the entertainment world.
- I wanted to work with Michael Mayer because I'd seen 'Thoroughly Modern Millie' six times.
- I was journaling in Florence, and I was like, 'Oh, I have to come out of the closet. I have to break up with this guy' - he was my 'roommate.' So that was my awakening moment, when I stepped into my own skin while in a foreign country by myself and had a very stereotypical moment of revelation.
- The first job I got was a production of 'Fame - the Musical,' at the North Shore Music Theatre in Beverly, Massachusetts, and it got me my Equity card, too. I waited 12 hours to be seen for it, though!

- It's one thing to experience your Broadway debut alone, but to share it with an entire company was like summer camp or a college experience, where you were really growing up together.
- It's so awesome to be a part of something that is successful not because there's a famous person in it or because it's a revival of something, but because it's so fresh and original.
