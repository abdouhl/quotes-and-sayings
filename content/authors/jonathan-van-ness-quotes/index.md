- I'm really about body positivity and self-love, and I will definitely push the boundary with a pink midriff-baring top.
- For keeping hair long and healthy, I like to use silk pillowcases; they conduct less heat and keep your ends less frayed. Also, I sleep with my hair in a very loose top bun to keep my ends away from my body heat. This also keeps your hair from getting tangled at the nape of your neck.
- In yoga, we say that everyone has a magnet on them, and you're either positively or negatively charged. So if you're liking how you're looking, you're gonna be more positively charged.
- Leaving your hair down to sleep causes friction on your ends between your body heat and the pillow case. Securing the ends away from your body helps preserve your ends.

- The second you're bleaching hair more than three or four levels on a consistent basis and want it long, and then you're heat styling it and living in the world - it's just impossible. You can get it there for a moment, and then you might get a couple re-touches out of it.

- I'm a big proponent of all love winning and love just being fab.
- You want to be more hairy, that's beautiful. You want to be more clean-shaven, that's great.
- I'm just waiting for the first #MeToo moment to happen from a salon because the culture of how assistants are treated, especially in salons in L.A. and New York, is, like, truly unbelievable. You're expected to clock out for lunch and never get paid. You're expected to be there an hour early, stay two hours late.
- If my energy was fake, then I would feel pressured, because I gotta, like, keep this up. I thank God it's just how I am. But I find myself wanting to work on being more comfortable in the silence with people.

- My family was really big on college, and it was hard for them to stomach that I was going to be a hairdresser.

- I think that the ideal of men's physiques in general, gay or straight, is one of the most under-talked-about things ever. Ninety-five percent of these bodies that we're seeing, that we're striving so hard to look like, are genetically engineered - like, let's be very clear.

- I remember saying I wanted to be a cosmetologist when I was really young.

- I used to be pretty hard on myself, like, if I didn't like a haircut I did on someone, I would think about it a lot and second-guess myself. But after therapy and a lot of work, I know how to dust myself off a lot faster, and those things don't knock me down as much as they used to.
- You gotta floss!
- In service industries, we can be so people-pleaser-y that you don't know how to set your own boundaries.
