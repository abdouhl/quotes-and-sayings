- Ryder Cup, Presidents Cup, whatever it may be, is maybe the most fun couple weeks we have a year, but I love being able to control my own destiny. The work that I am able to put in ahead of time was either going to come out and I was going to be successful with it, or I was going to try and fail and learn how to succeed the next time.
- Without the AJGA, it would be very difficult for the college coaches to find us. Every junior golfer around the country knows about the AJGA and knows that's the way to get to college. And the way to get beyond college.
- The generation that I'm in is extremely talented, and those that are still in school, my peers that are my age that will be out here really soon, you guys will see, will make a pretty easy transition on the PGA Tour. I don't think they will have a problem at all. The game is getting younger, and the game is getting better.
- The game is getting younger and the game is getting better. It has to do with Tiger and Phil, largely, inspiring everybody and brought a lot more youth into the game of golf.
- I don't think people can watch University of Texas basketball or football games with me - really, anything Texas is playing - without wanting to punch me in the face. I'm as big a Longhorn fan as you'll find.
- You have to think of them as your peers. You can't really - when you're on the course and looking up to anybody, you're saying, 'Wow, that's so and so,' that's when you get into trouble. For instance, if you're paired with them, then what do you do?
- Michael Jordan and Michael Phelps are the greatest to ever do what they did, and I'm not. But if you believe that you are, then you're almost as good as being that.
- I have a lot of confidence in my game. I love to play with confidence, be aggressive, and that's just how I've always done it.
- Golf, to its foundation, is a game of integrity and one that encourages us to give back, kind of be ambassadors, role models, I guess, for kids - whether they like golf or not.
- I was a pitcher, and my dad played in college. The hardest day of my life was telling him I was going to quit to focus more on golf. But with golf, I felt like the game can't be perfected, and that motivated me.
- Whenever the heat's on, my whole life, I've just kind of learned to focus a little more.
- A lot of weekend players struggle with putting because they have too much tension in their hands and arms, both at address and during the stroke. Tension can turn a technically perfect motion into a herky-jerky mess, especially on those knee-knockers.
- Having inched closer and accomplished some of my major goals in the sport of golf, no pun intended, why not work as hard as I can to attain those goals if I'm already feeling like I'm playing well and getting more and more comfortable.
- Every tournament I go to, I'm kind of learning a little bit mentally and on the course.
- Look at the putt from behind the hole. Everyday players almost never do this. They should! Your eyes will take in more information about the slope. Sometimes you'll find that your initial read was incorrect.
- PGA of America has been very good to me; played some of the Junior Ryder Cups, and those go down as some of the best experiences I've had on a golf course.
- I have started up the Jordan Spieth Family Foundation. My little sister has special needs, so I started out trying to help kids with special needs. We have moved on to military now and a third pillar in junior golf, trying to help grow it back home.
- To be able to have winning in your blood growing up, whether it was pounding my little brother or trying to beat my dad in something, or just competing on teams with my friends, it was nonstop.
- Under Armour is new, aggressive, slick, classic but athletic - kind of how I always wanted to be perceived.
- I've got four pairs of cowboy boots.
- I've told myself I have a chance to make history, and that's my focus.
- In greenside bunkers, the big thing is to adapt your stance to the shot. It's rare that you get a flat lie in the sand, so I make sure to align my body to the slope. Then I blast the ball out by splashing the sand underneath it.
- My only focus after I start the putter away from the ball is keeping the back of my left wrist as fat as possible from start to finish. This is critical to keeping the putterhead and ball moving straight down the target line after impact. It's also how Rory Mcllroy squares his putterface, and obviously it works for him.
- Stats are important to me, especially the ones related to scoring. You're going to miss fairways and greens out here, so how you play from the sand really matters.
- If you are going to talk negative about a place, you're almost throwing yourself out to begin with because golf is a mental game.
