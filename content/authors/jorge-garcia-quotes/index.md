- That's always a cool thing to be the voice of what the eyes are seeing. It gives you the role of the Greek chorus and that's always fun to do.
- Life is very nice in Hawaii. I rent a place that has its own cottage so when my friends and family come to visit, they have somewhere nice to stay.
- I definitely try to mix humour into anything I do, even if it is into a drama.
- I used to work at this store called Music Plus in San Clemente, California, when I was growing up, and then they became Blockbuster Music, and, like, you had to get a haircut to work there, and at the time I had some pretty long hair. So after that policy was imposed, I knew that was going to be my last summer working there.
- I have been sent three or four scripts for television series, but there wasn't anything I really wanted to do. I want to tell a good story, whether it's a TV show, a movie, whatever. That's really my No. 1 criteria.
- People don't really want to know what happens. They ask you for just a second, but then they don't want to know.
- JJ Abrams is definitely a guy that when he calls, you want to answer. He's incredibly focused. When he was shooting the pilot on 'Lost,' we'd do a take and he'd go back to his tent and be working on the first episodes of 'Lost' as well as the cliffhanger for the eighth season of 'Alias.' He's an incredible multitasker.
- Mixing humour and harsh reality is a very human behaviour, it's the way people stay sane in their daily lives.
- I just enjoy the ride while I have it.
- I'm perfectly happy doing nothing. I'll hang around the house and take the dog to the park.
- I have gotten used to working in the dark and I dig it.
- You can get fired from any job at any time.
- There's certainly pressure to find your audience early. You need to paint the picture, but it's tough trying to find the balance between a show that people can tune in on any given week while still grabbing the people who are there every week.
- Bad people are intriguing!
