- I don't want any up-and-coming guys. I want someone that's established already, that's good.
- I used to be a 55er, Conor used to be a 45er. I'm naturally a 70 pounder, Conor's probably a natural 55er. I'm a small 70 pounder though and Conor's a decent-sized 55er so the size is not that much. It's not incomparable.
- Nobody has ever wanted - they get forced to fight Yoel. Ask anybody.
- I think the sport is growing and along with it weight classes have to be added.
- If you look through my career, I put an end to a lot of guys never been knocked down, never been stopped.
- My body of work speaks for itself.
- I'm not Ben Askren or a lot of these fighters. I've never called a reporter like, hey, I want to be on your show, book me, you know?
- Man, I never got to fight a ranked opponent at 155, and that wasn't because I wasn't winning.
- When you're up-and-coming in your career, yes, maybe you have to dodge certain guys. 'Hey, my wrestling isn't good yet, let me get it on-point and then I'll come back there,' or, 'I'm not going to fight that guy right now,' because whatever, when you're up-and-coming. But once you're already at the top of your game, you're in there, man. That's it.

- At any given moment, if I see my bully, the guy who's trying to conquer me, we're going to find out. And if we could fight every time we came across each other, we would.

- Askren is that dude I'm not losing in any universe to.
- I always cheer for my MMA brothers and sisters.
- Over everything, over friendships or anything, is my kids - and obviously fighting for that belt is my kids' future. It doesn't sound too nice, but if my mom had the belt, she better give it up because my kids gotta eat. If I'm willing to fight my mom, imagine a good friend.
- I want to fight the guys that are world-class beaters. That's who I want to get in there with.
- I'm a dirty south goon - damn right, I ain't no West coast gangster.

- That's the biggest act of cowardice, faking injuries.
- I'm a guy who's in there everyday with world-class grapplers feeling that pressure.

- My body fat at 173 is five percent, so the rest is just straight water that I lose.
- I can't stay stuck in the past.
- I do not want to fight Woodley because we're cool. We've worked out so much together, and he's looked out for me in the past with certain hookups that he had at the time. So I don't want to fight that dude.
- The bigger the fight, the better.
- I'm not a sock-em, rock-em type of guy.
- I don't come from this technology world.
- My coaches know when it's a big fight, I'm at the gym because if they give me some pretender, another actor, I might not take it.
- My job is to hit somebody until the referee pulls me off.
- A fight is usually longer than five seconds.
- In every fight the strategy is to baptize and take their soul - that's always the strategy.
- I got kicked out of school... I caused a lot of turbulence throughout those years.
- I get along just fine with Woodley. He's actually showed me a lot things in the past, and I've worked with him in the past training to help him get ready to fight. There's no hard feelings if me and hit had to scrap.
- I just want to fight the best guys that there is in the world and make the most money out of it.
- I thought me hitting you and you not hitting me and me making you miss and even throwing more than you means that I won a fight.
- If it was... let's say they just banned 170, that it was either 55 or 85, I'd go to 185 before I'd go to 55.
- I don't go around making conversation, I just kind of stick to myself.
- I can box. I can hit hard. I've got different angles.
- I'm not involved in too many wars, where I'm just constantly getting hit, hit, hit.

- I've got more mat hours than most of the guys who are grapplers got on the mat.
- It's simple, I'm a fighter, but on top of that I have to entertain the people.
- Let me make this clear: I think USADA has moved my sport forward in certain ways that I couldn't have imagined.
- The more I tour the world, the more I see that people are just like me. They love violence.
- It's a blessing and a curse. I feel like I've gotta fight every dude that stepped foot on 'The Ultimate Fighter.'
- If they're not the toughest fights I can get, then give me a complete washup, someone that'll be an easy payday. But I'd rather have the toughest fights I can get so I can get to the title the fastest way possible.
- I was definitely done with 155, then when I heard they ended up banning IVs I was like, there's no way I can make 55.
- It's taken me 26 professional fights to seek out nutritional help and I finally did and it's made a big change in my weight as far as weight cutting goes.
- I want to put money away in the bank.
- I do a very strict diet.
- There's some people who violate that man-code of the gym.
- A lot of times I went to sleep hungry, and not because I was cutting weight for a fight.
- I feel like if they added a few weight classes it wouldn't change up the dynamics of the sport. You can still have champions and it wouldn't be like boxing. Boxing got messed up, because they've got so many belts, so many unifications. It's crazy.
- I asked for the toughest, best fights to my management, to my coaches.
- I never care about my opponents, especially now - I care about 'Gamebred' and 'Gamebred' is only going for the off button.
- I've been fighting professionally since I was 18, and I've been doing three or four fights a year, just doing camp after camp.
- I've never tapped in my whole entire career.
- I'm the type of guy if you say something right now, whenever I see you, I'm going to hold you to that.
- I just want to go out and compete. Plus the main thing is, at 55 I need a good amount of time to prepare just to make the weight cut. At 70 I can just take fights as they come and just compete as much as I want.
- You guys might not know who Yves Edwards is, if you don't, shame on you, go do some research.
- I've known Woodley for nine-plus years, ten-plus years. We've worked out together plenty. He's one of the guys who used to slam me all around the place. I was at 155, he was at 170 pounds and he was just the wrestler that is a superpower. So that was one of the dudes that got my wrestling a little better from going with guys like that.
- I could sit down and give USADA my opinions on it, but I want to say they've done a great job. Guys like me are shining because of USADA.
- I don't want to fight no up-and-coming guy, no guy that's 15-0 but hasn't faced anybody yet.
- I never think past any man, because every guy has two hands and every dude wants to hurt you.
- I want the biggest fight, no matter where it's at.

- Definitely the title, definitely Kamaru Usman interests me.
- This is a sport of a lot of knowledge, of knowing yourself well, knowing your soul and your spirit, your abilities both physically and mentally.
- I grew up in Miami, Florida.
- If I can compete five, six times a year that would be perfect.
- For some reason, that's the title they're giving me: ''The Ultimate Fighter' Destroyer.'

- I'm just not going around disrespecting people.
- Nobody is taking my lunch money.
- I want to get paid for my services.
- I'm a real fighter.
