- Today I'm committed to take care of your families like I've taken care of mine. I want to make Mexico the best country to live in.

- There are two ways of lying. One, not telling the truth and the other, making up statistics.
- I reiterate my proposal of creating life sentences for politicians who make deals with organized criminals. They deserve the maximum penalty because a politician that makes deals with criminals - I've said it, and I repeat it - is no longer a politician but just another 'capo.'
