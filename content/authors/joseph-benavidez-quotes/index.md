- My dream has always been to be a UFC champion. It wasn't to be a main event fighter.
- I've always believed I was going to win a world title.
- When the UFC announced that 125 tournament, I remember thinking, 'Finally, this is my spot.'
- I will always believe in the team aspect.
- The title's the goal, not to beat Henry Cejudo. Because I already accomplished that goal.
- One person I lost to at 135 was the champion at the time, Dominick Cruz.
- I wasn't fighting in this sport from the beginning for any other reason than being the best.

- I just need to remember even if I don't get the title, I have an awesome life and an awesome family and friends.
- The destination is the belt, but you never arrive at just the belt. You're always on the way to something else. You never truly arrive anywhere. But winning the belt, it's a nice pit stop.
- I wanted to fight Cejudo only because it meant I was gonna win the title. It wasn't about fighting a person.
- I was sitting in the nosebleeds eating hot dogs and watching Georges St. Pierre win the world title from Matt Hughes. Like never in my wildest dreams if someone would have tapped me on the shoulder and said, 'Hey, seven years from now you're going to be down there doing the same thing' would I have believed them.
- Fans are going to give you crap no matter what sexual orientation you are.
- All we have is our talent. That's what's great about the division, you can see things that 125-pound guys can do that some other guys can't. All we have is our skill.
- I never thought I was going to lose the first title fight. I was literally obsessed with the outcome only, and I couldn't imagine any other way possible. I thought I was going to explode and die before I lost. But I lost.
- I'm never not motivated to train.
- That's why we're here: to leave a legacy that'll be remembered long after we're done. And what a great start to my legacy, man, being the first UFC flyweight champion.
- I'm in this sport for a long time and I'm going to continue to fight with my whole heart and put on a show.
- Taking punches to the face at six in the morning, it's funny to hear that but, like, I'm grateful that I'm capable to do that.
- I've realized that I can't control what the hell everyone else is gonna do. People are crazy. People want different things.
- My wife... so grateful for that. Nothing can be bad - going home and having someone making you feel like the best every day.
- Some people, honestly, as simple as it sounds, aren't going to log in and put in all their information to get a fight on Fight Pass. I mean, they're just not going to do it.

- When I say I wasn't a 'meant to be' guy, I've almost been jaded in the sport, where I don't believe in anything.
- To me, the best part about winning the belt is hugging my wife after.
- I love crying. I pick movies to go see with the intention of crying.
- I remember this one time I had a dream about me writing a screenplay, and when I woke up, you know those dreams that feel so real, but I woke up and I was like, 'Oh my god I have this amazing screenplay I need to write down as soon as I wake up' and then I woke up and I was like what the heck was I dreaming of?

- Persevering is a fight. That's what a fight is. You face something, you persevere through it, you meet it head on.

- When you appreciate something and you're grateful for it - like going in to work everyday or just your partner or your job - you just do it that much better because you're lucky that you're doing it.
- Cejudo would be awesome. It would be an honor to go out and fight an Olympian.
