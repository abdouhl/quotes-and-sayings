- American poetry to me is a sort of relentless, nonstop sermon on human autonomy.
- After the last line of a poem, nothing follows except literary criticism.
- In terms of freedom, America doesn't invite any comparison to Russia. It would be silly to make one. Every line that I care to write, I can have printed. There is no point to even talk about degrees.

- The real history of consciousness starts with one's first lie.
- Time can be an enemy or a friend.
- I like the idea of isolation. I like the reality of it. You realize what you are... not that the knowledge is inevitably rewarding.

- I started to write when I was eighteen or nineteen. However, until I was about twenty-three, I didn't take it that seriously.
- The literature from which I come is rather large.
- Regardless of whether one is a writer or a reader, one's task consists first of all in mastering a life that is one's own, not imposed or prescribed from without, no matter how noble its appearance may be. For each of us is issued but one life, and we know full well how it all ends.
- A man is, after all, what he loves. But one always feels cornered when asked to explain why one loves this or that person, and what for. In order to explain it - which inevitably amounts to explaining oneself - one has to try to love the object of one's attention a little bit less.
- The real biographies of poets are like those of birds, almost identical - their data are in the way they sound. A poet's biography lies in his twists of language, in his meters, rhymes, and metaphors.
- It's a maddening thing in itself to look at an old poem of yours. To translate it is even more maddening.
- By writing... in the language of his society, a poet takes a large step toward it. It is society's job to meet him halfway, that is, to open his book and read it.
- One who writes a poem writes it because the language prompts, or simply dictates, the next line.
- The one who writes a poem writes it above all because verse writing is an extraordinary accelerator of conscience, of thinking, of comprehending the universe.
- Prison is essentially a shortage of space made up for by a surplus of time; to an inmate, both are palpable.

- My idea is simply - is very simple - is that the books of poetry should be published in far greater volume and be distributed in far greater volume, in far more substantial manner. You can sell in supermarkets very cheaply. In paperbacks. You can sell in drugstores.
- No matter how daring or cautious you may choose to be, in the course of your life, you are bound to come into direct physical contact with what's known as Evil. I mean here not a property of the gothic novel but, to say the least, a palpable social reality that you in no way can control.
- This assumption that the blue collar crowd is not supposed to read it, or a farmer in his overalls is not to read poetry, seems to be dangerous if not tragic.
- Writers seem mesmerized by the state - the temporal entity. The word 'perestroika' is impressed somehow on our minds. But that is not the duty of a writer.
- People who buy 'The National Enquirer' would buy poetry. They should be given a choice. I'm absolutely serious.
- The imprisoning of a writer is the same as the burning of a book.
- On the whole, books are indeed less finite than ourselves. Even the worst among them outlast their authors - mainly because they occupy a smaller amount of physical space than those who penned them. Often they sit on the shelves absorbing dust long after the writer himself has turned into a handful of dust.
- Nothing convinces an artist more of the arbitrariness of the means to which he resorts to attain a goal - however permanent it may be - than the creative process itself, the process of composition.

- Any dispute in matters of taste usually results in a standoff.
- By failing to read or listen to poets, society dooms itself to inferior modes of articulation: those of the politician, the salesman or the charlatan... In other words, it forfeits its own evolutionary potential.
- I had been imprisoned three times and had twice been incarcerated in a madhouse.
- Because civilizations are finite, in the life of each of them there comes a moment when the center ceases to hold. What keeps them at such times from disintegration is not legions but language.

- To translate poetry, one has to possess some art, at the very least the art of stylistic re-embodiment.
- I am neither an Occidental writer nor a Russian writer. I am an accidental writer.
- By and large, prisons are survivable, though hope is indeed what you need least upon entering here; a lump of sugar would be more useful.

- Evil is a sucker for solidity. It always goes for big numbers, for confident granite, for ideological purity, for drilled armies and balanced sheets.

- Poetry is rather an approach to things, to life, than it is typographical production.
- The concept of historical necessity is the product of rational thought and arrived in Russia by the Western route. The idea of the noble savage, of an inherently good human nature hampered by bad institutions, of the ideal state, of social justice and so forth - none of these originated or blossomed on the banks of the Volga.
- Bookstores should be located not only on campuses or on main drags, but at the assembly plant's gates, also.

- English is the only interesting thing that's left in my life.

- Bad literature is a form of treason.
- I am a patriot, but I must say that English poetry is the richest in the world.
- Americans have been tremendously fortunate in poetry, regarding both the quantity and quality of poetry produced. Unfortunately, it remains in schools and universities; it is not widely distributed.
- Poetry isn't just different from prose, it's more important for the human species.
- What makes art in general, and literature in particular, remarkable, what distinguishes them from life, is precisely that they abhor repetition. In everyday life, you can tell the same joke thrice and, thrice getting a laugh, become the life of the party. In art, though, this sort of conduct is called 'cliche.'
- Poetry seems to be the only weapon able to beat language, using language's own means.

- The blue-collar is not supposed to read Horace, nor the farmer in his overalls Montale or Marvell. Nor, for that matter, is the politician expected to know by heart Gerard Manley Hopkins or Elizabeth Bishop. This is dumb as well as dangerous.
- On the whole, infinity is a fairly palpable aspect of this business of publishing, if only because it extends a dead author's existence beyond the limits he envisioned, or provides a living author with a future he cannot measure. In other words, this business deals with the future which we all prefer to regard as unending.

- Cherish your human connections: your relationships with friends and family.
- Paperbacks of those we deem classics should be cheap and sold at supermarkets.

- An ethical man doesn't need a consensus of his allies in order to act against something he finds reprehensible.

- For the poet the credo or doctrine is not the point of arrival but is, on the contrary, the point of departure for the metaphysical journey.
- I'm the happiest combination you can think of. I'm a Russian poet, an English essayist, and a citizen of the United States.
- Life has a great deal up its sleeve.
- A writer is seldom satisfied with the condition he finds himself in. We're all given to fretting a lot.
- One belongs to one's language as a writer.
- I simply loved all my life; loved is too strong a word, but I had a tremendous sentiment, partly conditioned, of course, by the reality of where I grew up, for the spirit of individualism, for the idea of your being on your own in a big way.

- Prose is admittedly an art rooted in social intercourse, and a fiction writer is faster to find a common denominator with his cell mates than a poet is.
- Reduced... to a crude formula, the Russian tragedy is precisely the tragedy of a society in which literature turned out to be the prerogative of the minority.
- It would be enough for me to have the system of a jury of twelve versus the system of one judge as a basis for preferring the U.S. to the Soviet Union. I would prefer the country you can leave to the country you cannot.
- To put it in plain language, Russia is that country where the name of a writer appears not on the cover of his book, but on the door of his prison cell.
- The mechanics of love imply some sort of bridge between the sensual and the spiritual, sometimes to the point of deification; the notion of an afterlife is implicit not only in our couplings, but also in our separations.
- The charge frequently leveled against poetry - that it is difficult, obscure, hermetic and whatnot - indicates not the state of poetry but, frankly, the rung of the evolutionary ladder on which society is stuck.
- Of course there is no denying the possible pleasure of holing up with a fat, slow-moving, mediocre novel; still, we all know that we can indulge ourselves in that fashion only so much. In the end, we read not for reading's sake, but to learn.
- Literature invents its own rules.
- For a writer only one form of patriotism exists: his attitude toward language.
- If what distinguishes us from other species is speech, then poetry, which is the supreme linguistic operation, is our anthropological - indeed, genetic - goal.

- One always pulls the trigger out of self-interest and quotes history to avoid responsibility or pangs of conscience.
- Anyone who regards poetry as an entertainment, as a 'read,' commits an anthropological crime, in the first place against himself.
- Venice is eternity itself.
- Basically, it's hard for me to assess myself, a hardship not only prompted by the immodesty of the enterprise, but because one is not capable of assessing himself, let alone his work. However, if I were to summarize, my main interest is the nature of time. That's what interests me most of all. What time can do to a man.
- For boredom speaks the language of time, and it is to teach you the most valuable lesson of your life - the lesson of your utter insignificance.
- A person sets out to write a poem for a variety of reasons: to win the heart of his beloved; to express his attitude toward the reality surrounding him, be it a landscape or a state; to capture his state of mind at a given instant; to leave - as he thinks at that moment - a trace on the earth.
- American poetry is this country's greatest patrimony. It takes a stranger to see some things clearly. This is one of them, and I am that stranger.
- Man is what he reads.
- Beginning a poem, the poet as a rule doesn't know the way it's going to come out, and at times, he is very surprised by the way it turns out, since often it turns out better than he expected; often his thought carries further than he reckoned.
- A writer is a tool of the language rather than the other way around.
- Unlike life, a work of art never gets taken for granted: it is always viewed against its precursors and predecessors.
