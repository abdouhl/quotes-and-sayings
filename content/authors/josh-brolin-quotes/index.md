- It takes me 10 minutes to get ready to go out, and that includes the shower.
- I gotta make money - it all tends to disappear in this field.
- I got picked on a lot. I was a complete geek in school. I had braces. I didn't have the hot girlfriend. I wasn't ever sought after. I was a stocky, awkward kid who got laughed off the tennis court when I tried that.
- The only way change will ever happen is if we speak up, and we have to know that it actually has an impact. Because we have a lot more power than we think we do, I think.
- I only took a high school acting class because there was no other class I wanted to take. I loved it, but I was always against acting as a profession. I didn't like the monetary fluctuations I saw.
- 'W.' is not necessarily a political film, but it was sort of a contrasting reality for me to get into George W. Bush as a character because of how I felt about his administration before I started making the film.
- The last really expensive trip we took was so uncomfortable. It's so lazy. I want somebody to give me a great $30 massage as opposed to a bad $265 massage.
- I've been given an amazing opportunity and I could not be more grateful. But I also know that all this will eventually die off. It's not real. It will go away and then you'll go away and then, I don't know, I'll be left sitting in some English hotel room.
- Look, I'm going to take full advantage of this situation just because I love working with great filmmakers. But I've been around for a while, and I'm not going to play into the hype that I'm some great, you know, discovery.
- You have to be okay with wins and losses. You can't just be looking for the wins and, when the losses happen, you can't buy more and more because you're sure it's going to bounce. We call that revenge trading.
- I have to tell you, you can't have an ego when you're an actor. A lot of actors have them, but in reality most of those people are just sensitive artists dying for a hug and a compliment.
- I covered my face because they had taken my wisdom teeth out.
- I used to go to Vegas and play the horses, and then I realised how ridiculous that was. There is no winning in gambling, but there is on the stock market.
- I love the competitive part of stocks. A lot of fear and greed, that's all it is. All I see is green and red.
- It's probably a bit of a power trip when you befriend somebody enough that they trust you to tell you things.
- Suddenly, I'm in movies that people are excited about, and that is a nice change.
- The next couple of jobs will determine, at least from a business point of view, if I'm a guy who's actually the real thing or I'm a guy who's had a nice moment.
- When I was in jail I could only think about what the average person has to go through - the person who has no power to go to the press or no money to hire a lawyer.
- I remember at the premiere of my second movie I started crying. I thought, I'm so bad that I either have to stop this and do something else or learn what I'm doing.
- Football? Forget it. I didn't have that thing inside me where I wanted to smash against somebody and watch them break. I was too sensitive for that and disliked being that sensitive.
- George W. Bush brought a lot of minorities into his administration, which was a positive thing, and they had some issues that they wanted to press, but 9/11 really gave them direction. It gave them a purpose.
- I'm very happy to be involved with great filmmakers.
- I'm really, really lucky. I was given my dad's good genes.
- I was invited to a couple of races, but I was doing a play in New York.
- To complain now would be kind of sad. I like the way things are going.
- I have a long way to catch up. I have to start with the pros this year, about 20 seconds back.
