- I'm ruthlessly picky when it comes to the crafting of an album, the choosing of musicians, the right mikes, the right studios. There was a time when it was, 'whatever you want.' Then, as you learn a little bit more about your tastes, I don't give in to that kind of thing.
- When you have the chance to present yourself vocally, you realize a kind of brand develops around that vocal, and you start to see the public consciousness of you is only about one half of your brain.
- It wasn't that I got pinned against my locker, but I was intensely aware that the things I valued weren't shared by anyone. Girls didn't like me, and I had few friends.

- I first started listening to Sondheim's work when I was a kid.
- I've seen a lot of people burn very brightly and very quickly, and I think you can become overindulgent sooo quickly in this business, and so I try not to fall into any of the trappings that would affect me very negatively.
- Everybody wants to experiment, wants to explore. You should hear me at karaoke. I can sing anything you throw at me. I can do a good Dave Grohl.
- I don't have a circus around me, and that's a choice. I like to be on Planet Earth as much as possible.
- After using four different languages on an album, it's tough to decide which one I'm gonna actually learn to speak. I always study the lyric, make sure I know what I'm singing, and try to get the pronunciation as perfect as possible.
- There are so many incredible causes, no one better than the other. There are lots of organizations that need our help and lots of ways we need to help one another.
- I did improv in junior high school. Figuring out my comedic timing helped my confidence in talking to the bullies and talking to people in class. If I could make them laugh, then I was in; I was OK.

- Comedy and music are so similar because it's all about timing.
- What most people know about me, they know through my music. This time, I've tried to open that door as wide as possible. These songs are a giant step closer to who I really am and what my music is all about. Hence the title.

- In ballet class, I felt like Ralph Wiggum.
