- The swelling epidemic of human trafficking makes a mockery of the law and its protections.

- American workers and American entrepreneurs can compete with anybody, anywhere if our government will stop making America a cost-prohibitive place to do business.
- Through the 1980s and '90s, evangelicals sought to turn back the forces of secularization.

- The allegations against Roy Moore are very serious. In the state of Missouri, they are criminal - these are criminal allegations.
- Taxpayer-funded abortion, especially the devil's bargain with Planned Parenthood, must cease immediately. To be clear, that means I believe Planned Parenthood should receive no tax monies of any kind.
- Abortion is not a right. It is a violent act against the defenseless. It violates every principle of morality and should be barred by American law. Until that day, I fully support bans on partial-birth abortion, third-trimester abortion, and indeed every limit that can receive public support.

On the contrary, there is a cancer of violence, a modern-day slavery growing in America by the day, in the very places where we live and work. It's called human trafficking.
- My first job out of law school was on the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, where Gorsuch is a judge. I observed in the year that I worked at the court what many litigants and commentators have since noted: that Gorsuch possesses an incisive legal mind, writes with skill and wit, and is scrupulously fair.
- We need an attorney general that's going to be an advocate for the state of Missouri and is willing to intervene in the regulatory process and go to court to protect Missourians from over-regulation.
- The people in Washington are getting rich with our money. Under President Barack Obama, the federal government swelled to record size, and it took more and more of our money to pay for it. Who benefitted? Not Missouri farmers or workers.
- Many entrepreneurs embrace profit-making and charitable purposes. Companies such as shoes seller Toms and eyeglass firm Warby Parker sell products at a profit with a pledge to devote part of their earnings to the needy.
