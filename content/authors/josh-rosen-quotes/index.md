- I'm not going to change who I am. I still am me.

- I'm just a regular dude.
- At some point, universities have to do more to prepare players for university life and help them succeed beyond football. There's so much money being made in this sport. It's a crime to not do everything you can to help the people who are making it for those who are spending it.

- I'm actually not that big a fan of reading.
- Starting off, I was pretty arrogant. They handed an 18-year-old the keys to a D1 FBS-contending university. I blew up a little bit, said some things I didn't mean, and that follows you. You get one chance to make a first impression. I made the wrong one.
- I will be O.K. without football. I want to fight for the people who won't be O.K.

- Over the last three years, UCLA has helped me grow as an athlete, a scholar, and a member of the community. I have made some mistakes along the way; however, I am grateful that I made those mistakes backed by such a supportive and positive university so that I could learn from them and better myself.
- I broke my left arm when I was 8, at a friend's house, when we were jumping off a balcony and throwing down dunks.
- I just never in my life imagined not graduating college, so I feel like it's kind of my obligation to my parents, almost, to give them a degree in return for everything they've given me.
- There are guys who have no business being in school, but they're here because this is the path to the NFL. There's no other way. Then there's the other side that says raise the SAT eligibility requirements. OK, raise the SAT requirement at Alabama and see what kind of team they have. You lose athletes, and then the product on the field suffers.
- I am who I am, and I think that's why I'm very grateful to be an Arizona Cardinal: because the team that picked me, they picked me.

- I was thrown into the spotlight pretty quickly at UCLA.
- When it comes to the draft process, I'm going to be - I'm not going to say anything stupid - but I'm going to be my authentic, true self, and hopefully someone in an organization says, 'That's my guy.'

- I want to be me, and the Arizona Cardinals know what they are getting. They are not getting a kid that is going to say stupid things and piss people off unnecessarily. They are going to get a kid that everyone knows who they are getting every single day I walk into the building.
- Coming out of high school, Ricky Town was the dude. He was going to SC; I was going to UCLA. He was No. 1 in the country; I was No. 2.
- I don't think you can go back to any team I ever played on and find someone who will say I was a bad teammate.
- Your primary job is to be a football player, and you've got to accomplish that task before you go out and do anything else, really.
- Quarterback - it's a boring, monotonous position that revolves around consistency.
- My father has fought to protect people from predatory pharmaceutical companies and to make sure drug payments and kickbacks to doctors are disclosed.
- The NFL should be more worried about pensions than CTE.
- I try to be as good of a person as I can be. I try to be a generally kind person.

- I want to ultimately own the world.
- I think the teams know more than I do in the sense of where I'd best fit. I might be a bit of a unique personality, so hopefully they can pick me apart, and if a team really feels that I'm their guy, hopefully they'll go and get me.
- I can be a prickly personality at times, but none of it's ever malicious. I don't think anyone who really knows me on a deep level thinks I'm a bad guy. I like to think I'm a good guy.
- It's different in the NFL because you're getting paid to get hit. In college, you're taking hits for someone else to make money.
- You can't put as much into one thing as you want, and I felt like I was shortchanging football a little bit by giving school so much time.
- I enjoy making people laugh, but what I find funny and put online, others might misconstrue and find jerkish.
