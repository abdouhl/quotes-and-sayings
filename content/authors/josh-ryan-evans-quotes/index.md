- I always knew I wanted to be a character in the movies. When I was growing up, I had to have a lot of surgery, and I spent a lot of time recovering at home and in the hospital. Watching movies took me away from my own problems and gave me a total escape.
- Dream big!
- I have had heart surgery three times, so I know what it was like to have pins and needles stuck in you.
- My size is an asset to me. People write roles for me. If I was just another blond-haired, brown-eyed, 18-year-old actor, I'd be left unrecognized. People remember me.
- It's not the size of the dreamer, it's the size of the dream.
- Everybody said, 'You hit it so big when you were on 'Ally McBeal.' ' I didn't do anything for a year after 'Ally McBeal,' and I had to write David Kelley to get myself back on 'Ally' a second time because I thought the character should be on again.
- I realized my life was not going to be, per se, normal.
- I'm not evil, but some people are freaked out by a living doll.
