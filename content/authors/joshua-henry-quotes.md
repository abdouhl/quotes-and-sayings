- You wanna work with people who you have a rapport with. You finish each other's sentences a bit creatively when you've worked together for a while.
- I avoided the party scene at the University of Miami. I came in to study musical theater, and I felt so behind. I literally knew nothing.
- I love being in the gym and am training six days a week; I do a lot of high-intensity interval training so that my heart rate gets really high, and I practice, as I'm doing that, taking really deep breaths, and that really helps in a song and in a style of music where you have to sing long, flowing lines.
- I've been really fortunate to do several shows on Broadway; the longest run I've done is nine months, and that was 'Porgy and Bess.' The shortest run I've done was about a month and a half: my first Broadway lead in 'The Scottsboro Boys.'
- I'm not Mr. Brooding.
- Theatre is very cutthroat, especially here in New York!
- I've certainly never liked the idea of being put in a box. I loved being part of shows like 'American Idiot' and 'In the Heights,' and I take pride in being able to sing different styles, not just 'Old Man River.'
- I love playing roles where it's not just the good guy or the bad guy.
- 'In The Heights' was my favorite show, so hip hop is something that's really close to my heart, but aside from the hip hop, there are so many wondrous things about it.
- I realized no matter how famous you are, you're still human, and sometimes you need a chicken wing!
- I think it's nice when you come into the room and the director has a plan, a vision of exactly what he or she wants the piece to be. Because when that happens, then you feel safe. You feel safe to make choices and to do something big and just fly because there's a structure around you.
- I remember when I was rehearsing 'Scottsboro Boys,' I was in 'American Idiot,' so, every night, I was screaming, singing these high, belty Cs and Ds, and then, during the day, I would be doing these legato lines - I am very lucky that I have had the training that I have so that I could handle all of that.
- Everyone's got something that they've held onto from their childhood or from a past relationship, someone who's told you what you are, and it's leaving all that behind and living a happy life and realizing that a lot of that is inside you - really uncovering that. The story - those themes - are heavy themes that everyone can connect to.
- I was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, in Canada. I left when I was three. My parents went to Miami, and that's where I grew up.
- I grew up playing sports, so I think of what it would be like to be in the NBA if you were a great player when Michael Jordan was playing. You could've been a phenomenal player, but you're in the Jordan era. That's the unfortunate thing about the competitive nature of entertainment. But we know what we signed up for.
- My first show in high school was 'The Music Man.' I was a junior. I played Harold Hill. I did the role at the University of Miami, too. I do love that musical. To do it in high school and college and then to do it professionally - I mean, come on!
- I'd really like to do 'Floyd Collins.' I love Adam Guettel.
- I remember being in my house from when I was, like, five to when I was, like, 12. When hurricanes would happen, you just hold hands, and you say, 'You know what, we have each other. We're praying,' and this roof can literally peel off of your house.
- I like directors who come ready to challenge you to ask the right questions about your character, and I know that directors appreciate that in actors as well.
- I feel such a connection to 'Violet.'
- To have 'In The Heights' be my first show in New York after moving here, I remember feeling at the time like, you know, 'It doesn't get any better than this.'
- 'The Light in the Piazza' is one of my top three musicals of all time.
- 'American Idiot' was the hardest show that I've ever done - ever.
- People all learn things differently, and sometimes imagination isn't considered as useful a tool as it can be in the learning process - especially in school in subjects like math and science.
- I play guitar; I can sing a little bit.
- My parents were very spiritual folks. I grew up studying the Bible. My dad's a Christian academy teacher. I grew up with a big spiritual influence. It's a big part of my life.
- Theater is certainly - is my first love, if I had to pick.
- It's always relevant - moving forward into the future and finding out who you are. I think those themes never get stale.
- I'm obsessed with 'Hamilton.' I've seen it, like, three times, and if I could get a weekly pass, I would.
- We all have something in our past that is gripping us, and 'Violet' is very much about leaving those things behind.
- I think there's something special about getting a moment perfect or near perfect. In a film, you can do that.
- History can just be so unkind as time passes.
- What I know is that the possibilities are always endless when it comes to 'Hamilton.' It's broken several records. Audiences are really being touched by it, they're being moved by it, and they're in love with the music.
- When success comes, it changes everything, so I'm interested in portraying what that's like, and I think I have a lot of connection with that.
- Being in the bands of a hurricane, it's not like a tornado that's going to pass very quickly. It's the most serious thing that you will ever experience next to, I'm sure, an earthquake.
- My mom works at an accounting firm; my dad's a math teacher.
- It's really empowering when you see yourself represented in entertainment and, especially, onstage when you're talking about how this country came to be.
- I really liked the idea of playing - I won't say the underdog - but characters who have a lot of conflict.
- In coming to New York, I got my first Broadway show six months after I got here. So that song, 'Movin' Too Fast,' means so much to me, knowing that feeling where it's just where you imagined yourself, but it's flying by you at a million miles an hour.
- I would love, love, love to do a comedy like 'Gentleman's Guide,' something farcical and fast-paced, but I also want to do something that hasn't been written yet: the story of Sidney Poitier. A lot of people tell me that I look like him.
- I love the idea of challenging what the standards is.
- I've done a lot of research about the Civil Rights movement, and I'm fascinated with how difficult it would have been for a black man to show feelings toward a white woman in that time period.
- The themes in 'Violet' are universal: accepting yourself with all of your flaws, moving on, and the forgiveness and freedom that comes along with that.
- I loved music before I stumbled onto acting.
- Even when I was studying musical theater in college, after I would have theory at 8 in the morning and be on crew for productions until 11 at night, from 12 A.M. to 3 A.M. I was hanging out with jazz musicians.
- I went to the University of Miami.
- Prior to being in 'Carousel,' I had only seen the movie. So, when I read the script, I felt like it was a lot deeper than the movie portrayed it to be.
