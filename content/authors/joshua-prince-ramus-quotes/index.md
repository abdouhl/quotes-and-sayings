- Some people think architecture is about the genius sketch; I don't. Great architecture is a collaboration among a lot of people over a long period of time.
- Working off one genius sketch is not the way great architecture should be made.
- Architects have created this fake separation between creation and execution. You can see it in architecture schools, where the students look down on going to contracts classes.
- 'Form follows function' comes with so much baggage. It's a worthless phrase because you'll never take it for what it means.
- I always wanted to do something creative, but as much as I'm creative, it's in a really hard-core, right-brained way. For me, painting doesn't do it for me. There's no constraint.
- When I went to college, I thought I was going to become a professional musician. I was a French horn player, so I went to Yale to study with a very unusual French horn player.
- Architecture is by definition a very collaborative process.
