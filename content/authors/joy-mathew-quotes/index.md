- I did the good priest and the bad and felt that I am getting stereotyped in priest roles. I am not picking them anymore.
- I don't classify film people into old and new gen and so get along with all.
- I was never after celebrity status.
- After 'Amen' people started recognising me. It made me think that acting is better than direction.
- Johns will give me a good critique of my work. Before starting my film 'Shutter' I gave the script to Johns for his opinion.
- There is no such thing as art cinema, there is only cinema.
- I always say that you get to see a 'Malayali' only in the Gulf. Even in Kerala, you will only see somebody from Kozhikode, Alappuzha, or Kollam, never a quintessential Malayali!
- I do my social networking while I travel.
- As an actor, you are used to portraying other characters. You can pick up any mannerism or body language that suits the character. But to be yourself and not look pretentious is a difficult thing to do.
- Cinema is ultimately a work of art, it is all about sound and visuals.
- Ranjith and I have known each other for long. We're both from Calicut and share similar interests.
- It was Ranjith who inspired me to be a film maker. And ever since I began the shoot, he is keeping a track of the progress. In fact, he knows the script of 'Shutter' better than me.
- I was really surprised to see how critical the Malayali audiences are. It is really overwhelming that people genuinely want good scripts and do not miss a chance to applaud good scripts.
- Happiness is life.
- You know, for me, Facebook is now what Manachira ground in Kozhikode used to be. A meeting place of friends. It is where I speak up, listen to, quarrel and make up.
- The film has been titled 'Uncle,' and will revolve around a family, like 'Shutter.' The social and political milieu of Kerala is of much importance in the movie and it's about an unusual situation a family is made to face.
- As an actor I don't have a problem with any kind of films.
- I keep getting advice on the social media that I should be selective in accepting roles. But, as an actor, I get attracted to every role I'm offered.
- Our films appear to have become realistic once again. 'Thondimuthalum Driskakshiyum' is a fine example. I am glad that I could also contribute to this phase of Malayalam cinema with 'Shutter.'
- Let's just say I get along well with the youngsters. Working with them energises me, and I find that I have a lot to learn from them.
- It was during a drive together that I first conceived the story of a teenage girl and a friend of her father's. That was how we decided to make 'Uncle.'
- Cinema is a passion for me, not a profession.
- An artist or a writer can boast about working for himself, but it would be highly irresponsible of a director to say such a thing as the sweat of many people is involved in realising his dream and he should respect that.
- I never thought that 'Shutter' would have as many remakes when I conceived the film all those years ago. It is nice to see a film that I made talking so many different languages.
- The public should want to see a movie and it should entertain them. If it fails to do so, it is not good cinema.
- It is very easy to make an art film. They are an exercise in self-deception.
- I don't think it is right that a small number of people should decide what is good and what is not good.
- Mammootty came on board unexpectedly. 'Uncle,' which I am co-producing with Sajai Sebastian, was meant to be a low-budget film and we had almost cast another actor in the titular role. But, during the shoot of 'Puthan Panam,' I narrated the film's plot to Mammootty, who liked it and wanted to do the movie.
- After working on a film with John Abraham, it is very difficult to work with anyone else. It leaves you with very little to learn.
- If your film is honest, people will accept it.
- I took to cinema because I found cinema was the medium for what I wanted to say through 'Shutter;' it was something beyond the scope of a play.
- In college I received the Best Actor award for four consecutive years under Calicut University.
- Divinity lies in service to the poor.
- I treat everyone equally whether you are an intellectual, a layman or an auto driver.
- Experience maketh an artist, not books or academics.
- When it comes to Kerala, reasoning gets the upper hand rather than emotions.Our political outlook is related to the educational standards and political consciousness.
- We received our initial inspiration from our family, as from childhood we exhibited an inclination towards art. While Johns randomly drew pictures, I used to present dramas for my siblings. But when we grew up, we both got addicted to our interests and it was fueled by political activism.
