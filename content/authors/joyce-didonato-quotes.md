- I'm a mezzo-soprano, so the whole diva thing... I'm not the kind of performer who puts on a persona off-stage as well, and the days of arriving with steamer trunks and hat boxes are over.
- I think I've learned more about Baroque music than any other genre.
- It's tricky when you're doing a recording, because the only weapon you have is your voice and the delivery of that voice. You don't have a gesture or a facial expression, there are no costumes or set pieces. Everything needs to be present in the voice.
- I want people to know me for my singing. I've never been searching for a label of being a fashion plate or a top model. That's a thing that's very short-lived, and it's dealing with a superficial level of this which doesn't really appeal to me.
- I've learned that you don't need a lot in life. If it can't fit into a suitcase, you don't really need it.
- One of the things I love about opera is that it's the combination of all the art forms, and certainly the world of fashion is a big deal in it.
- I know that every time I step on the stage it's a real gift, so I try not to take it for granted, and I try to make it an experience that the public can really participate in.
- I think yoga builds strength, flexibility, and calming of the mind - which is never a bad thing.
