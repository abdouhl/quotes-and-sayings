- Health care organizations don't ask us to interface to every type of module because they understand that it could cause safety problems.
- I was an undergrad math major and a grad student in computer science. I'm hugely introverted, not atypical of math majors.
- I get so many requests for interviews. If I talk to everyone, we can't do our job with our customers and work on our software. It would be hard to stay focused.
- One of the things that made Epic strong when I wrote the original code was that it never occurred to me to do anything other than put the patient at the center. I developed a clinical system at a time when the health care world had pretty much only billing and lab systems available.
- I like to go around, and people not knowing who I am.
- I like to keep some privacy, be a normal person.
