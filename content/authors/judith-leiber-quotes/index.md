- I have a few customers who have two or three hundred bags. When you see a lady carrying a little dog bag or a little cat bag or an egg, it makes you happy.
- I always had a good dexterity. The story in my family goes that at the age of 3 I could thread needles faster than anybody.
- I have a good sense of humor. I think everything we do should have whimsy in it.
- I am not pushy. You want it, you buy it. Most people hit the customer over the head. But if you're too self-important, it's kind of repellent.
- If I make a new bag I love, I don't keep it.
