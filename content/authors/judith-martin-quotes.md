- Learn graceful ways of saying no and of pointing out that this pressure to do something is not in line with most people's wishes.
- The greater the controversy, the more you need manners.
- One of the big no-nos in cyberspace is that you do not go into a social activity, a chat group or something like that, and start advertising or selling things.

- When people start hurling insults at you, you know their minds are closed and there's no point in debating. You disengage yourself as quickly as possible from the situation.

- I make a distinction between manners and etiquette - manners as the principles, which are eternal and universal, etiquette as the particular rules which are arbitrary and different in different times, different situations, different cultures.
- For email, the old postcard rule applies. Nobody else is supposed to read your postcards, but you'd be a fool if you wrote anything private on one.

- There are three social classes in America: upper middle class, middle class, and lower middle class.
- First. I began my career as a copy girl. and the White House coverage, for example, was in the then-Women's section. So it was social coverage. It wasn't news, although we often got rather startling news out of it.
- 'Honesty' in social life is often used as a cover for rudeness. But there is quite a difference between being candid in what you're talking about, and people voicing their insulting opinions under the name of honesty.
- Freedom without rules doesn't work. And communities do not work unless they are regulated by etiquette.
- The language of clothing is high symbolism and we all, in moments where we need to know this, realize it.
- Honesty has come to mean the privilege of insulting you to your face without expecting redress.

- Email is very informal, a memo. But I find that not signing off or not having a salutation bothers me.
- Chaperons, even in their days of glory, were almost never able to enforce morality; what they did was to force immorality to be discreet. This is no small contribution.
- The mistake people keep making is that if they find a wonderful new tool, like email, they have to give up all others. They don't. You have simply added another very useful means to your communications repertoire.

- When a society abandons its ideals just because most people can't live up to them, behavior gets very ugly indeed.
- It's far more impressive when others discover your good qualities without your help.
- I am a traditionalist, and I'm an innovator. Most of what I do is to weigh change and legislate to the best of my ability on what should change and what should not. Do I have a respect for tradition? Of course I do. Do I have a blind belief in it? No.
