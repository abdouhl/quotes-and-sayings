- I am not joining politics. I don't intend to contest election. I am happy to be back to doing normal things, be it films or other work.
- When I look back at my career and my life and how much I have learnt, I feel blessed with what I have. I have stopped fighting with myself.
- Motherhood has made me a much better person. I see everything from a new perspective - with a sense of wonderment.
- There were a few models who used to stay close to my building. I used to admire them and tell my friends that I did. Those models told me get into modeling.
- Everything does not happen according to a plan, and you learn your lessons the hard way.
- I'd jump to do a film with Aamir Khan. Aamir thinks through things before starting a project.
- I only know acting. But had I learnt singing earlier, I would have become a singer.
- Pay disparity has always been there.
- I am like a friend to my children, but when things get out of hand, the 'mum' in me springs up!
- Why do we wait for tragedy to strike to tell someone how special they are, or how special they were?
- Motherhood changed me completely.
- When actors are vying for the same kinds of roles, there's bound to be a little rivalry. Deep friendships cannot be forged when you are competing with each other.
- I think more from my heart. My brains don't work as much.
- I am my favourite villain!
- There is absolutely no planning and strategising involved in my career graph.
- There is an amazing power getting to know your inner self and learning how to use it and not fight with the world. If you know what makes you happy, your personality, interests and capabilities, just use them, and everything else flows beautifully.
- I have worked with Divya Dutta in two National Award-winning Punjabi films. I have known her a long time; she is a fantastic actress. I sent her flowers after I saw 'Bhaag Milkha Bhaag.' Shabana Ji is, of course, a legendary actress. It was a great experience working with her.
- I would love to have a nice straight nose, which God never gave me!
- I try to use the landline whenever I can. We cannot do without the mobile phones, but we don't need to use them indiscriminately. We are overusing it; we are misusing it.
- I don't think there has been a huge shift. Most of the films still focus on Salman Khan, Shah Rukh Khan, Aamir Khan, Akshay Kumar, etc. The percentage of films that have someone like a Kangana Ranaut shining in it is really low.
- The mobile phone is not a toy; it's a device that uses radio waves.
- We have fought and cried. But I think, over time, one falls, learns, grows, and moves on. Shah Rukh and I have had our share of highs and lows.
- The future will take care of itself. My plans have fallen flat. Nothing that I planned has worked for me so far. So I don't plan anymore. I keep short-term plans.
- Our films tremendously influence people. But at the same time, no one goes to the cinema to listen to lectures, so if you have an interesting story, and if you can showcase it as a film, and its messages are good, then it's like an icing on the cake: it shall be a superhit. And if I get those kind of films, I'll definitely want to work on it.
- At the end of the day, we always show that truth triumphs. We don't leave the movie in the middle saying, 'Great, pick whatever you want to and go out there and do something wrong'. Bollywood is not the only influence in a person's life. They are also affected by their family and friends.
- Parenting now is a two-way relationship where you learn from each other.
