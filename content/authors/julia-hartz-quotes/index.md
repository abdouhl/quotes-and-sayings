- I encourage women who are starting families to think about the five-year horizon. The first few years of parenthood are really hard, but if you stick it out, it gets easier.

- There's always a little bit of friction when you're trying to democratize an industry.

- There has been an intention since day one that it's as important to us that we build profits as much as we build a wonderful culture and a lasting legacy of a great company.

- Acquiring customers at the start is one of the hardest things you'll ever experiences as an entrepreneur.
- I truly believe there is this confidence gap, at least for me. You have to 'manipulate' yourself to get over it,and I do think it has something to do with being a female. If you live in fear or doubt and have that confidence gap, you are simply not going to achieve your full potential and what you know you can achieve.
- Leading Eventbrite has taught me a lot about how to connect with people to drive results.
- I started my career in Hollywood, where I learned the rumors were true - having success there really was dictated by how who you knew, not what you knew. I grew frustrated by the fact that careers could be made and broken by relationships alone.
- I have not always been a risk taker.
- If you think about stripping away 80 percent of the things that don't matter and focusing on the the 20 percent that will actually make a difference, I think you'll find great results even in the toughest of situations and the harshest of environments.
