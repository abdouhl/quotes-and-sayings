- If you feel good, you're going to look good.
- No one is perfect and everyone wishes they could change something about themselves.
- I was actually a huge tomboy growing up.
- In terms of withstanding incredible amounts of pain - both physical and emotional - I don't think there's any better training than ballet.
- When I'm in L.A., I try to run the canyons or play tennis with friends a few times a week. I've tried working out with a trainer and going to the gym, but I'd just much rather be outside.
- I'm a Native American actress.
- One of my modeling bookers told me that the most important thing is to try to be vigilant about taking care of yourself. Get sleep, don't be afraid to trim your hair even if you're trying to grow it out, don't bite your fingernails, and stay in shape. A lot of it is in the little things.
- When I was growing up, I was really into 'Rent' and I actually slept on the street in New York all night to get to sit in the first few rows for it.
- There aren't very many notable Native American female figures historically. That's the way that it's been. Pocahontas and Sacajawea.
- I'm, like, a real nerd, in that I will take a book that is three inches thick and disappear and not leave until it's done.
- It is so gratifying to hear from people who look up to you and see you in these places that they never thought they could ever dream to be. It's emotional. You really feel like you're opening up people's minds, who otherwise thought that they couldn't dream big. That's such a huge opportunity. It's such a gift.
