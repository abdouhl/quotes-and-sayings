- I don't get inoculations or take anti-malaria tablets when I go abroad; I take the homeopathic alternative, called 'nosodes', and I'm the only one who never goes down with anything.
- I love a bit of glamour - who doesn't? - but I probably wouldn't be able to pull it off.
- I am extremely content in my life - sometimes to the point where I really should find something to moan about!
- When you come out of your teens, you think you're sussed. But you don't know who you are at 22. You're constantly trying to fit in. You get a little lost.
- It's not so much that I'd like to play a raunchy character, but I would like to play someone my own age. I'm always playing down, but I guess it's good because it means I've got a longer life in my acting career.
- I'm into the law of attraction and quantum physics. Like cosmic ordering. It's all about thinking lovely things that you would like in life, and feeling good about them before they manifest, so that by the time they do, you don't want them because you're on to your next desire.
- Actors think they're far more important than they are, and that can only lead to hurt. People with colossal self-importance have very far to fall.

- I just love doing costume dramas; I am very lucky, as I see myself as a part-time time traveller.
- I love to travel with my family or my two best friends because I completely trust them. I forced my two best friends into learning to scuba dive with me in Sri Lanka - it was amazing but also hideous because we were learning in very difficult seas.
- It's a tremendous feeling walking on to a set with a live audience and making them laugh, but I love drama, and I love drama where there's the ability to bring comedy into it because in a lot of tragic circumstances in life there is comedy to be had.
- Ever since I can remember feeling love for my parents, I've been frightened of losing them.
- I want to be in 'The Hobbit.' I love fantasy and mythical adventure films. I believe in fairies and angels. I believe in nature's spirit, that there are other realms, other planets, life forms.
- It distresses me when I take my seven-year-old nephew out. I cook healthy food, and he wants to go to McDonald's. He doesn't even like the food; he just wants the toys, the Happy Meals. I can't stand to see people walking down the street eating fast food.
- I wouldn't miss the fame. I don't go out hunting for it. I try to avoid it and to slip into the background wherever I go.
- I think it's healthy to be insecure, to have nerves.
- I am always baffled by age, but to be honest with you, I feel like I am about 34. I feel better now and I am certainly healthier than I was in my early 30s. I am more rounded, too.
- My dad's so likeable, you wouldn't feel in competition with him. If any boyfriends have ever felt that, they're long gone.
- I'm not much of a baby freak - I like them when they're older.

- After playing Saffy in 'Ab Fab', I needed to take time out from acting to see if I really wanted to do it. I had been doing it for a very long time and I was being sent the same sort of scripts again and again.
- I've got a string of disastrous relationships behind me. I don't think I'm an easy person to live with.
- I'm on a constant path of self-discovery and change. I'm trying to become a better person, a nicer person. I love therapy - it's brilliant.
- What keeps me awake at night? Just about everything! I worry that I am not there for my family enough. So what keeps me awake at night is general guilt!
- Cuba is such a beautiful country, and everywhere you go, there's music and people dancing - especially in Havana.
- Being a mum is something that's never bothered me too much. I have never felt a strong need to have children, but I am not averse to it either.
- It's very hard to dramatise something factual and not make it look overdone, but also not to make it look so under-dramatised that it's dull.
- I'm terrible at solving things. I'm really bad and haven't got any sort of lateral thinking capacity. I am your perfect audience for a mystery. I love that kind of stuff. I'm always on the edge of my seat.
