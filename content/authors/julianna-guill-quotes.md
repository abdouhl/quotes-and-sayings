- I'm now more about romantic beauty. The dominatrix thing is over. You never look as good in person as you do in 'Maxim,' but it's fun. It's all like a fantasy.
- One of my favorite things about working on 'Glory Daze' is getting to wear amazing '80s outfits coupled with fabulously over-the-top hair and makeup. My wardrobe usually consists of colorful sweaters, denim skirts, high-waisted shorts, crop tops, dangly earrings, jean jackets, and, of course, panty hose and shoulder pads.
- I can do a 'Maxim' shoot and be super sexy, but I'm also just a 21-year-old girl, and I look 17 sometimes.
- My cheerleader part in 'Fired Up!' is really funny.
