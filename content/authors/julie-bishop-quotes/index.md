- The message from the United States and Europe is that governments must live within their means.
- Well they're very, very genuine concerns at present as to the status of the 800 people who are to be sent by Australia to Malaysia. There's concern about the status of asylum seekers in Malaysia generally, but there's concern about the status of the 800 to be sent.
- We are increasingly recognising and accepting, respecting and celebrating, our cultural diversity.
- But it's not just the cattle producers, it's all the attendant industries like transport and shipping and feed producers and the like. There will be enormous ramifications across the beef industry generally as a result of the Government's decision to ban all exports to all of the abattoirs in Indonesia.
- It is a fact that governments tend to put in place policies and strategies in response to current scenarios.
- Greater public recognition will also be critical in encouraging prevention and early intervention, and more generally in building public support to meet the challenges of dementia.
- Prevention is one of the few known ways to reduce demand for health and aged care services.
- The Australian economy is resilient, but business and consumer confidence is fragile.
- My point is this, the Government made this decision to ban totally beef exports into Indonesia, even to compliant abattoirs and this will have enormous consequences for the beef cattle industry across Australia.
- Ageing means a loss of a number of skills over time.
- The strongest initiative that government can take to ensure Australia is prepared for population ageing, is to maintain a strong economy, and a secure nation.
- When the Australian Government looked at how to meet the challenges, and the opportunities, presented by our ageing population, it saw that an all-encompassing approach was a prerequisite.
- Australia has an increasingly multicultural society.
- The Gillard government must give up its addiction to wasteful spending borrowing and taxing.
- Today it has been estimated that the average 70 year old has four chronic conditions and consumes an average of 35 PBS scripts per year for those conditions.
- I call on the Australian Government to set out the conditions upon which they will provide a taxpayer funded backing for wholesale term funding for Australian deposit taking institutions. I call on the Government it make clear the conditions upon which taxpayer funds will be used in this way.
- We know that so many of the conditions and diseases that we associate with ageing can often be prevented or in fact their onset delayed if we just took preventative steps earlier in our lives.
- At the last census it indicated that about 22 per cent of Australians were born overseas.
- There are genuine concerns about the status of children to be sent to Malaysia and also there are genuine concerns about the human rights record in Malaysia.
- We know we are entering a period of transformation in aged care.
- We preserve the status quo, preserve existing systems.
- The concern is the Government is not coming clean and informing the Australian public of the assumptions that they have made to give rise to a $10.4 billion package.
- Our cultural diversity has most certainly shaped our national character.
- And I believe that the best buy in public health today must be a combination of regular physical exercise and a healthy diet.
- Synergy and serendipity often play a big part in medical and scientific advances.
- Community care is a fundamental, an essential, an enduring part of our aged care system.
- We are already seeing older people wanting greater choice in how, when and where they receive care.
- Australia is already a world leader in dementia research, treatment and care.
- Advances in science and medical research and public health policies have meant that life expectancy for Australians is one of the highest in the world.
- Tobacco companies are legally operating entities in Australia. If the Government thinks that they should not make donations to political parties, well then they should ban them operating as legally structured entities in Australia.
