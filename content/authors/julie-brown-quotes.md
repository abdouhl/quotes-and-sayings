- I think I knew I was funny in Elementary School. I think most funny people realize it when they're young. It tends to come out of stress or trauma - something that makes you want to be funny.
- I got confused. I thought it was a K.Y. scare, so I bought 2000 jars of personal lubricant. I still have some.
- I don't just want to be successful I want to have fun.
- I think you figure out how to be funny by necessity. It's not a natural thing, being funny in the face of tragedy is kind of demented.
- It would have been very impossible to deal with this attention when I was younger. I'm thrilled with the success, but at this point I also think it's hilariously silly.
- I think comedians have a function in society, which is to make fun of our icons.
- There was plenty of dysfunction in my family and I went to Catholic School with these psychotic nuns. I would always try to be funny to lighten the mood.
- It would be thrilling if I could be boycotted or something. I think that's part of the thrill Madonna gets, when you know you've hit a nerve. But that doesn't scare me. To me what would be a lot scarier would be like appearing on an episode of 'Full House' or something.
- I hate being mean. I watch those roasts on Comedy Central and they make the hair on the back of my neck stand up.

- I was always trying to do things to make school fun.
- You have to do anything you can think of that gets you excited.
- I've known lots of people that are talented and nothing happens. It's not about talent, it's relentless drive.
- Going to Catholic school was what fueled me into comedy. The nuns were so brutal so I used to try to make my friends laugh.
- The best thing about becoming successful is that you get flowers all the time.
- I love Kathy Griffin, I think she's brilliant, but for me, there is a line when I go OK, that's too much.
- Be relentless and then you'll break through.
