- I sometimes think that theatre is a torture.
- I wouldn't even begin to presume that the talent of an able actor is anything like the talents of a prodigious musician.
- I'm hardly Hollywood material - they're interested in youth and perfection and I lay no claims to either. It's not a place that's particularly interested in talent.
- I have quite a robust relationship with regret. You simply don't know what the alternative would have been.
- If I could have any artist's work on my sitting room wall it would probably be by Van Gogh or Picasso.
- I do understand that onstage there are times when you think, 'I could not be more alive than I am at this moment. I can't do most things in life. This is what I'm for.'
- There's still a massive inequality between the genders. If you look at the trajectory of a male actor's career, there's no hesitation or hiatus. But women after the age of 35 to 40 are rarely placed in the centre of the story.
- In our own, theatre can be the place where we come together, reaching with and through stories, to who we are and to who we can be.
- In the garden of our house, when I was three. My brothers and I had a jumping wall. I remember it as enormously high, but it was probably only about a foot and a half.
- I have a wardrobe full of expensive clothes, but wear the same two T-shirts. I've never found a look.
- I grew up all over the world. My father was in the army and was posted to a new place every two and a half years. I have no geographical roots.
- I hope to have more time to think, to look at the sky, dealing with less crisis management, to learn another language, to travel.
- Everything contains its antithesis.
- I'd rather be useful than rich. It's more essential to feel you're doing something that's worth doing, rather than making a lot of money.
- Sometimes I think it'd be fun to do a completely different job for a while. You've got one life and you do the same job for the whole of it, and you think - was that a good use of a life?
- It is intensely frustrating. The longer you live, the more interesting life gets, and yet many of the parts involve carrying trays and putting lamb chops down in front of the leading man.
- I never have time to myself; it's the one thing about my life I would probably hope to change.
- I often wrangle with myself as an actor, and wrestle with the process. In striving for authenticity I often have the feeling I am falling short.
- I wanted to be the conduit for somebody else's experiences, filtered through me, and passed on to other people. Which is the job description, really.
- I often don't feel like the person I look like.
- Cruelty to children is the thing I can least bear in the world.
