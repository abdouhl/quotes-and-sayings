- If someone tells you over and over that everything's great, you immediately think, 'OK, what's the rest of the story?'

- I love the process of working with a filmmaker and the writers and the actors.
- I wrote songs when I was little, and I wrote a journal, but I don't think I knew how to let that truth come out yet.

- In detective land, you have to deal with a lot of intense emotions, so you yourself have to remain mostly unemotional and detached. These are people, like law enforcement and surgeons, in professions that don't have the luxury of being able to be emotional or to break down. In my line of work, it's almost a requirement.

- Over time, I've loved jazz, Miles Davis and Chet Baker, then Janis and Jimi and Creedence, then classic rock.
- Whatever I do, I'm always struggling to create a visceral experience. With my music, I'm more of a live performer these days. And film is such a different thing. It's where people sit in a dark theater. I want them to feel me as viscerally as if they were at a live show.
- I don't want a tan, but I do love blushes in colors that give you that whole sun-kissed thing.
