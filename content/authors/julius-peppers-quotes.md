- I was lucky because growing up in tiny little Bailey, North Carolina, we had a satellite dish, so we got WGN. Which meant we got almost every Bulls game.
- I tell you this: I'm not an outdoorsman. Actually, one of my things is to pick a little corner in Borders or Barnes & Noble and fall back and just read.

- After considering the ways that I might be able to help young college students, I decided to continue my support of the Light on the Hill scholarship.

- I love the game just as much as anybody else. But at the same time, I also understand that life is more than football, too. People might get that misconstrued sometimes, too, that I don't care because I'm not die-hard football, eat, sleep and drink it all day and all night.

- That one thing that people say about me taking plays off, I feel like somebody said that when I was playing in college and it has followed me throughout my career. Because I feel like if we had the film and you wanted to pick one person who was taking a play off on a particular play, you could pick anybody.
- That's what this game is about; it's about relationships.
- I'm not above criticism.
- If the opportunities are a little limited, then you've got to try to find a way to make something happen the best way you can.
- Every game, well most of them, come down to turnovers and the turnover battle.

- Different teams put me in different situations.
- In this game you only get a few opportunities.
