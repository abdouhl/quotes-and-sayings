- As an actor, you can play different age ranges and different ethnicities.
- My parents were always supportive of me in terms of expressing myself artistically. Art, musical instruments, singing - whatever I did, they were just really supportive.
- I didn't become an actor to be famous. I genuinely love acting and never expected to make a penny at it.
- When you love something, you're gonna be the best at it.
- If I could go back, I think I would be a rock star instead of an actor, man.
- I don't think I'm a star. I just love to act. I'm not thinking I'm even close to where I want to be.
- To be honest, I'm really into folk music, and I love Big Phony. I like Priscilla Ahn, and yeah, I really support Asian-American artists.
- It's funny - when I started acting, I didn't know I was going to be talking about Asian-American issues so much. You know what, though? It just comes with the territory, being ethnic.
- In life, try your best to do the right thing. Have fun while you're alive. Take advantage of every asset you have. Don't take anything for granted.
- I love Irvine. That's my 'hood. I went to USC and used to come home every weekend. It's in my comfort zone.
- I did an internship in the Silicon Valley during the Internet boom. I couldn't imagine sitting in a cubicle the rest of my life, so I gave acting a try. I would have been happy doing theater and making nothing.
- Being an actor is great; you chill in your trailer, and they bring you a breakfast burrito and coffee. But as director, you're responsible for every little thing.
- I'm just following my own art, and I just think that the only thing I can do to be a great artist is do the best job I can in whatever movie I do.
- I'm all about making my girl feel like she's the only woman in the world. Whether it's telling her how special she is or showing her with gifts and romantic dates, I want to make her happy.
- I'd love to work in a restaurant. You get to meet new people all the time and constantly socialize. There are no dull moments when you're serving. It would definitely be a fun job to have.
- I did this one movie with a great director named Wayne Kramer. It was 'Crossing Over,' and Harrison Ford, Ashley Judd and Ray Liotta were in it. I was one of the leads, and I thought this was it. It got shelved for two years, and then it was in theaters maybe a week. After that, I adopted a philosophy of, 'Hope for the best, expect the worst.'
- Just be yourself. As an actor, you pretend all day - that's what the job calls for. So, when it comes to my personal life, a woman who keeps it real is a breath of fresh air.
- As an actor, I don't really think you find yourself. I mean, once you find yourself, I think it becomes boring and you become set in your ways. I think, as an actor I think it's not a bad thing but more of a gift. It's something you're always doing as an actor. You're adjusting constantly.
- I'm gonna be pretty honest; there wasn't a lot of improv allowed on 'Eclipse.'
- I think that it'd be nice for other Asians to support other Asian artists and help each other instead of pull each other down.
- When it comes to romance, I believe in keeping it simple. With my last girlfriend, we were on our way to our favorite restaurant when I pretended that the car was crappin' out. I asked her to get out and check if smoke was coming from the exhaust. When she did, I popped the trunk and inside were six dozen roses and a stuffed bear.
- I had a date with a girl I called 'the parrot.' All she did was repeat everything I said. She never had an original thought of her own. Everything I liked, she liked. Everything I hated, she hated. It was annoying!
- 'Twilight' is reaching so many people, and I think it's a really good step in the right direction for diversity and opening up doors.
