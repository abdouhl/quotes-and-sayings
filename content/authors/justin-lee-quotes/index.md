- I want to do what I love, which is act, and hopefully through that, leave a positive impact somehow, someway, with somebody.
- One thing I'm working on is an episodic web series titled 'One Warm Night.' It's a kinda crazy, quirky series, filled with a lot of misfits, oddballs... ninjas.
- No matter how I cut my hair, when it grows out, it will always grow out into The Bowl. I just naturally have a bowl.
- I love food. I'm a huge food addict. I think in my past life I was a pig or something like that, but I love eating; I never stop eating.
- I guess you could say I was kind of a nerd in high school, so I was in the upper division math courses - I embrace my inner nerd.
- I do MMA and things like that, so any chance I get to do my own stunts, I love it.
- I was the runt of my class. So I got away with the whole 'Oh, he's so cute' thing. I was in upper division math courses, so I would have junior and senior girls in my class, and they'd just sit behind me and play with my hair. I didn't mind that so much.
- The fact that people are able to be positively impacted by any of my work is really just a blessing. And ultimately, that's what I want to do.
