- If you give us soft greens and soft fairways, we're going to tear it apart.
- So much of my life I've dedicated to golf, aspiring to win my first major championship. To be able to do so aged 24 is awesome.
- Every time I finish in the top 10, I go to the mall. We have a really sick mall here in Palm Beach, Fla., with a lot of high-end stores. I'll go in there and impulse buy for a couple of hours.
- Lately, I've been feeling like I wish I was smarter. I want to know about more things, I want to be able to talk to people more in depth about things in the world.
- It's tough because, in this day and age, it feels like it doesn't matter who you are or what you're doing. You can never do anything right, so you have to kind of tiptoe your way around sometimes.
- You know, it's tough, because I feel like you just can't win, you know? You say what's on your mind, and then you're a spoiled brat for complaining about something.
- There's things in my swing that get bad that we try to change, but we can't just remorph everything and start from scratch.
- Obviously it's easier to say, treat it like another event, but it's not, you know? It's just not. It's the Masters, and I want to win that tournament more than anything.

- I feel like the sky's the limit. I can do a lot of great things but none of them will happen if I don't continue to work hard.
- I wasn't mad, but it was maybe a little frustrating sometimes seeing some friends and peers my age do well. Not because I wasn't cheering for them - because I feel like I was as good as them.
- My dad and grandpa were big golfers, and I think any boy wants to be like their dad. So growing up around him being at the golf course, it was an easy choice for me.
- I finish what I eat. I'm not a leftover guy. I mean business when I eat dinner.
- Yeah, I've always been someone to celebrate a win, whether it's enjoying it with people or doing something or buying myself something that I wouldn't buy myself.
- I think there's a very fine line on guys saying stuff because you don't want to be disrespectful. That's not the point of it. But you also do need to - there's nothing wrong with saying what's on your mind.
- Yeah, the only time I'm finally rooting for someone is when I'm in the clubhouse and I'm done and they're out there playing and have a chance to win.

- It's a lot harder to rack up a big bill on clothes and shoes than on boats and cars.
- It doesn't matter how close I am with someone - I want to beat them so bad that they want to quit golf.
- And I think the most important thing is I never am or at least I hope to never be disrespectful.
- My attitude is good because I'm a fierce competitor and I have all the confidence in the world that I can beat everybody else. That's my attitude.
- I feel like people often say I am not good at controlled shots or hitting it low, and I feel I'm very good at it, just don't need to use it as often.
- But I do always want to be honest, because if you have something in your head that you would like changed or that you think some way, then, I mean, I'm not going to sit up here and be a robot and lie to you. It's not fair to you, it's not fair to me.
