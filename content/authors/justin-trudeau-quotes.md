- When I get passionate or worked up about an issue, I say things that the Conservatives and opponents and critics like to pounce on.
- The federal government's role is to establish a process whereby industry can pitch a project, and Canadians can be reassured that this project is worth the risk.

- I am so proud of my family, and I am happy to give them all the limelight they want because heaven knows I got more than I need.
- Canadians are tired of being cynical.
- A Canadian on the ground in different parts of the world, whether they're a diplomat, an aid worker, or a soldier, has an extraordinary, powerful impact.
- In 2012, the Liberal Party affirmed overwhelmingly at the policy convention that we are a pro-choice party. It means that we are a party that defends women's rights, and therefore, it would be inconsistent for any Liberal MP to be able to vote to take away women's rights.

- There is no debate about whether or not climate change is happening. We will deal with it as a challenge. But we also take it as an opportunity to invest.
- For me, being able to engage with the details when necessary, when there's a challenge, when there's a particularly important pivot, yes, you have to do that. But in general, a leader needs to trust their commanders, needs to trust the team they've assembled, to actually execute in the right way.

- CBC has a very important mandate to bind Canada together in both official languages, tell local stories, and make sure we have a sense of our strength, our culture, our stories.
- One of the jokes among our family was that whenever Dad went to the movies, he insisted on getting his senior citizen's discount. It was laughable to view him as a traditional senior citizen; he was one of the most robust people I ever knew. Until, very suddenly, he wasn't.

- One of the challenges that Vancouver and cities across the country are facing is that we don't have a federal partner in terms of building for transit, not in the way we need.

- One of the things that we have to realize is we cannot get off gas, we cannot get off oil, fossil fuels tomorrow - it's going to take a few decades. Maybe we can shorten it, but there's going to have to be a transition time.

- It's important that people understand who I am and where I come from and not just have it shaped by purely political discourse.
- Politicians are constantly stuck between what is politically expedient and politically beneficial and what is the responsible or right thing to do. It's a tension we all go through.

- Quite frankly, I talk about the fact that I'm a feminist as often as I can, and every time I do, it gets huge reaction, and media reacts, and the Twitterverse explodes and things like that, because here I am saying I'm a feminist. I will keep saying that until there is no more reaction to that when I say it, because that's where we want to get to.
- When I get out across the country and listen to people, the resentment that I see and the frustration that I see is that we have a generation of people who are fairly convinced that their kids are not going to have a better quality of life or a better future than they will.
- We need to make sure that everyone's pulling their weight and doing their fair share. Canadians get that, including the wealthy Canadians I talk to.
- The federal government shouldn't be drawing lines on a map in terms of what transit infrastructure are needed; we should be there to be a partner with the cities, with the provinces, that need that.
- I sort of locked into the idea that if I could be the perfect son to both of my parents, well maybe that would be enough to keep them together. And ultimately, obviously, it wasn't. Regardless of what I tried to do. That was a lesson about limitations.
- I think that Canadians in general very much understand... that we need to engage in the world and stand up for human rights.
- I think Canadians have always been interested in the choices Americans make because the choices you make inevitably impact upon us... and how we make sure that we get that balance right between continuing to have a good relationship and standing for the things we believe in is what we expect of ourselves.
- We know that trade, NAFTA, the free and open trade between Canada and the U.S. creates millions of good jobs on both sides of the border.
- Promising something that seems popular at the time that you know you're never going to deliver - that's the kind of cynical politics that I don't want any part of.
- I have nothing against wealth; I believe that government has a role to play in creating it by supporting pro-growth policies. However, success comes with responsibility.
- As soon as you're locking doors, you're narrowing your circle. And your circle gets smaller and smaller until it's finally just yourself and your buddy and you've got no one to party with.
- Withdrawing support from globalization is taking us in the wrong direction.
- I'm not going to reduce the choices of Canadians at the ballot box by backroom deals or secret arrangements. I think that's a cause for cynicism more than anything else.
- I think people are looking at Canada and realizing we're a place that is building for the long term and where the world's going to be.
- Can I actually make a difference? Can I get people to believe in politics once again? Can I get people to accept more complex answers to complex questions? I know I can. I know that's what I do very well.

- Our child benefit goes directly to the families who need it the most.
- I have no fears that on a purely merit basis, we will have an embarrassment of riches from which to choose in order to reach gender parity.
- The fact is Canadians understand that immigration, that people fleeing for their lives, that people wanting to build a better life for themselves and their kids is what created Canada, it's what created North America.
- Ours was not a normal or easy life.
- I think Canadians want to get a feel for the people who will serve them... and, for me, I think that Canadians will trust people who trust them.
- One of the things with Canada is we're of a modest enough size that we never feel that the ideal outcome of any given deal is, we win and you lose.
- I've made the commitment to Canadians that I'm going to stay myself, and I'm going stay open about it, and I'm going to make sure that the thoughtfulness with which I approach issues continues to shine through.
- My mom has always been so generous and so sensitive and so vulnerable and yet exudes so much strength.
- I had to learn to dismiss people who would criticize me based on nothing, but I also had to learn not to believe the people who would compliment me and think I was great based on nothing. And that led me to have a very, very strong sense of myself and my strengths.
- It's always easy to look at either the politics of division or fear as effective tools in politics, but ultimately, even though they can be effective tools to help you get elected, they hinder your ability to actually get the job of building a better future for this country, for this community, done.
- I think Canada has a great story, and I'm glad to tell it. And if there's a moment where the world is paying a little more attention to Canada, well, I think it's important to try and capitalize on that.
- I have no regrets.
- I think growing an economy is a good way to help with a deficit, but ultimately, it's about fiscal discipline and responsible spending - and smart decisions.
- Throughout our history, Canada's immigration policy has brought people here who had a pathway to citizenship. They were - and are - nation builders. It has been supported by political parties of all stripes and promoted by successive governments over generations.
- Liberals will continue to put forward positive solutions that will help our economy grow and give all Canadians a real and fair chance at success.
- When my father died, I had millions of people supporting me in a very, very difficult time. I have received so much from this country. I realize that we're defined in life not by what we get from this world but by what we have to offer it, and I know that I have a lot to offer this country, and I'm serious about devoting my life to it.
- I have been incredibly lucky all my life. I've had a family that has loved me and given me incredible opportunities. I've gone to great schools. I've travelled across the country.
- I believe it is wrong for Canada to follow the path of countries who exploit large numbers of guest workers, who have no realistic prospect of citizenship. It is bad for our economy in that it depresses wages for all Canadians, but it's even worse for our country.
- A Canadian is a Canadian is a Canadian. And you devalue the citizenship of every Canadian in this place and in this country when you break down and make it conditional for anyone.
- I am a teacher. It's how I define myself. A good teacher isn't someone who gives the answers out to their kids but is understanding of needs and challenges and gives tools to help other people succeed. That's the way I see myself, so whatever it is that I will do eventually after politics, it'll have to do a lot with teaching.
- People in the street will either call me 'Prime Minister' or 'Justin.' We'll see how that goes. But when I'm working, when I'm with my staff in public, I'm 'Prime Minister.' I say that if we're drinking beer out of a bottle, and you can see my tattoos, you should be comfortable calling me 'Justin.'
- Who cares about winning? We should focus on serving.
- I am in politics because every day, I get to work to make the world a little better - for my kids and for yours.
- Income splitting is a cynical policy, designed by a tired government short on ideas, now reheating old concoctions as their next campaign policy menu.
- You can't run a government from one single person. What instead matters is that leadership be about gathering around extraordinary individuals and getting the best out of them.
- What I was raised with in terms of a call to service was just a sense that I was lucky.
- As a prime minister, my job is not to try and influence or opine on what a leader of a different country should be doing.
- My father, his values were anchored in the time, but they were also timeless, whether it's bilingualism, multiculturalism or the charter of rights and freedoms.
- We need to make sure we're all working together to change mindsets, to change attitudes, and to fight against the bad habits that we have as a society.
