- It's funny, because when I went down to the combine for the interviews with teams, Charles Haley is the name that came up a lot as a comparison to the way I play. A lot of people said that I reminded them of him, and that's a great honor.
- For me, I'm lucky to have a lot of close friends - through football or through my family.
- You have to be equal at both - great at football and great at dedicating yourself to the academics at Notre Dame. It's hard. There are no rooty-toot classes for athletes in South Bend.
- I know what I need to work on; I know my weaknesses, but I have that work ethic to improve every day. I have that want to be the best player at my position, and I have the belief in myself that one day that will come true.
- I love black diamonds. They say your watch or jewelry wasn't cheap, but they aren't too flashy and in your face.
- I was pretty much seen as a basketball player coming out of high school. Football was my second love, but luckily, I turned out to be pretty good. Something just drew me to football; besides, I ended up being too short for my position in basketball.
- I used to like cufflinks, but I got too lazy for them. I realized I don't need them for a polished tailoring look, so more times than not, I skip them.
- We're all brought up to believe that the best players show up in the biggest games, and what bigger game than the Super Bowl? I've just been blessed and very lucky to have two of my best games on that stage.
- New York is a great place to be if you want to make an impact and be involved in charities or philanthropic organizations like my wife and I are.
- Any time you have defensive ends going above you in the draft, when you know you put up numbers that were equal to better, you just have to use that as motivation. Whenever you're the underdog, you have to have the right attitude and just go out there and be yourself; just play.
- There's a difference between playing hurt and playing injured.
- As long as I feel the love of the game and my health is good, I'm going to play. I don't want to be one of these guys who stays too long or regrets leaving early. Football has been great to me.
- I'd rather have 10 Super Bowl trophies and no MVPs.
- God has a plan for everybody's life, so there was obviously a reason why He wanted me to go to Notre Dame. Everything happens for a reason.
- I just want to continue to play great football - that's all that matters. I don't really care about the accolades or any of that.
- Everything to me is about team football, and if we keep winning Super Bowl trophies, I'll be fine.
- I love rings, but I can't wear them. I mean, look at my knuckles. My fingers and joints are so swollen from years of playing. That means no wedding band, either. Luckily, I have a very understanding wife.
