- Figure out what you do the most in your day, then put your money toward those kinds of clothes. If I'm spending a big part of my day driving my kids to and from preschool, I'll buy loungewear or workout clothes that I feel good in.
- That's what I love doing - finding ways to make a personality as extreme as you can before it starts to get goofy.
- I feel like people only want to hear me say funny things. Like, I don't tweet about my kids or being a mom, ever, because I'm very aware that that's annoying for people to hear.
- Being mean just for being mean's sake isn't funny.
- Junior high and elementary school, those girls were so, so mean to me.
- With any show, when fans come up to you, they assume you're just like your character.
- I love football.
- Breaking is when someone starts to laugh in the middle of a scene, which is so fun to watch.
- I'm not really the sex symbol type.
- The greatest relationships are often the unexpected ones.
- The funniest people I know were, not necessarily troubled, but had a harder time in school or were shy or picked on or something like that. I think that you rely on it. 'Well, I don't think I'm cute and no one wants to hang out with me - I'd better start trying to make people laugh.' I think there's an element of that in there.
- I think people think of Oregon as such a granola, hippie kind of a place.
- It would be great to do another television show that was a multi-camera because the hours are so wonderful and you can be a good mom at the same time. The problem is, there aren't a lot of multi-camera shows that I personally like. My aesthetic is more geared toward single-camera shows.
- I'd just like to be good at sports. I'm extremely competitive with absolutely nothing to back it up.
- I was really shy.
- I liked making people laugh. I remember that specifically, being really young and having my parents being in the audience and laughing. It wasn't really a 'Oh, I'm the center of attention' feeling; it was more 'Oh, I'm making them so happy right now' feeling. I liked that.
- Sometimes, I find that just the simplest, cleanest things that are intelligently performed are funniest to me.
- When I post anything at all on Instagram or Twitter, I get hundreds and hundreds of 'shut up' after I say anything. But it's all out of love.
- You can take anything, and if you explore it right, you can make it funny.
- I trained at The Groundlings and was surrounded by some very funny women and also some very unfunny men. I didn't feel a sense of things being different because I was a girl.
- My children have trained me well for multitasking.
- I love 'Overboard!' That's such a great movie, and it's one of the first movies where it co-stars a man and a woman, and they are both equally funny. That's a very rare thing.
- I have always admired people who are comfortable not being liked because I am the opposite of that. To the point when I was little, it was crippling.
- I'm very attracted to comedy I don't see coming.
- On 'Sunny,' the main actors are adults, and we're all friends, and we all have the same sense of humor, so there's a lot of improvising.
- In 'Finding Dory,' I play a whale shark named Destiny who can't swim very well. We're both extremely clumsy!
- On 'The Mick' we want to make the funniest family show possible, but maybe pushing the boundaries of which family members you want to be watching - some kids will be too young for it.
- I was really shy and kept to the theater department. I was keeping my eyes down when I walked through the halls. So, no nemesis. Not in high school, anyway.
- I'm drawn to the funny brand of comedy.
- Before 'Sunny' came along, I would audition and do chemistry reads with very funny actors. And then they would cast someone who was beautiful and benign. I don't think that very funny men wanted to headline with very funny women. They wanted to be the funny ones, and they wanted the wife to be the wife. That was very frustrating.
- You know, I have the best parents in the world and I got really, really lucky because they think that everything I do is Oscar-worthy.
- Carol Burnett, Gilda Radner, and Julia Louis-Dreyfus are my comedic influences. I like a lot of dudes, too, like Bill Murray and Will Ferrell.
- I got lucky: I love my in-laws.
- I'm never going to understand what Middle America wants, because I'm on a show that Middle America doesn't necessarily like but I think is really funny.
- I'd do a really good job playing Trisha Yearwood.
- I like playing these characters who are just on the edge of ridiculous but always grounded in reality. I would never want to come across as a cartoon.
- On 'Sunny,' we're not trying to be a family show. We're literally trying to make the funniest show possible.
- When I was 12, I introduced my mom to Def Leppard's 'Pour Some Sugar on Me.' I told her it was an amazing song, and I remember her not really agreeing with me.
