- It's been neat to find out different writing strategies. I've been in the room with so many different writers. Sometimes, you write with tracks, and other times, with acoustic guitars. That's been really a cool thing, because it brings out different lyrics with you.

- My music-making process is pretty fun and easy.
- I realized everything my mom had done for me: Anything we didn't have, she made sure we had.

- Growing up, we really didn't have a lot of money.

- I just want to help people, especially with the platform I'm on. I try and help people as much as possible.
- People always say, 'There are plenty of black country artists out there! There is Charley Pride! Darius Rucker!' That's all they can name. They don't understand what we go through, and a lot of people who are fans of traditional country music, as they call it, look at us and aren't going to say, 'Y'all like country music.'
- Everybody's got high expectations for me. I just don't want to let anybody down.
- I was kind of nervous to put 'Learning' out: it's a lot different. That's who I am. I'm going to push the boundaries.
- I always like to appreciate any achievement but then try and figure out how to top that the next time.
- I learned that my upbringing was rough, but there's other people out there where their upbringing is even worse than mine. It just gives you even more of a reason to want to help.

- Hopefully I can help kids, and they can end up being stronger in the long run, too.

- I just want people to know that they can make it through hard times like I did.
- A lot of people say I inspire them or I've helped them - kids who have been bullied in school or parents coming up to me because their kids have been bullied or anything that they've went through. It really touches me.
- That's something that I never thought I would have in a million years. We've done Gold before with 'Used To Love You Sober,' which I thought was awesome, but you don't realize once you get to Platinum, and you see the number difference between 500,000 and a million.

- Everyone should have equal opportunities and equal rights, but you can't even have an opinion without somebody going off on you. That's what's wrong with this world today.
- I wanted to call it 'Experiment' because it's all kinds of different sounds. We have a bunch of instruments on there that are basically going extinct, like the fiddle, the steel guitar, the slide.
- I just want my hometown talking about where I'm going - like, 'He's killin' it right now,' and, 'I'm so glad he's doin' well,' and I want them to know I'll always come back, every chance I get. I'm not one of those people who'll just leave.

- I feel like everything happens for a reason.

- I just feel like I have a chance to be a role model now.
- My nana was a detective; my nana was a great cop. You also have bad cops that were bullied in school or whatever and think that they have power, and that makes other cops look bad.
- I know that sounds weird, but I always compete with myself. If I do something, I always look at a chart and say I can do better the next week.

- If you come to my shows, there's all kinds of different races, all kinds of different people.
- On my posts, I would tell people, 'If you like this, give it a share.' If you go online and look at my videos, you might see where I have 80,000 likes, but 525,000 shares. That's where you gain more people as followers coming in. It took me a second to learn it all, but now that I have, it's been a blessing and a curse.
- A lot of people that only like country music, they're not fans of mine.
- I'm not a mean person, so it kind of hurts when people are mean to me, but that's life.

- I just like to see people smile.
- I try to stay away from all negativity.

- I was on the road with my buddy Alex - he's my guitar player - and we watched the movie 'Click' by Adam Sandler. And I don't know why, but me and him just got in our feelings. And then we ended up calling our girls, and we were like, 'We're so sorry. We wish you were here!'
- My first impression when I heard 'Heaven' was, 'Do not let anyone else have that song! I'm putting it on hold.' I knew it was special from the first time I heard it, and I thought my fans would love it as much as I did.
- Nobody deserves to be bullied.
- The thing people see about me is my tattoos more than anything, but the color aspect does not help.
- I kept my circle small. I had my friends that I knew wouldn't do anything to hurt me, and I would also stand up for them, and those are still my friends today.
- I feel like I should show people that no matter where you come from - you can get beat by your stepdad, if you get picked on for your clothes and having no money - I just feel like everyone should know it will be all right as long as you keep focusing on trying to move forward and looking at the positive things in life.
- I used to isolate myself and be in my room by myself all the time.
