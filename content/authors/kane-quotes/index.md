- If it hadn't been for Paul Bearer, there would not have been a Kane. For that, I'm forever grateful.

- I think the great thing about the WWE universe is that they just love to see us perform.
- I think, as Republicans, we need to stick by what we believe in. And that is fiscal conservatism and individual freedom.

- The politician is your best friend - he always wants to be there when he's asking for your vote. But then, often, he doesn't have time for you when he gets into office. To me, it's the opposite. They should listen to you more when they're actually in office.
- I used to play 'Halo 2' and 'Ghost Recon' online quite a bit.
- Wrestling is a lot like any other workplace. You don't really talk religion or politics. But we are all independent contractors, so we pay our taxes quarterly. And we talk about taxes.
- I have always taken everything as it comes and tried to stay in good shape.
- At the federal level, as a member of Congress, you have one vote out of 435, and in the Senate, it's one out of 100. So, the ability to get some stuff done exists as a much larger opportunity at a local level than in the federal government.
- I was playing college football, and I hurt my knee very badly my senior year, and I didn't want to get a real job.
- Getting to work with The Undertaker right off the bat was a tremendous opportunity. It was an opportunity to be a career-maker, and fortunately, I was able to take advantage of that.
- I was taught, growing up, that there are two ends of the political spectrum: left and right. But there's so much more than that. For me, it's about liberty versus authoritarianism.
- The federal government gets a lot press, and that's what the media talks about, but your state and local governments, in many ways, have more impact on your life than the federal government does.
- All of us are born with certain gifts, and the secret to success is figuring out what your gift is and using it in a way that benefits others.
- Kane dons the mask because he is horribly disfigured, unstable, mentally insane and crazy, so I thought it would basically look like he had escaped from an institution. Then, I get the creative for the costume, and it looked like a superhero.
- When I think about it, 20 years really seems like a blink of an eye sometimes. I wish I would have made a more concerted effort to enjoy things along the way.

- Kane has always been sort of a dark character.
- In the end, Kane will be remembered as a character I played on TV. In that respect, I want people to remember me for more than that.
- I've been in WWE for 22 years and reached a point in my career where, within the locker room, I'm one of the people that guys come to if something needs to be discussed. I'm also one of the people that the WWE executives, if there is a problem in the locker room, I'm one people that is consulted about that.
- Employment is a contract between an employer and an employee. Thus, laws prohibiting discriminatory pay are an infringement on private contracts.

- I was a little nervous at my first match, but I think I did OK. I went home after the match and watched the tape of it over and over. I wanted to do it again.
- I believe, in America, we're a nation of people that are self-governors. This idea that only a chosen few elites have the ability to make decisions is foreign to me.
- There are people a lot smarter, a lot more talented than I am, people who've accomplished things I can only imagine. Often, they started from the most humble of circumstances. That's my message: freedom and opportunity. That's the American Dream.
- People ask what the advantages are of wearing a mask, and the first thing, of course, is the mystery - people don't know exactly what Kane is thinking.
- By mandating equal pay, the government erases the competitive advantage of those people who are willing to take less pay. In addition, employers are less willing to hire employees who they believe could subject them to increased liability.

- I would consider myself a Reagan Republican.
- If you look at guys like Shawn Michaels, Triple H, and Undertaker, the reason why they are around so long is because they keep things interesting, and hopefully, I have been able to do it as well.

- In my primary, I only won by 23 votes in that one, so every vote really does count, and I want to make sure I get as many as I possibly can.

- I sweat a lot.
- We've all heard the phrase 'equal pay for equal work.' Many of those who habitually repeat this mantra may not realize that it is simply a variation of the discredited labor theory of value (LTV), which is generally associated with Marxian economics.
- People all the time come up and ask how we do this or how we do that, and there isn't any secret to it. You're just getting bashed with something, and you're either a man and you take it, or you're not. People don't realize the toughness of WWE superstars.
- I've always been interested in politics.
- I think it's incumbent upon elected officials to make sure that, if we're going to demand more tax money from people, that we use it in a productive manner and not just say, 'This is what we're going to use it for,' and then they find out that it was used for something else and sometimes something very frivolous.

- I was very active in college. I wanted to play athletics, and then I looked at wrestling as being a viable option to do that.
- I think one of the things that will really surprise people about 'See No Evil 2' is the fact that its so beautifully shot. It's really a pretty movie.
- I'm not a big fan of spiders and snakes and worms and stuff like that, but they don't really creep me out.
- Control freak politicians never rest, and a few of the more dedicated ones are working relentlessly to slap chains on the world's most unfettered market. The Marketplace Fairness Act will end up forcing consumers to pay higher prices for the goods they desire.
- Pursue your dreams but have a backup plan.
- I'm as far outside of the mainstream political establishment as you can get.
- The horror genre is real cathartic. It allows us to bring out the things that scare us and get it out and have an emotional release.
- I grew up in rural Missouri about two hours north of St. Louis, and if the wind was blowing right on a Saturday night, I could catch All Star Wrestling out of Kansas City, which was run by Bob Geigel, and some of the stars there were Bulldog Bob Brower and Ray Candy.
- I'm not worried about a 'blue wave,' I just think Republicans have to act like Republicans and govern like Republicans.
- I've always been happy about what's gone on in my career. It's been tremendous: more than I can ever hope for.
- I believe that the Kane/Undertaker story, if you look at epic storytelling like Greek mythology, that is what it is. It is the best piece of epic storytelling that the WWE has ever done.
- I just want to do a good job as mayor.
- The horror genre is probably my favorite genre along with psychological thrillers.
- Freddy Krueger was one of my childhood heroes.
- I think what The Rock has been able to accomplish has been amazing. He has just done a phenomenal job in all of the movies he has been in.

- My biggest moment was me beating Stone Cold Steve Austin to win the championship.
- TSA is such low-hanging fruit. I mean, anybody can bash the TSA.
- What we do in WWE is not a sacrifice. Being out on the road all the time, and all the bumps and bruises, that sort of thing is difficult but also a joy and a pleasure. It's brought so much happiness into my life. I wouldn't have it any other way.
- I think sometimes we put blinders on and define our personas very narrowly and are afraid to step outside the comfort zone - something I've never been afraid to do.
- Just like everyone else, I was a big fan of Paul Bearer and Percy Pringle and all of the other names that he went by.
- Honestly, I think we in the WWE are very underrated as performers. What we do would be very difficult for even an experienced actor. To go out and sometimes have 15 minutes of verbiage, sometimes have to ad-lib and then, of course, have other variables such as the interaction with the audience, it can be challenging.
- Anyone who's been in the WWE for an extended period of time has to be able to do different things. Eventually, a character gimmick is going to get old and stale. And, when it does, if that's all you can do, you're done.
- Basically, I'm a fiscal conservative.
- I'm not always the guy getting knocked down a whole lot. My body probably hasn't been punished as much as the other guys have been. I think it's because I show up every day, and I try to do my best - give everything I have.
- Anyone that watches WWE realizes a lot of times we do big stuff. We're considered over the top.

- The thing about WWE that is so awesome is the global reach.
- I've been very fortunate that I haven't gotten injured a bunch. I try to take care of myself. I think, too, my size gives me an advantage in some ways.
- I think the key to the longevity is being able to reinvent yourself and to adopt and incorporate different things into your character.
- Social studies was my favorite subject. I remember I portrayed Walter Mondale in a mock debate in my sophomore social studies class.
- When you ask someone for their vote, you are asking them to place their confidence in you as the steward of the community, so it was humbling that people placed their faith and trust in me.
- The role in 'See No Evil,' Jacob Goodnight, was perfect for me, so if I got the opportunity to do that again, I certainly would consider that.
- Knox County, Tennessee, is a great place to live, work, and raise a family.
- For someone my size, it's difficult to be inconspicuous.
- I would definitely say the WWE superstars are underrated athletically. In fact, that's one of the things that always attracted me to wrestling.
- You can't make everyone happy. You just do what you can, and that's it... you're always going to catch criticism no matter what you do.
