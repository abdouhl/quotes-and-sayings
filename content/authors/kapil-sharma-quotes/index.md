- I grew up thinking that I would become a fighter pilot and was fascinated by aircrafts as I had grown up around that. But my father encouraged me to not become an Air Force person, given the varied interests I had, be it books, movies, sports or fighter flying.
- I am an Air Force brat who grew up at various Air Force bases. I changed six schools in about five years and got stability for the first time when I was sent to a boarding school, Rishi Valley. I lived outside of a cantonment-style living and was among an eclectic mix of kids and got exposed to books and other things.

- When I see that things are not going the way they should be, I just clam up.
- I used to feel that I wouldn't be able to marry, since I am not a responsible person. I love two things - my work and music.

- One can do a film and not work for six months, but on TV, you have to produce good content every week. It involves a lot of hard work, as one has to fight for ratings every week. But I have always got love from the audiences, be it during 'The Great Laughter Challenge' or 'Comedy Circus.'
- People expect comedy from me but I am not just a stand-up comedian anymore. I act on stage, host 'Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa' and also conduct interviews on my show. I have grown as a person and an artiste.
- I left home to become a singer and didn't realise when I turned comedian.
- People tell me that my appearance in real life is better than on-screen. Perhaps people think I am exactly like the characters I play on TV.
- I am always scared before going on stage; this is the fear which makes me do well.
- My style is an extension of acting and an outcome of some serious lessons I picked up learning when I did theatre in my early days.
- It's not easy for an outsider to understand this industry.
- I love eggs, particularly omelettes, and can eat anda-pav at any time of the day.
- Simple things make me very happy.

- I remember how difficult it was to resist the food served on the sets of a movie directed by Abbas and Mustan. They love food, and I could not resist digging into their dabba for some wonderful meals.
- I used to do a lot of serious theatre during my school and college days. Comedy was only reserved for youth festival and inter-college competitions. Then once 'The Great Indian Laughter Challenge' was launched, a regional channel in Punjab started a program based on that. I participated in it and emerged as the winner.
- On December 24, 2016, I called and told Ginni that I wanted to marry her. My mother has always been fond of her.

- I have received so much love from people. Why will I feel insecure? I am happy.
- My work is my worship, and that's what means the most to me.
- It was a unique childhood, to say the least. My father was born in Patiala to refugee parents and was a part of the Indian Air Force. The talented few amongst the Air Force pilots are made test pilots. Test pilots are best suited to look at the space programme as they are trained to expect the unexpected.
- People think I am funny all the time. But I am not. I am serious, too. Also, I enjoy serious, dramatic films.
