- It is important to be well read, at least a little bit.
- If I want to kiss, I shall kiss. If I am told that a lovemaking scene is integral to the script, I will consider it.
- I do my own thing. And I believe what I do is the right thing.
- I don't take success and failure seriously. The only thing I do seriously is march forward. If I fall, I get up and march again.
- I am passionate about acting. 'Girls in our family are not allowed to act' is quite an outdated thought to have. They did it till my mother, but now no more.
- My thinking is lot more different with many actresses in the industry. I don't understand why people in showbiz put their profession of acting in the back seat after marriage.
- I don't know why people feel that I am snooty. I am not a person who has ever given an interview on image building. I have never been that person, as I am very confident of what I do. People do PR, but I get completely foxed. I don't know how to do it. I stay away from the limelight, as I think my work should speak on my behalf.
- Life is full of happiness and tears; be strong and have faith.
- My professional life has nothing to do with my personal life and vice versa.
- Yoga may look peaceful and calming, but even Arnold Schwarzenegger would have trouble breathing after twenty 'surya namaskars' in a row.
- In 2007, my life changed forever. I signed on 'Tashan,' a full-on glamorous masala movie, with two of the hottest and fittest actors around: Akshay Kumar and Saif Ali Khan. And me, rising out of the sea like a Bond girl, wearing nothing but a green bikini. I had nightmares of how my love handles would be on display for the whole world to see.
- Films don't decide my whole life. They are just a part of who I am. What I do in my personal life should be of no concern to the filmmakers or the fans.
- I started my career with 'Refugee' in Bhuj. Now, it has become a full-fledged city.
- I believe in the institution of marriage and it's like a tag to cement the relationship for your friends, family and public.
- 'Heroine' is about a declining and imbalanced superstar - a very brave and bold role. I wanted to test whether I could carry a role like this. I have given 200 per cent to this role. She's a very complex character, very aggressive, manipulative and bold, yet she's very fragile.
- I am not a home breaker and I can never be. I haven't been brought up to create havoc in other people's homes.
- One should eat everything especially healthy and not junk food. I don't like the idea of starving. I would eat and burn it out in gym. The amount of intake is what matters.
- I want a man I can keep for myself. I wouldn't ever share my man with anyone else.
- My co-stars call me selfish. They say, 'You are only interested in yourself and what you are only interested is yourself and what you are doing in front of the camera.' I reply, 'I can't help it; it's what got me where I am.'
- 'Ek Main Aur Ek Tu' was a very special film for me. Imran and we complement each other very well. He is sugar, and I am spice.
- I eat only simple Indian home food - sabzi, roti, dal, chawal, ghee. There are so many benefits of having ghee. My grandmother is 84 and she is still fit and looks beautiful.
- Actors are greedy. They can never be satisfied. I want praise as well as box office returns.
- I never really do much research before signing a film. It is just the script and character that I concentrate on.
- Be it a village or a city, education is very important, and it always comes into you.
- It's unarguable that the right shoes can really add elegance to an outfit and to the person who's wearing them. Take a pair of high heels, for instance. Suddenly, you're looking taller, shoulders back, body curved.
- My parents are very modern. My father is a cosmopolitan person. He always supported the fact that I will be an actress. There is nothing else I would do rather than being an actor.
- Frankly, we actresses are so much in a hurry. We feel we have very few years to shine in our career, so we neglect our personal life. But for me, both aspects are equally important. I don't want to grow old and have regrets.
- I think a woman looks best in a sari.
- It's a political and manipulative industry. Actors vie for the same roles, movies are snatched away. Have I ever been manipulated? Yes. But I haven't manipulated anyone because if you think from the heart, you cannot be calculative. I have spent nights crying.
- You are as old as you look. If you are fit and pretty at an X age, why won't filmmakers want to cast you, whether you are married or not?
- Once, in a magazine interview, I said the difference between shoe ladies and bag ladies is that shoe ladies are just a bit classier. Finished! That started World War III among all the women I knew. I only meant that shoes do more for your look and body than bags do!
- A lot of guys try to mingle with me because of who I am. If I encounter a guy with a clean heart, I will go by my instincts. I guess my man won't be from the film industry.
