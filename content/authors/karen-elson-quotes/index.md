- I think Jennifer Lawrence is a brilliant role model for young girls, not some of the models that I see on the runway.
- At some hotels, I feel like I have to be dressed to the nines - perfectly eccentric - to walk out the door.
- I constantly have a devil on my shoulder telling me that what I'm doing is really horrible, and then somehow the lightning strike happens, and everything comes together.
- Even though I have lived in the States since I was 18, in my head I am still very British, and I do have this romance for towns in Middle America that nobody gets to see.
- As a model, I am at the mercy of everybody else. It's much more of a situation where I go to work, put the clothes on, get in front of the camera, and then go home. But in that process, I never really have control over any of it.
- I feel like somehow I'm living my life mentally in reverse. It's taken me to my 30s to feel relaxed and comfortable in my skin. I think I'm going to be dancing on tables when I'm 50. I really hope I am.
- Trends come and go, and style evolves. It's important to have pieces of jewelry that are timeless and look chic despite ever-changing fashions.
- Research on the Internet, research what people say about the vintage stores, look online to see if customer service is good because that's really important. Also to see online what other customers say.

- If a model is going to make some shoes, she's going to make them comfortable.
- I had a diary full of lyrics and whatnot and a little voice recorder of guitar riffs.
- I love Jen Meyer - she's a dear friend, and Tabitha Simmons as well.
- I feel Dress for Success is basically about empowering women who were in a disadvantaged situation. The act of wearing a suit when she's walking in the door, it's so powerful - it's about gaining control of their lives and situations.
- I've been in a New York City-based cabaret for the past seven years called The Citizens Band. It's possibly one of the most brilliant things I've ever been involved with.
- I tend to sort of over-accessorize, but to feel empowered, I strip it all down and become minimal so that it's almost counterintuitive.
- I've been writing songs since I was at least 20. That's what I wanted to do before I became a model.
- I was always the weirdo at school.
- I'm a fan of creating the mood and vibe with flowers, candles, and music. I love making my guests feel like it's not formal and they can relax in my home.
- The interesting thing with fashion is that it's really a massive daydream.
- I am obsessed with the Great Depression and with former showgirls - and the Victorians - the idea of wistful, dark romance.
- Think about your menu, and if you're not a skilled chef - which I'm not - follow a recipe. You can't go wrong if you don't cut the fine print.
- I would go home and be this insular girl who listened to music and brooded in her bedroom.
- It's time to give back; you know, I've lived in this beautiful world of fashion for so long, and it's time to really get my hands dirty and get in the trenches and see the world for what it really is.
- I don't want my children to ever think that food is taboo.
- You don't just wake up one morning and decide to become a singer-songwriter.
- As scary as it is, I like making real, direct eye contact with people from the stage. In a sense, it's like modeling: that feeling of locking in and projecting some kind of emotion to try to captivate people.
- If I wasn't a model, I would never have been around interesting musicians, even had the financial capabilities to say, 'I don't have to work right now. I can sit and make my record.'
- It's just this huge sense of relief I have with myself right now... It took me to be 31 to go, 'Wow, I'm really happy being a model.'
- I like those stories that capture the brutality of life, but there's still some kind of melancholy romance.
- There was this moment, particularly after I had my first child, where I felt like, 'I don't know if I'll ever make a record, or if this is always going to be something just floating around in my head.'
- I knew I had more in me than just standing up and having my picture taken... Being in the studio, I have to have an opinion.
- I am a woman. I go on set, and I'll be who I am, and I'll represent who I am. I think it comes with age.
- Being a model, you're always the product of somebody else's vision.
- I was always singing as a kid. That's honestly all I've ever wanted to do.
