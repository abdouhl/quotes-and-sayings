- How do you create chemistry? If only I knew that! Some people say it's a natural thing that you have with someone, and maybe it is to do with that, but I think you can work on it.
- I don't like modeling, but in terms of the places I got to visit, it was great.
- I was one of those weird children that just couldn't talk to people, so I kind of had to make myself be not like that because I knew it was going to hinder me.
- Acting is all about finding the truth within whatever world you're in.
- I'd like to make over Marilyn Manson and just dress him really normally to see what he looks like. That'd be really weird!

- My own fashion sense has been influenced by 'We'll Take Manhattan.' It's gotten a little better.
- I never cared about modeling. As a model, you're powerless.
- It's good to go with your gut instincts in life. You just should. Even if it doesn't work out, something good will come out of it.

- I had a lot of alone time with no brothers or sisters running around, or anything. I would just sit and imagine things, all the time.
- I just feel so flattered, because the cosplayers really make sure every detail is there. I don't think I've ever cosplayed a character before, but if I were to, I'd probably go as a Klingon from 'Star Trek.'
- I dyed my hair pink when I was fifteen.
- I want to be like Robin Williams, really. It's all the different characters he does, all the different voices.
- Space excites me. My dream is to go to space.
- I have no sense of being famous - you're just working. And then you'll have a random day in London when you'll do some press and it creeps into your awareness that this goes out - that what you do every day goes out to televisions right across the country.
- I know what it's like to be a model and go to castings where some people like what they see and others look at you with distaste.
- Basically, I always go to vintage shops rather than going shopping for new clothes.
- I wanted to be as authentic as possible because, first of all, Jean Shrimpton is still alive. And, she's interesting enough to be played accurately. I didn't need to add things.
- I would like to think I'm a good secret-keeper, when it comes to friends. I'm quite loyal like that.
- I suppose I am one of life's naturally clumsy people; I don't drop stuff all the time, or break things, but I'm just generally a bit flustered.
- I really love Alexa Chung's style. I really think she gets it right all the time. I've never seen a picture of her where I didn't love the outfit.
- Being in 'Doctor Who' has been so amazing. I don't think I will ever have a job quite so fun ever again. I feel sad because I am going to leave, but with any story, it has to come to an end.
