- Skating taught me to set a goal and to block out other things and just focus on this one thing.
- I hope that I can maintain my skating as long as possible.
- I never had a serious injury that kept me out of a big competition. Now everyone has injuries - to their feet or their knees or their backs.

- When you reach a certain level, you live in a bubble when all you think, dream and breathe is becoming the best athlete in the world.
- Sometimes I even now feel like a stranger in my country. But I knew there would be problems because I had seen the world as a skater. And now?

- Sometimes, success almost haunts you. You want to be the best at everything you do and know you have to work hard.
- The desire to really compete again has been there for a long time.
- It's not like I didn't do anything for 10 years and chose a new profession. I've been on the ice a lot. I'm not an outsider.
- I learned not to depend on other people. I needed support, but it's you who has to go out and deliver.
- As an athlete, you choose your sport and are drawn into it but your passion should never be driven by fame and fortune but a desire to create something special that people will always remember.
- I don't want to compete. I want to skate for the joy. I get so nervous in competition. I get always sick. I had pressures enough in my life from skating.
- I was the very first athlete in East Germany allowed to go professional.
- Money was never the motivation. It never should be in sports.
- When you're young, you don't think very far ahead. You just think in terms of the next day, the next week, the next competition. You don't think about injuries that could threaten your long-term health.
- Figure skating is a mixture of art and sport.
- I was an athlete. And I proved I didn't win just because I was pretty. I was good, too.
