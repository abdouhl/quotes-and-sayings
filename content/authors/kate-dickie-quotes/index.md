- I would love to study cultures and people.
- I turn into a crying, hysterical maniac when I see a spider. It's pathetic.
- I'm usually in jammies and slippers by 8 P.M.
- I've been angst-ridden all my life, but finally I'm in a place where things don't matter so much.
- I hate going into a room with people in it and the feeling of them staring. I find every moment excruciating.
- I don't feel drawn to lightness, I need something more. I feel that - oh, I hate saying this, it sounds so wanky - but I feel a real urge to give voices to people we don't usually hear from in real life.
- There are always reasons for people's behaviour, and it's easy just to dismiss them and assume that we already know their story, especially if they're no good at showing their emotions. Life gives you all these knocks, it's so easy to form a shell to protect yourself. I've done it myself.
