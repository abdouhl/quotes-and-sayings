- If you said, 'I'm giving up smoking,' people would put on a parade. If you said, 'I'm going to eat more healthily,' people would say, 'Good for you.' If it's drinking, the first reaction is, 'That's so boring. You're going to be so boring.'

- I am older than most of my on-screen colleagues, and the ones behind the scenes, too.
