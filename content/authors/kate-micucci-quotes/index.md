- I think that's what is so cool about performing. When there is a show to do, you get up there and do it.
- I guess one that wouldn't be obvious is - well, maybe it's super obvious, I can't tell - 'I Love Lucy' is my favorite show, going back to when I was 4. I've watched every episode I don't know how many times. It was something to watch women being funny when I was young.
- I thought 'Garfunkel and Oates' would be too confusing, but it ended up being confusing in the best of ways because the first time we played a comedy club, it was because they thought we were the real Garfunkel and Oates.
- I'm really shy - I don't do karaoke.
- I used to be obsessed with game shows. When the Game Show Network became popular in the late '90s, I was all about reruns of 'The Price Is Right.' I knew all the prices from the '70s.
- There was another Judy Garland movie on TV, and it wasn't 'The Wizard of Oz,' and I was so confused. I was like, 'Wait a second, what is Dorothy doing in this movie?' And that's when I became fascinated. I didn't realize there were actors.
- There was always that kind of imagination in our house, which was always a little crazy.
- There have been moments where I'm like, 'I don't know how I'm going to survive and pay next month's rent.' And the next month I'm filming a movie in New York City.

- I totally had OCD as a teenager. I used to have to touch all four sides of a picture frame when I got home from school and before I started to do my homework. It was time-consuming. But then I just outgrew it, though it sometimes comes back when I'm under a lot of stress.
- For me, I've always wanted to be a nun. I mean, I think about what it's like to be a nun. And I've always been fascinated with nuns, and I have a nun collection, I've been collecting nuns for 20 years. And I have a song that I wrote, 'I Wanna Be a Nun,' when I was 25.
- I babysat kids in a ShopRite, which is a grocery store. They had a babysitting center so that parents could bring their children while they shopped. It was awful. I also was not very good at keeping the kids calm.
- I've had times where I've joked, like, 'I'm going to move to Vermont and become a painter.' And sometimes that joke felt like, 'Oh that's a good idea.' But it was only, like, a daydream for a moment to, like, escape.
- At comedy festivals, we always get grouped with other musical comedians, so you can get to know them and see what everyone is doing. it's really fun and awesome that we're the only girls, because we can tackle issues that guys can't sing about.
- Near the end of high school, I was always super shy, backward.
- My brother and I did theater in high school, and were both in Pennsylvania Youth Theatre. It was awesome. When you go to Los Angeles, it's a rough city, and it's hard. You drive around in your car in your own little bubble, and there's tons of rejection. Being from the Lehigh Valley helped because it was something so stable.

- I really like doing puppetry; I'm not sure if it will find its way into 'Big Bang,' but it always does seem to find its way into a lot of things.

- When I have a bad show, I can't wait until I can get back on stage to forget about it.
- I started playing the ukulele in the year 2000. That sounds so futuristic saying it like that. The year 2000.
- I know a lot about Judy Garland. She was born in 1922, and I think she died in '69. When I was little, like, when I was 8, I knew all of her husbands' names.
- It's good to make your own things because you can have control of your own art.
