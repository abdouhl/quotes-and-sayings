- I have to remind myself constantly to not be antisocial, because I stay to myself a lot. I'm a lot more introspective than my characters.
- I loved the challenge of being able to take a character who could be thrown away as 'crazy' and making her identifiable to the audience - also, to give her a vulnerability that people would cheer for.
- I always have said from the beginning of my career that I was going for the 'Geek Trifecta' because I'm such a total geek. I want to be in everything that has to do with the things that I enjoyed when I was a kid, which was 'Battlestar Galactica,' and being in 'Big Bang Theory,' and being in video games.
- I think when you're doing good work, you don't necessarily need to be validated.
- Things that happen in Wyoming are things that wouldn't happen in a big city - we've got bears, we've got a lot of shotguns - in Absaroka County, everybody's got a shotgun in the back of their car!
- Of course I love the action. I absolutely love doing action movies; it's what makes me tick, but I think my dream role is a movie that Will Smith's company has called 'Paper Wings.'
- It's interesting: I've been doing this since I was 17, and it's kind of weird to see yourself grow up on television.
- I love playing these characters that are crazy tough, though. Because I am not in real life. Not at all.
- I still sleep with my baby blanket.
- I had a stalker break into my house a couple times. They didn't leave any fingerprints or take anything - I was being followed.
- I grew up as a fan of comic books, and I've been reading them for so long that I've never felt an affinity toward just one.
- I've seen 'Absentia,' which was amazing. I loved 'Absentia.' I loved that for no money, he was able to make a movie about something that you never saw. You never saw the bad guys. That was amazing to me. You never saw what you were supposed to be afraid of; you just knew you were supposed to be afraid of it. It was a phenomenal movie.
- The fight scenes are pretty easy and come pretty naturally for me, to be honest.
- Playing tough characters just comes easy for me. It's not who I am in real life, so I love going to work and pretending to be something I'm not. I love all the action and confidence. But when I finally go do a rom-com, I hope my fans will support me.
- I think that I am lucky and blessed to have the job that I have, and I am trying to create longevity. If that means that I transition into different things at different points in my life, then that's fine. I also believe that if doors don't open, make new doors, so I've also started producing quite a bit of things.
- I'm more of a thriller-horror fan - things that could really happen. I don't like scary movies, the 'Saw' movies scare the crap out of me - I think I've seen two of them and I wanted to go crawl in a hole.
- I love playing women, and I think that this is a throughline to a lot of the characters I've played - they all have this aspect of being wronged. And I think, a lot of the time, the characters are actually wronged by themselves, and they find someone else to blame it on.
- Seth Green, he and I are trying to figure out how this all came about. Because we don't remember what came first, the chicken or the egg, no pun intended. But I don't remember what came first, 'Robot Chicken' or our friendship, because we've known each other for so long.
- I've never really had the opportunity to play something that's a complete departure from me yet.
- There's a joke that, if you can ride through Texas with somebody, which is 700 miles of just straight, flat freeway riding, then you can be friends with them forever.
- I think that what made people accept Starbuck as a woman was that she was just such an interesting character. I think that once people put their guard down and their preconceived notions of what the show is supposed to be and just allowed it to really be good science fiction.
- I don't watch a lot of TV.
- I personally have not spoken to Marvel and have no plans to do a movie in the immediate future because, number one, I'm tied up with 'Somnia,' which is a fantastic place to be. It's exactly where I wanted to be.
- I'm a bit insane when it comes to doing my own stunts and getting down and dirty. It's fun, you know? It's things I wouldn't normally do in my real life, so when I go to work and get to beat people up and shoot guns and get waterboarded, those are things I find completely interesting.
- I've got my Peabody and my Saturn awards right next to each other on my mantle, and that is about it, and that is all that matters.
- There's a darkness to Riddick that I think allows people to want him to do bad things because you know Riddick is going to do bad things: that's just the way it is. But I think that at his core, who he is and what he's fighting for is something that everybody can identify with.
- I'd love to play Wonder Woman.
- We all wake up, and I'm sure at some point during the day we all have very similar thoughts regardless of our circumstances and where we are in the world.
- People associate girls with long blonde hair with the girls in 'Clueless' or 'Legally Blonde.' You can't be smart and educated and have an opinion because you are supposed to be stupid.
- It's weird to me to see how different everyone's opinion of beauty is.
- As far as acting goes, you get to a certain point where, I think, everyone can do the job, and it comes down to a level of commitment. I think sometimes all you have to do is show up.

- I know that you can only keep a secret a secret for so long.
- I'll work out with my trainer twice a week, and I'll do some Power Pilates and might throw in some yoga. I love to row also. The main thing for me is just to move every single day for 30 minutes to an hour.
- I read the script for 'Somnia' when I was filming 'Oculus,' and I remember calling my manager going, 'I really need to do this movie,' and he's like, 'How about you finish this one first and then you see it?' I was like, 'I don't need to. I don't need to. You need to read this. I need to do this movie. The script is very good.'
- We leave TVs on in our house. I listen to my record player constantly to just hear music. I'm really intrigued by this idea of solitude.
- 'Star Wars' was, I mean, it was the first time I remember seeing three movies that all kind of went together. It was just an amazing final understanding of what a trilogy was.
- 'Star Wars' meant everything to me growing up.
- I don't think I've ever been haunted by a ghost, but I always joke with my fiance about the house we're living in right now. It seems to have something in it.
- I'm not a big person, so every time they were adding these big guys to the cast, I said to my trainer, 'We're screwed, dude.' I'm only five foot five, and I'm going to look so little.
- I love playing characters who are multilayered and multidimensional and have a darkness to them, which makes them more realistic and more fun to play.
- A lot of shows fly under the radar for the first couple seasons and then become successful. It doesn't necessarily have any bearing on the success of the show or how much the network is behind it.
- If a character is supposed to be hated, my goal is to make her the most hated person on the show.
- Science fiction fans are awesome - they love you so much that they'll watch anything you do, even if it's complete crap. I never dreamed that I would go to conventions and sit down and have coffee with a Klingon. It's so weird, but it's my life.
- As long as people want to see me do this action and sci-fi stuff, it would be wrong of me to deny the fans what they want to see.
- You can't win some people over.
- It's things I wouldn't normally do in my real life, so when I go to work and get to beat people up and shoot guns and get waterboarded, those are things I find completely interesting.
- I've always said that I'll know when I've gone too far because I won't be able to sit down and watch it with my father.
- It's a very, very rare moment when another actor hurts you. That's not normal. If anything, it's the actor accidentally punching the stunt double, which happens quite a bit.
- I think God's wrath and purgatory are the only things keeping me on the straight and narrow. I like the idea of purgatory. It's like a cosmic do-over.
- Some of the craziest people I've met, in my life, are some of the most brilliant people I've met.
- Something about 'Battlestar' that I didn't realize when I took the job was this whole bubble aspect of closing people in and seeing what they do.
- I love that when you take that PG-13 off the table and say, 'This is what we're going to do,' everything becomes fair game, and you really go for it.
- I get recognized so much. It happens mostly when I'm in Starbucks.
- In some weird, warped way, I'm actually convinced that if I got mugged, I could probably take out the guy.
- People love a good story, even if it's a story that has very little truth to it.
- My dad always said that hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard enough.
- As people, right now, we're so over-stimulated in this world that I don't know what I'd do in Wyoming. I really don't know what I'd do. I would probably have a heart attack because I'd be so lonely, and I'd actually have to listen to myself think. That's a terrifying prospect for myself, and I'm sure many other people as well.
- Playing somebody who's still alive is very interesting.
- Basically, as soon as I saw that there was a role available on '24,' I jumped at it, and then when I sat down and talked to them, it seemed to get more interesting and more fun.
- When I was younger, it was like, 'Yay, lesbians love me!' I didn't know there was a responsibility that came with it.
- I'd never put all my chips anywhere, because I don't want to close any doors, but I was raised in a very blue-collar family. I was raised by parents who said, 'If you don't go to work every day, you're not contributing', so that's my mentality. I have to work every day; I have to bring home a paycheck.
- My mom always said, 'Marry someone smarter than yourself, Katee, because No. 1, you're not that smart. And No. 2, then you'll have smart babies.'
- I'm not very good in crowds, so I usually try to become as small as possible.
- I am a daddy's girl at heart, even though I'm in my 30s.
- I think every character I play has a physicality to them, so I have to stay in some sort of shape. I'll never be a size two. And I don't want to be a size two.
- I think that probably the time that people stopped thinking of Starbuck as 'a woman' was when they stopped thinking of the old show.
- The work environment on 'Battlestar Galactica' is unbelievable, and it's something that doesn't come along very often.
- It's interesting, the things you learn when you're 21. I learned never to get tattoos in the middle of shooting a movie. Because if you're not Angelina Jolie or Megan Fox, they will fire you.
- Sarah Corvus in 'Bionic Woman' was one of my favorite characters I've ever played, ever, for reasons that are very similar to Nikki in 'Sexy Evil Genius.' I felt that that show was taken away from me too soon, and I really wanted to dive back into that mind frame again.
- I grew up in a small town where we played around on motorcycles and things, but it really started when I got old enough. I think I was obsessed with the culture of riding. I got sick of having to date guys who rode motorcycles for me to be on them.
- It's kind of nice to play somebody that isn't psychotic or half-machine or dead or dying or on a spaceship somewhere.
- I fought for a long time on 'Battlestar' to let my hair grow out. It was very frustrating because every single person on the show was changing their hair. It was not fair.
- It's crazy: when it's raining, it makes no sense to me that people drive 10 miles an hour faster than they normally would, but then the other thing that makes no sense is when people drive 30 miles an hour slower than normal.
- No one has approached me about Captain Marvel. But I don't know if I'd even want to play Captain Marvel. I would much rather play a villain and be nasty. It's more fun.
- With a first season, you never really know how viewers or the network are going to react to a show.
- The first movie my dad ever showed me was 'Predator' - I was five. And I think the second one was 'Jaws.'
- I absolutely have not spoken to Marvel. It doesn't mean that my team hasn't spoken to Marvel.
- 'Longmire' is an incredibly hard shooting schedule because the locations are usually an hour away every morning, and I come home every weekend. I fly back to L.A. for about 26 hours a weekend, just to touch base back at home. It's a lot of work. It's four really intense months.
- What can you do? You're never going to be - I'm sure there are people out there who think Cindy Crawford isn't pretty.
- My goal is to make people feel passionately, if it's negative or positive, I did my job.
- There's always going to be someone somewhere who doesn't agree with my parents' opinion of me. It can't bother you.
- I knew from the first episode that 'Longmire' was something special - I met the writers/exec producers, read the script, and knew it was special, so to have the network and the studio and the fans get behind it in the way that they have has been really amazing.
- I read YA novels constantly, so I really want to be in a young adult rom-com, but I worry that I'm aging into the parent role, which is a little scary.
- Michael Hogan is an absolutely brilliant actor, so anytime I get to work with someone of that caliber, I get excited.
- People don't realize that I started in musical theater. That's where my roots are.
- I looked at my parents when I was 17, and I said, 'I'm moving to L.A.'
- I hate horror movies, with a passion.
- 'Somnia' is a story about loss and, I guess, what you're willing to do to have closure and try and feel whole again. It's a story of redemption in a sense. I don't want to give too much away, but it's a heartbreaking story that's incredibly terrifying.
- I'm kind of used to being around guys on set, and I grew up with a brother who treated me like I was a boy.
- My manager has been my manager since I was 17, and he says that he's supposed to be smart for me when I can't do it for myself.
- I'm a lot girlier than the roles that I play. I joke with Tricia Helfer all the time that she's my muscle.
- As an actor, you put yourself out there. You put yourself in the arena as an easy target.
- I would hate for my father to regret all his support that he's given me over the years and be embarrassed by anything I chose to do.
- I grew up in Oregon so I grew up around reservations, so I've always kind of had this knowledge. Not a tremendous amount of knowledge, but an outsider's knowledge of what reservation life was like.
- I'm always awkward when someone recognizes me.
- I love to run, and I actually run quite a bit.
- I grew up watching science fiction and action movies. I love it. I absolutely love it!
- We're not curing cancer, people. I wish we were, but we're not. It's entertainment.
- I'm a huge fan of Kate Beckinsale. Sigourney Weaver gets me excited. Angelina Jolie... There's just so many women that do 'tough' really well.
- The Olympics was a goal, and definitely, swimming in college was a goal.
- I was planning that whole athletic slide into Stanford rather than actually getting a 1450 on my SATs.
- I don't subscribe to the thinking that being typecast is a bad thing.
- There's a side to you as an actor, a selfish side, that wants to go on and play different roles.
- I have never looked at a child and been so angry that I flipped out.
- I remember auditioning for the Wonder Woman television show and being told that I wasn't the Wonder Woman type, but if I wanted to play the best friend, I could audition for that.
- Everyone freaks out because my character is the only one who has shorts on the Galactica. Well, that is because I went and grabbed a pair of pants and scissors and cut them off and gave her shorts.
- I think what we've been able to do with 'Longmire' is balance this procedural with a bit of a soap opera, and it's a character study of this character, Walt Longmire, and the people around him.
- As far as I'm concerned... there's a side to an actor that wants to go on and play a thousand different roles.
- 'Battlestar' was 22 episodes - 9 to 10 months a year - and we were exhausted. You finish shooting, and the last thing you want to do is go back to work. You want those 3 months off because you're tired - it's a grueling shooting schedule.
- I wear high heels and dresses. I am a total girly girl.
- I famously had a huge television producer say to me one time, 'Can you please stop doing that to your face? It's very distracting and unattractive.' And I was like, 'You mean move it? Okay, sorry, I guess we're not going to work together.'
- You know, I like to think that I'm a really strong, tough person, but I'm not. I'm a very, very needy person. I'm very insecure. I'm very impressionable.
- I love Harley Quinn. I do. I just love it.
- Somebody can't complain when they enjoy going to work and enjoy the people they work with.
- I think, as a woman in action in the business, you would be stupid not to express interest. Any female action role that presents itself as an opportunity I would throw myself at!
- The sad thing is, I never wanted to be Princess Leia - I always wanted to be Han Solo!
- I am tired of women playing action heroes like men, because they are not men. But sometimes they are written like men.
