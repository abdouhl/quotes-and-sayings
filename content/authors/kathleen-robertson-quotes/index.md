- The director is a Canadian, Jeff Stephenson, and any time I get a script that has any Canadian component, I'm always immediately much more interested.
- Usually I'm very, very involved with choosing my character's wardrobe and knowing exactly how I want the character to look and this is the color palette and the textures and these are the kinds of shoes she'd wear.
- You have twenty-one days to shoot a whole movie and sometimes you go into that thinking 'ugh, this could potentially be really, really difficult' and it turns out to be the most incredible experience.
- I am also really into religious artifacts.
- I think everyone can relate to the idea of making a bad choice - and knowing it's a bad choice - but doing it anyway.
- If I put the top down, I start to burn in about five minutes.
- I'm really into antiques. But really into it because of my father, who got me into them in the first place. He's an interior designer and he's really into going to antique shows and getting up really early on Sundays and driving out to these weird little towns north of Hamilton.
- First off, from reading the script and knowing that I was going to be apart of it, I'm a huge 'Wizard of Oz' fan so to be involved in something that was connected to the original books was really exciting for me and it was very different than anything I had ever worked on before.
- You never know what you're getting into like some of the best experiences I've ever had have been movies that literally had a million dollar budget and everybody's eating Cheetos all day and running around without permits and trying not to get caught.
- There are a lot of stars I've worked with - big stars - who, when they walk on set, the energy just changes.
- For whatever reason I tend to get roles that are more damaged.
- I don't want to be more famous than what I have right now. At least in that sense where people come up to me in the grocery store.
