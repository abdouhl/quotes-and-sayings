- I'm not very active politically. The causes I work on offer immediate, practical, accessible help, and politics has never meant that to me.
- What we need is more women writers, writing for older women. There are some actresses who have production companies and create their own material, and I truly admire that.
- It never occurred to me that I couldn't change things that needed changing or couldn't have what I wanted if I worked hard enough and was good enough.
- I'm very old-fashioned in some ways because of my father, who thought that being a public servant was an honor. Everyone must find a capacity in which they can serve, because we all benefit from society.
- I think Europeans have enough tradition and respect for the experience and body of work of an actress that they don't sell out to the new ones.

- I am certainly a liberal.
- I'm not a New York snob.
- You shouldn't get to live in society and give nothing back. People complain about their taxes, yet they do nothing for the community. That makes me furious.
- It begins and ends with money. It's absurd in this day and age when we need so much money for education, health, for people, that a $100 million dollars can be spent on a film. It's obscene.
- The older I get, the less I suffer fools gladly.

- There are still women who are not living their own lives, but living through their men or their children.
- I never took to Hollywood.
- I have no desire to play most of the roles being offered.
- I rent houses in LA when I'm filming. I find the isolation there terrifying. There's nowhere to go, there's nowhere to be with people. I'm not a beach bunny.
- What makes me angry? The education of children. How in God's name can you expect to have a functioning society the way we teach our kids?
- I think my mission is to become the greatest human I can. I know that sounds pompous, but what else do we have?
- I want people to like me. They don't have to always like my characters, you understand.
- The big gap between the ability of actors is confidence.
- I know there are nights when I have power, when I could put on something and walk in somewhere, and if there is a man who doesn't look at me, it's because he's gay.

- At about 40, the roles started slowing down. I started getting offers to play mothers and grandmothers.

- I do not admire young actresses whose foreheads cannot move.
- If my ego was out of whack and I believed I could carry anything off, that would be a stupid risk. But so far there's been no reason not to try anything.
- I often play women who are not essentially good or likable, and I often go through a stage where I hate them. Then I end up loving and defending them.
- This is not about abortion or the antics. This is about pro choice versus anti-choice and government intervention in a woman's personal decisions about her life.
- Being a sex symbol has to do with an attitude, not looks. Most men think it's looks, most women know otherwise.
