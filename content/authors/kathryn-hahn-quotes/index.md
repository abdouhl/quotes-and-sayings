- There is a lot of kissing in 'Boeing-Boeing.' A lot! And not pecks on the cheek or lips - although there's some of that, too - but full-on, farcical lip locks. My poor husband. He definitely wasn't prepared for as much smooching as there is.
- Honestly, I think I was in kindergarten. I remember seeing a play and realizing that was what I wanted to do. I remember always wanting to retreat to my room or somewhere private to play pretend by myself.
- I love that I'm a character actress and get to do so many different and interesting roles. There's really no reason that I can't continue on forever, because I've never been typecast as one thing.
- As an actor, you know, I love not being pigeonholed, which is great. No one really knows who I am. So that's a positive.
- There was something about the Cleveland Play House that was the holiest place - you know, with the ghost light on the stage and the brick. It was just the most beautiful theater in the world.
- It's funny: I did 'Step Brothers' the same summer I did 'Revolutionary Road,' which are completely different.
- I wish when I was 17, somebody had told me not to care so much about what other people had thought.
- It is no small thing that the juiciest and most complicated roles of my life have come post-having two children.
- And then 'Wanderlust,' Ken Marino and David Wain wrote the funniest - they're amazing. That was one of my most favorite creative experiences; we're all up at that commune, a small group of people. Everyone was funnier than the next. It was an amazing ensemble feeling. Everyone gave and took in the best way.
- As a mother, I've seen a lot of animated movies, and, I've got to say, there's so much crap out there for children.
- I've been pretending to be normal for so much of my life.
- I've always done theater. I've never thought of myself as a comedic actress in any way. 'Anchorman' kind of cracked that open. When I got a small part in 'Anchorman,' I didn't know it was possible on camera to improvise. So I was like, 'What's happening?'
- I love Viggo Mortensen so much.
- Even the shows or movies that we know are not going to change the world, I love this. I love 'em. I'm a movie fan. I'm a nerd of any kind. I love a big studio comedy as much as I love the teeniest tiniest of indie. I'm not a snob in that way. I really do like a big, big studio comedy.
- I have two young kids. So my VCR, like, you kind of have to sift through a lot of, like, 'Animal Mechanicals,' 'Mickey Mouse Clubhouse.'
- I think I was always a drama queen. I really, really, really loved playing pretend.
- Being a parent is beautiful chaos and not at all like how you imagine.
- I live a pretty normal life.
- Your creative life can continue to just turn inside out and evolve in ways that you can't possibly imagine, whether or not you decide to be a parent. It doesn't matter.
- I'm always in awe of improvisers that make something out of complete nothing.
- I'm always blown away by stand-ups. I'm blown away by people like that who are craftspeople at comedy.
- I want to do a safari.
- I was on vacation with my family when I got the scripts for 'Wanderlust' and I was trying to work on the audition while I was on vacation. I remember a big gust of wind blew the entire script into the pool, so I had to dry it with a hairdryer.
- I loved doing 'Bad Moms.' I loved doing 'We're the Millers.' But now that I've tasted complexity, it doesn't matter what the genre is - it would be really hard to go back.
- A lot of actors are like, 'Why do I do this? My character wouldn't do this? This doesn't make sense.' And in a comedy, you kind of just need to walk into the door.
- I'm not good with decisions.
- I feel like there is something about having a copacetic world POV that helps in making a comedy. Like, David Wain has such a particular way of looking at the world. It helps when everyone can see behind his eyes, you know?
- I don't want to ever say to somebody, 'You don't have to see it. It's not good.' I'm done with that. I'd love to just do things that I respect. That being said, I do have two children to put through school, so we'll see if I can put my money where my mouth is, but I would love to just work with people I respect.
- I was a theater nerd.
- It really is a biological bummer that a woman's chief moneymaking years align with her most fertile. It sucks. I wish that there was some way you could invert it.
- I'm really proud of 'Private Life.' It's about a marriage and a couple on the hunt to make a family by any means necessary. They're on such an obsessive quest that, after awhile, you forget that it's even for a baby. It fits right in that middle pocket of being a comedy and a drama.
- I've always been a fan of horror because I feel like it is one of the last genres where you need to see at a theatre, sharing in this profound experience of seeing it with a community of people.
- I think I was always the class clown.
- I think I'm accidentally funny more so than thinking of it as a craft. I'm in awe of those comedians that know how to hit it again and again and again.
- I feel grateful that the person I end up working with a lot is Paul Rudd. He's a prince among men, and so talented, and generous, and effortless.
- 'Free Agents' was an awesome experience. I never play the glam girl in anything, so that was a new experience. I would walk into one of my trailers and it would be like Spanx, a spray-tan gun, and chicken cutlets. I would have hair extensions. It was hilarious. Every day felt like I was turning into an awesome drag queen.
- I went to Catholic school for the cheapest private education.
- I have to say I don't mind getting older.
- My life is a big accident, so where I end up, I think it's all accidents.
- I went to Catholic school growing up. I can barely remember any prayers or anything!
- Working, I can be my truest self. I don't know how healthy that is.
- I'm such a grandma. I don't tweet; I don't have a Facebook page.
