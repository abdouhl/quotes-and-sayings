- I don't half love being in my forties! You feel more grown-up and can say 'no' to things without feeling you're letting the whole team down. You don't have to worry about pleasing other people all the time. You just feel more comfortable in yourself.
- I don't go there any more. I think I've done my time at the Red Lion.
- 'Walking and Talking' is my love letter to books, '70s television, music and friendship.
- I had two older brothers who kept dirty mags under their mattresses. They didn't know I knew.
