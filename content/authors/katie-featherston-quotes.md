- I've twice accidentally stolen something, and both times I went back and paid for them when I realized I had done it.
- I have friends that I have made through Twitter or things like that, but they're all verified as real people - I've either seen them perform, or we're mutual fans of each other, something like that. I don't have any authentic, 'Catfish'-worthy stories.
- I don't spend a lot of time thinking about scary demons, but I think that there are things in this world that are unexplainable that are mystical or paranormal. The possibility is there, definitely.
- What I really want to do is comedy. I would love to do some guest star spots on some single-camera comedies.
- I loved growing up and going to haunted houses and being scared. I loved watching 'The Exorcist,' 'Candyman' and all sorts of scary movies.
- I loved scary movies growing up.
- I have plenty of dream roles because there is so much I want to do, but my dream year would be to be in a single-camera comedy and then, on my hiatus, film a little low-budget indie drama. That would be a dream 12-month period. A dream role depends on having good material and working with people that I can learn from.
- I think fear of the unknown is the scariest thing.
- I'm at that great level where fans will stop and say 'hi,' which I love, but the paparazzi don't care, which is incredible.
- I've had some people tell me they're glad I'm a normal girl. Of course I'm a normal girl!
- I can not watch either of the 'Paranormal' films alone.
