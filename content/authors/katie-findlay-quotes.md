- I'm a wall to wall geek. I love sci fi; I've had a crush on Spider-Man since I was five years old, and there's an uncomfortably large shelf in my living room just for my comics.
- At age 10, I was better at ballet than I think I will ever be at any physical activity for the rest of my life.
- I love biographies. I'm especially into stuff about Hollywood in the '40s and '50s. I find it fascinating and terrifying.
- I don't know how to exist before 9 A.M. And without coffee, I'm not classified as a human. Actually, I could be regarded as a threat.
