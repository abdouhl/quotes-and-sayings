- Without Merlin, there would be no Gandalf, so I see them as the same thing, one a continuation of the other.
- I had this vague notion that one day I might be editor of 'Vogue China.' It was a bizarre ambition, as I didn't speak a word of Chinese. There were flaws in my plan, admittedly.
- I spend a lot of time on eBay buying vintage. I also really like Alexander Wang, Miu Miu, Vivienne Westwood, McQueen and Balmain.
- Maybe people don't see me as believable playing a person of today. I guess I'm just more realistic in a corset and funny hairstyles.
- One day I'd love a house in the country, with some chickens, dogs and kids.
- I grew up in a small town in Ireland and didn't know any actors. I never thought it was a viable job. It wasn't until I was on 'The Tudors' that I realised it was a possibility.
- I love being as bad as possible! You've got to love a bad girl. Look at 'Gone With the Wind,' Scarlett O'Hara - total bad girl, but you love her.
- It's not an understatement to say that I owe everything as an actor to 'Merlin.' It was pretty much my first job, and I didn't know what I was doing for many years on it. It wasn't until the third and fourth series - the fourth series especially - that I really found my feet with the character, and as an actress.
- I do keep getting these bad girl roles. The funny thing is that, honestly, I don't think I'm believable as these aristocratic mean girls. But I do love playing them.
- I get sent lots of jewellery by fans, and that's absolutely lovely.
- No actor can play a villain if they don't sympathise with him or her - otherwise the character just becomes a two-dimensional caricature.
- I'm not a high-maintenance person.
- If I could have picked an era to have lived, I think I would've loved to have been one of Louis XIV's mistresses. They were so fantastic and aristocratic, and they had so much power. And he was such a renaissance man. I think I would've fit into that nicely.
- My mum's amazing - every time I achieve something in my career, she buys me a diamond earring.
- I wasn't born an actress, but I was certainly born dramatic!
- I wear a lot of black, knitwear, skinny jeans and very high heels. My mum used to work for a fashion designer making knitwear, so she knits me lots of chunky scarves, hats and gloves, which I love.
- I don't get recognized in England. Not at all. Every so often, I get recognized in other countries.
- I loved every minute of working in wardrobe. But I love being an actress so much more. I don't think I was very good in costume, so it's better that I prefer being an actress.
- Working crew made me realise that the actors are a very small part of a very big machine, with each part being vital to make the show work. It so important to remember that it's not about you, it's about the show, and working crew hammered that point home to me.
- I am really terrible when it comes to guys. Inside, I just see myself as this overweight tomboy with funny-coloured hair and bad skin.
- I'm a very ambitious girl. I'll go wherever there is a good part.
- I can't watch most of my work. Once I come on screen, all I can think of is 'What am I doing with my hands?' or 'Why did I lean that way?' or 'What's that look on my face?' It's too difficult to not focus on evaluating my acting.
- My friend once sculpted me a bust of Admiral Ackbar from 'Star Wars.' He's my favourite character in the films after Han Solo. He's that goldfish-type alien in the white costume. 'It's a trap!' I'm a big geek.
