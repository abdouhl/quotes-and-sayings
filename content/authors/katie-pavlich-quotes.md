It's pathetic, cowardly, unconstitutional and completely predictable.

- The NRA isn't a boogeyman, it's a grass-roots organization made up of 5 million law-abiding Second Amendment supporters.

- President Obama has argued there isn't a threat of terrorism from the U.S. refugee program because for individuals who apply it takes two years, 'heavy vetting' and is a relatively long process.

- James O'Keefe is a journalist, doing the work 'real' journalists don't dare, and has been conducting undercover investigations for years with dozens of scalps collected along the way. The more the 'true' journalists who back the Democrat machine attack him, the more emboldened he becomes to pursue his next project.

Even if Planned Parenthood didn't do abortions, none of these 'wonderful things' are worthy of taxpayer funding. But thanks to Trump, the lie of Planned Parenthood's heroism has been further proliferated.
- The pro-life movement is and has been led by women for decades. The history of the movement shows this, despite the current narrative about men 'controlling' or making laws about women's bodies.
- The Tea Party movement started in late 2008 as a rejection of President George W. Bush's bailout of the auto industry and Obama's excessive stimulus spending.
