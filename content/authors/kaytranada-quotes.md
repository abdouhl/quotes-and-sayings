- I was really not into school. Everything was distracting to me. I would have a beat in my head or a song. I was always not paying attention, just daydreaming.
- Nando's - boom! That's what I'm thinking of whenever I'm in London. I go there every time.
- I don't think about doing new. I just do it.
- People should be going to shows to have fun and express themselves - just enjoy it!
- I always say I want creative control. A lot of people don't think about that. And that's what every artist should think of - being creative and not just a puppet.
- I didn't finish high school. I tried to as an adult, but with all this touring, I had to quit.
- I've always wanted to produce a whole album for an artist.
- I like that people are still trying to guess what kind of music I'm making.
- Neo-soul caught my attention more than any other sub-genre. I was really attracted by that sound. It made me do what I do musically: trying to find the same type of vibes, those nostalgic vibes.
- The DJ thing is just a way for me to perform my songs in public. It put me on the map, and a lot of people discovered me because of my DJing and later found out that I made beats.
- I don't want awkward shows with people looking at their phones or tweeting. That's something you should do at home.
- I'm always home, doing nothing, making beats, and watching movies.
- Really, what I'm trying to do is make soul music, but I don't even think of it as a genre. It's more of a feeling.
- The way I picked the tracks for '99.9%' was based on the feeling of, 'Is this going to be a hit?' I wanted songs that people would immediately hear and remember.
- I love the London vibe. I get so much love from London that I never had from other places. It's crazy. The people there understand music so much more.
- The producing side is always a hard thing for me. I look at Flying Lotus and see producers dropping instrumentals, and I think I should do it myself. I just try to be an artist for myself. That way, it's a lot easier.
- I'm looking for all types of sounds. Anything that has soul and funk in it, no matter the genre.
- It's pretty much about doing what you love and following your dreams. It sounds really corny, but it's so real.
- I come from hip hop for sure, and there are basic elements of that, but then I'll take from somewhere else, like samba, and do it with trap drums. I like going places other people haven't gone before.
- You gotta be versatile, man.
- I suck at video games.
- I used to listen to my music on the bus. It was one of my favourite things, to look out the window and over at the Jacques Cartier Bridge and Parc Jean-Drapeau.
- I'm not just a remix guy.
- When I make a good beat, I'm possessed. I'm not on earth!
- I don't have much of a wish list, but I'm dying to work with Erykah Badu. That's pretty much my dream collaboration.
- I don't feel like a live set even seems super real for an electronic act like me. It's not really that entertaining. I've seen a lot of my favourite acts take it to a new level with a live band and stuff, which is amazing, but for me, a live set would be boring to watch.
- I'm from the suburbs, really, so I actually didn't go to Montreal until I was, like, 19. I wasn't allowed to go to the city at night or really be in the scene with other producers. It was hard for my parents to understand what I was trying to do as an artist, but it didn't stop me. They eventually saw that it wasn't a joke.
- I'm my own stylist. Always! I don't wanna hire someone to chose what I should wear. At the same time, I do always wanna wear some crazy clothes.
- Some people say I make hip-hop. Others see me as doing EDM. Some people might look at me as a trap artist, but I'm not really stuck to any of those.
- When I'm playing, I play what I want, but I make sure that the crowd is going to love it at the same time. It's like a balancing act, a mix of two, a perfect circle... if you do it right.
- I've always wanted to push someone who's not really known but has mad talent. I don't know if I'm going to do a publishing company or a record label, but I'm interested in pushing artists in any sense.
- It's easier to collaborate with instrumentalists than singers; they know exactly the sound that I need.
- Especially for Haitian immigrant parents, being a musician is not a job.
- I felt like there were two people inside me. I was trying to be somebody I was not, and I was frustrated that people didn't know who I was.
- Deep down, you know what you want, and you should go for it.
- '99.9%' is the end product of years and years of me going through multiple styles and interests.
- I know a lot of people who jumped into a record label right away, dropped an album, and then nothing happened for them. Build your fan base first, and follow your gut.
- I can't judge Justin Bieber, because I don't know him.
