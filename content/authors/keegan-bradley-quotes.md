- Especially in wind, each shot and stance can feel different, so it's important to first get comfortable.
- To flight approach shots lower with the scoring clubs - what I consider my 7-iron through wedges - I stand two or three inches closer to the ball than normal.
- The best part about winning the PGA is getting great pairings at tour events. It's fun to play with Phil Mickelson and other past major champions.
- Growing up in Vermont, no matter what I did, I didn't get much recognition.
- I realize Tiger Woods is Tiger Woods; he's intimidating.
- I like using a 75-percent swing for wedge shots instead of full force.
- You can't swing with hesitation; you can't try to steer the ball to the flag; you can't worry about that water hazard as you take the club back. You have to pick the right club, visualize the shot you want to hit, and then focus on that shot until the ball is gone.
- When I throw a softball, there's no time to think about the motion of my arm. I just look at the first baseman's glove and react.
- I've always played my best golf in the summer.
- When it's deep into the season and you're not playing well, it's frustrating. This is when it's time to revisit some basics.
- It's such an advantage to be able to hit short irons low on command. When it's windy, you'll hit more greens. But low shots are a great strategy in calm conditions, too: The less time the ball hangs in the air, the less time it has to stray off line from the flagstick.
- The beauty is, while you're working on chipping, you're also working on driving. This is because the bottoms of both swings - the area around impact - are identical.
- It's very difficult to consistently hit good iron shots if you get off to a bad start. That's why I'm always paying attention to my setup and takeaway.
- I was the first to win a major with a belly putter, and I've spent hours practicing that way, so I hope they don't ban anchoring.
- Most amateurs are so worried about mis-hitting the shot or hitting it off line, they don't make an aggressive move. You'd be surprised how much better your swing will get if you let your natural athletic ability shine. So go after it.
- Seems like my iron play gets a little better every year. Which makes sense - I've been working hard on things with my teacher, Jim McLean.
- People look at me weird because I'm a Howard Stern fan, but he's very misunderstood. It's the first thing I do when I get in my car at a tournament - just pray that I get Howard 100 on Sirius or XM.
- I love team environments, like the Celtics, the Bruins. I love going into the locker room and meeting these guys.
