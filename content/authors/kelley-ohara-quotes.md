- Got to go to the ESPYs, which was so cool.
- When I was in middle school and even high school, I wasn't comfortable with my body. I look back, and it makes me sad, but I've grown into my body and really embrace it. I don't have the typical girl body; I'm kind of built like a boy.
- I love how I look. My favorite body part is my butt because that's where we get all our power from, and that's what keeps me going up and down the field and drives my explosiveness. I kind of have a bubble butt, but it helps me do what I need to do!
- The summer before my senior year of college, I would surf every single morning, and I got better and loved it. For me, it is nice to get away from the soccer field and have these other things to clear your mind. You don't have to be good at it; you just do it and enjoy it. It is nice to have that balance, and I need that balance in my life.
- As a sub, you just want to help your team in whatever way you can.
- This is the whole reason you play: to win your country a World Cup!
- I started playing soccer when I was 4 because my sister was doing it. It was my first organized sport, and my parents thought this was a great way to get coordinated and be part of a team. I had an array of options but eventually figured out soccer was best for me.
- I first started drinking chocolate milk to refuel in college when one of my assistant coaches said there were studies that proved that lowfat chocolate milk was great for recovery, so after practice, we would get out two big gallons and drink it together as a team.
- I would say I eat pretty clean for the most part. Everything in moderation. I don't deny myself.
- I could wear a dress one day and boyfriend jeans the next. I usually just want to make sure I'm comfortable.
- It's every little girl's dream to go onto the World Cup.
- For me it's just about that self-confidence and finding what you love and just chasing after it with reckless abandon and never letting anyone tell you that you can't do something.
- I remember watching the '96 Olympics. For some reason, I was like 'Oh yeah, I'm going to go to the Olympics some day.' At that time as a kid, I did not know for what sport or really anything.
- I think I was just a very competitive child.
- If you have a goal and you set your mind to it, you can absolutely achieve it.
- It's fun scoring goals, but I also like to stop them.
- What you do on the field can only be a positive if you take care of what you need to off the field, and that means recovery and refueling.
- Soccer is a cruel sport sometimes.
- I drink coffee every day, either espresso or cortado, which is two shots espresso and steamed milk.
- Inspiring people to look at their goals and go for that and believe in themselves is amazing.
- Life is awesome as a college athlete, and then it's a total cliff to jump off.
- Surfing was something I always wanted to do.
- When I go into games as a forward, my job is really clear, and I just have to execute. But as a midfielder, you get to sort of enjoy the game more, and you get to feel the game and dictate the play.
- I used to apply waterproof mascara before a game - it was the easiest thing to wear while I was playing that wouldn't sweat off - but not anymore.
- I have a ton of broken baby hairs in front. It just comes with the territory of being a soccer player.
- I'm from Georgia and grew up eating Chick-fil-A. I'm obsessed with all forms of fried chicken, like chicken briskets and chicken sandwiches.
- For me, it's really important to take care of my skin. Especially because when I see someone, and they're just so fresh and beautiful, you always notice their skin first. So having a really good skin-care regimen is a must. I just wish I would have started taking care of my skin earlier!
- I don't like feeling full when I start a game, so that's why I have a bigger meal in morning or four hours before game.
- Your No. 1 priority as a defender is to keep the ball out of the back of the net.
- If you have people invested emotionally in the success of their team, that usually translates to strong attendance.
- No excuses. Play like a champion.
- I don't tend to wear a lot of makeup in general.
- I love to get out there and sweat and mix things up, whether I'm on the field or in the gym.
- I'm lenient when it comes to nutrition rules. I enjoy cooking and baking in general, and I just try to eat whole, clean foods. I try to stay away from processed or boxed stuff - but that's not to say I don't eat that from time to time. I really like making Asian noodle salad and also make soup a lot, like tortilla soup.
- I actually don't wear any makeup when I'm on the field. I like looking nice, but my main concern is how I play - to me, if you look and feel good, then you play good. On the field, I only wear Coppertone Sport SPF 30. I like it because it feels like I'm putting on lotion rather than SPF.
- I still have that forward's mentality that when I have the chances, it just ticks me off if I can't put it in.

- I'm down for anything.
- I think soccer in America is growing exponentially, and it's just going to keep getting bigger.
- It's fun to be able to dress up from time to time and pretend that I don't wear cleats, a T-shirt, and shorts every day.
- Soccer fans spend almost as much time outdoors as we do! Whether you're heading out onto the field for practice or cheering from the sidelines, throw a broad spectrum sunscreen into your bag to help protect your skin from the sun.
- Be the best teammate you can be, be the best player you can be, and just be as supportive and encouraging for the people who are playing.
- They were some of the best years of my life, and I'm so thankful I was able to go to Stanford.
- Nothing can replace sleep, but coffee can do it best. I love coffee.
