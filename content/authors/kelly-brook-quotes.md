- I was always performing as a child, and then I was determined to act and sing and dance, so I travelled for miles every day to go from home in Kent into London.
- Sex keeps me fit and healthy. What can be better than that? It's not about crazy diets or gym workouts.
- I can't promise to love someone for ever. I can't imagine anyone could promise to love me for ever. I mean, it sounds like a lovely day, but I go to red carpet events all the time and I'm the centre of attention so it's not like I'm looking for that!
- I eat everything. I love it! I couldn't deny myself food. What a waste of a life.
- It's good to mix high street and designer and vintage. I'm a big fan of vintage stuff.
- I'm not thin. I don't starve myself.
- I'm very much known as being the smiley girl, and unfortunately, lightness can be mistaken for stupidity or someone with no depth.
- I am a light person. I think of myself with a shield, a protective shield around me. And I think of bad things bouncing off it. Boom, boom, boom, ba-boom, ba- boom!
- In this country we're just obsessed with making people celebrities before they've even done anything, which I think is just shocking.
- I'm always professional and turn up on time and do my job.
- I feel a lot more comfortable on stage in the theatre. It just reminds me of being a kid and doing pantomimes.
- I don't think I'm misunderstood, but there is definitely a certain side of me that the press focuses on - my body, my hair, or who I'm dating - which has never really served me as an actor. It's served me in the commercial world, making money as a model, but the media perception has really hindered my acting career.
- I regard myself as an actress but, obviously, not in the Dame Judi Dench league. That isn't a problem because I don't think we are ever likely to be up for the same part!
- People think if you are a celebrity and if you're beautiful, or if you're slim, then life is a bed of roses. Or they think that if you're wealthy, you don't have normal relationship problems, because why would anyone reject you?
- My most annoying habit is laughing all the time. I can't stop giggling. I do it because I'm nervous.
- I don't want to make the same mistakes of being swept along with things, taking on jobs that I'm not passionate about, that I don't really believe in but that everyone says I should do.
- I've loved acting and dancing since I was a kid. Before anyone thought I was pretty or before I had a voluptuous figure, that was what I was going to do.
- I'm into wellbeing, not because of social pressures to look a certain way, but because I'm interested in living a long, full and healthy life.
- Women in the 1950s were so much sexier. That's what I aspire to look like.
- It makes my skin crawl to think about the violent ways snakes, lizards, alligators and other exotic creatures are raised and killed for boots, bags and belts.
- I've always paid my own way, I've never lived off anyone.
- I love my family, but I don't think they think about my career a lot or nuffin.
- My mum was never strict. I was allowed to go out to clubs underage, watch TV, listen to whatever music I wanted to, and that made me not rebel. I have never touched a drug in my life.
- I'm really pleased that women like me as well as men. My fanbase is quite evenly split.
- I'm quite loud. When I was in film and TV, people were always saying, 'Oh Kelly, make it smaller, make it smaller.'
- The thing is I really struggle with commitments, so committing myself to six months to a year in a soap opera... I don't think it would suit my lifestyle. A few days working on a project is enough for me, and then I get bored and am ready to move on and do something else.
- I've always wanted to be independent and answer for myself. That probably is the part of me I would class to be feminist. I'd like to have children; marriage I have a bit of an issue with.
- I love flying around the world doing what I do - that keeps me so busy.
- I do Google myself. Not that often, though, and the stories are always rubbish.
- I remember when I got to 16, my mum was like, 'No, now you've got to go and get a proper job. We've indulged you long enough.' I don't think they ever thought I was going to be successful in entertainment at all.
- I think the more mediocre you are the better you do because people need to think you're their friend, they don't want to be threatened by you, you've got to be warm, you've got to be not too smart, not too pretty, not too anything.
- I'd definitely have a dog over a child.
- I go for regular facials. But I think the secret of great skin is to keep it as clean as possible, so I go without make-up on my days off.
- What I am is how I came out. No one's perfect and you just have to accept your flaws and learn to love yourself.
- I've never said I'm perfect, and I've never said I'm a skinny girl.
- I can be high maintenance for my work when I have to look good, but in my day-to-day life, hanging out at home, I'm happy with no make-up on and my hair in a ponytail.
- I think TV is all about not turning off the public, it's about not being too sexy, not being too much of anything really.
- I love glamour and being sexy and dressing up, and I think it's good to be confident.
- I think I'm quite good at being sexy in a unthreatening way.
- It's important to look your best because it reflects how you feel about yourself. I really believe that what goes on the outside reflects what's on the inside.
- I'm really good at growing roses.
- There's always going to be someone who doesn't like you, but what can they do?
- Sometimes, if I see a picture and I can make it a bit better, then I will, like everyone else does. I've been Photoshopped in every picture since I started modelling.
- People think you can't be clever if you have breasts.
