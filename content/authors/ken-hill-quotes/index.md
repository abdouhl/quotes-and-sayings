- Music is an art form too. Sometimes other forms of art can be inspiring to the musician.
- Sometime I write a song off a central idea, instead of emotion.
- Sometimes I will click on a random sequence of notes- not to actually use it in a song, but to see if I can find maybe a simple pattern that I can build off of.
- Mistakes can be good things, because it is an unexpected thing.
- The human voice sounds thicker with a chorus and reverb than a dry signal.
- Sometimes just getting out of the house and doing something you haven't done in a long time (or never done!) can open up the doors to musical inspiration.
- Composers, like authors, have a lot in common. Our main goal is to connect with the listener emotionally.
- Music is about textures as well as melody.
- The prime goal of an author is the same as a musician, which is to emotionally connect with the reader in some way or another.
- Music is an art form. It is a way to wordlessly communicate.
- If our main goal is to connect emotionally, we should want to have as many tools as we possibly can to achieve that goal. The more abilities that we have, the more choices we can make musically.
- I have come up with very creative ideas that really didn't work with the song I was currently composing.
- The more I do in my life, the more I can write music about new experiences.
- If you are making music for other people, you will have to be aware of how people relate to it.
- Hooks need to be predictable and not predictable at the same time.
- The most important thing is that you like the music.
- Location is a very important aspect to songwriting.
- People don't have fun making music all the time.
- Minds are like flowers. If you let it sit there without soaking anything up, it will dry up.
- Childhood is a promise that is never kept.
- Writing a song is much like being an author. Yes, we all have tools to write (everyone has a brain I hope!), but that doesn't all of a sudden make us best selling authors.
- Food is your body's fuel. Without fuel, your body wants to shut down.
