- As one union, SAG-AFTRA will support a future of great entertainment for all of us.
- I was involved with sports and student government, the regular stuff. I liked movies and all, but I did love the singing and putting on musicals, and I was always comfortable with that. I liked it.
- After 'The White Shadow' was over, I did some more work, but then I wound up taking a year off to teach at Harvard. It afforded me the chance to have a variegated career - a very interesting one.
- I was from a town called Manhasset, very nice town out on the North Shore of Long Island, New York, but there was a little area, predominantly black population, and it was a small school. I played on the basketball team when I was a junior, and I was the only white guy on the starting five, the top seven actually, and we were really good.
- I've always been entranced when it came to musical comedy; it's probably my favorite thing. It's a real true American form, and it's big, like Shakespeare big, when it's right. It's loud, and it's big: you have to be ready vocally and physically. It can bring people to their feet and can be as thrilling as a circus.
- I have no theories about the divorce rate or things like that, but it does occur to me that dealing with kids and their problems can be real binding glue. It keeps you out of the range of too much ego.
- Service that benefits the community and those in need is an act that betters us all.
- How we take care of our animals is a very good indicator of how we are doing as a society. It is symbolic of how, as human beings, we go about treating each other.
- I've always been attracted to independent, outspoken women.
- I grew up playing for Manhasset High on Long Island on a team with six black guys.
- Bobby Cremins really knows basketball, and he is a good man, too.
- Singing was always the thing - I played some leads in musicals. Then when I went to college, I joined a singing group.
- The reason I got into this union was to bring people together.
- Good coaches, as we all know, can have amazing influences on boys.
- One of the things that make actors good is their capacity to listen.
- The biggest concern for most actors has and always will be getting enough work - it's just part of our profession - but a real change is the idea that performers have to be more versatile and entrepreneurial in their careers.
- Sports is a terrific metaphor that's hardly been touched on TV.
- What we are, the experiences we've had, come to the surface.
- I loved that outrageous, creative style of city ball. 'Logic is the death of art,' they taught me at Yale. Maybe in basketball, too.
- In a media landscape that has grown in unimaginable ways, there are more projects that have come along now than ever. While the number of projects has grown, many players are vying for that audience.
- It is my mission to make sure SAG-AFTRA protects our members' ability to do the work they love and to build their lives around it.
- Unifying the legacy SAG and AFTRA contracts was essential, and I am very pleased that we were able to achieve that.
- Pension and health benefits are a cornerstone of union protection. When actors' work is split between two unions, that protection is weakened or, in the worst cases, eliminated. That's not acceptable, and it's one of many reasons merging SAG and AFTRA makes sense.
- I never mind going in for an audition for something.
- I was raised on Long Island. There were a lot of cops and firefighters who lived there.
- A lack of diversity permeates our industry, and SAG-AFTRA as an organization is committed to effecting change.
- IMDb publishes the actual dates of birth of thousands of actors without their consent, most of them not celebrities but rank-and-file actors whose names are unknown to the general public.
- There's a certain kind of guy, a certain kind of humor, that goes with Irish cops and firemen.
- I'm really happy to have been part of spreading the game of basketball and growing the game in a place like Turkey.
- Mike Hodge is someone I've counted on for strong, steady leadership from the very start of my union service, and he has never failed to deliver.
- Membership First's record is one of conflict, division and, ultimately, failure.
- Some people really think I'm an ex-pro player.
- The obvious challenge to both SAG and AFTRA is remaining current in a rapidly changing industry. We have to be nimble, pro-active, and unified, and we've got to bring compelling value to future members.
- I love the idea of getting into the mind of the criminal.
- When television gets in trouble is when it forgets that it all begins with the written word.
- Sometimes you wonder if television is really affecting the culture.
