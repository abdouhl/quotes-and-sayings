- It was my wife that insisted I do 'The Hangover.'

- You can't get through medical school if you don't have a strong will and a strong constitution.

- We're all conditioned to work hard, and it's not just an Asian thing: it's an Asian American thing. You maximize the little opportunity you have, and I've made a career.
- Medicine really matured me as a person because, as a physician, you're obviously dealing with life and death issues, issues much more serious than what we're talking about in entertainment. You can't get more serious than life and death. And if you can handle that, you can handle anything.
- The best thing I can recommend is to listen to your child. I really mean that.
- I think everyone's different but in comedy, I try to do my scene to make the director and the other actors laugh. If I can make them laugh and we have the same sensibility, then I'm on the right page.

- I think, at the end of the day, you should just be judged by your work, not on what effect it might have on the world or your community.
- There's really no substitute for working hard. I think that's my biggest talent. There are always people who are funnier and more talented than I am, but I don't take anything for granted and I commit myself 100% to each of my roles.
- When you're working with your friends, it doesn't feel like it's work.

- I'm very blessed that I have such a supportive wife who is secure with letting me embarrass myself.

- I never let on I was a comedian. I never acted out. It was really important to me, like, to not be Patch Adams. I was so super serious as a doctor, I would bark orders to my nurses. I was hard-core. I wanted to make sure I did my job right. I was perfectly trained to be a physician. You know, it wasn't a fluke. I worked hard at it.
- I have a very simple approach in career: You work with the people you love.
- I'll never leave 'Community,' no matter what. You're either a lifer, or you're not.
