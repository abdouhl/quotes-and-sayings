- I'm pretty much living my dream job, but one day I would love to dedicate more time to writing and performing my own music.
- I'm a huge candy fan. My favorite growing up was always Sour Belts or Sour Straws.
- I don't eat fast food - and neither should you!
- I'm into Incubus. Growing up, I was a huge Taking Back Sunday fan. I'm still a fan, but I don't listen as much as I used to. When I was 13 or 14, I started getting into emo-pop-rock, so that influenced me. I also love Drake... I have a pretty diverse collection.
- Look your significant other in the eyes, make that connection.
- I have a great relationship with everyone in my family, but I'm closer to my brothers than anyone else because they give me a lot of guidance.
