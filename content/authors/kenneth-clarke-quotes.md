- For those who want out, Brexit remains an end in itself, regardless of what is in the interest of our society, in terms of prosperity, security and influence on the wider world stage.
- I cannot remember a time in opposition - I am talking about the last four years - when we have done less work on policy and more on slogans. But because of my European views I wasn't allowed to participate.
- Without legal aid, and the dedicated lawyers who deliver it, our system of justice would quite simply collapse.
- No country anywhere in the world allows material that genuinely puts national security at risk into the public domain, and that includes a courtroom.
- I am a stalwart supporter of the British judiciary who are the best in the world.
- I am sorry to upset my colleagues by saying we wasted four years in opposition, but if you do get so badly defeated as a party you do have to face up to some painful facts and you do have to change.
- Britain's political voice depends on our role as a leading and influential member of the E.U. If we leave, we are of less value to our allies and of less concern to our enemies. We need the strongest voice we can get in the dangerous modern world.
- I am getting frustrated by the fact that we have been out of office for eight years. I desperately want to lead the Conservative Party to make quicker progress back into power.
- Politicians should inspire you to vote, they should appeal to people.
- When E.U. governments are able to agree on political and economic policies, they will remain a superpower to influence the Americans, the Russians, Indians and Chinese over the coming decades. Britain on its own would resume the decline which continued through most of the 20th century.
- Energetic action on debt would make a radical difference to the prospects of many of the poorest countries in the world, at no practical cost to creditor countries.
- Nigel Farage has persuaded too many people that we have lost control of our borders.
- The political health of Britain has deteriorated very sharply. The Conservative Party must do something about it. I am the man to do it.
- If the prime minister really believes it, he must be the only person left who thinks that the recent bombs in London had no connection at all with his policy in Iraq.
- All political careers are a rollercoaster.
- Thatcher was the best politician I have ever witnessed.
- I'm notorious for only using my mobile phone for outgoing calls: nobody knows my London number and I certainly don't do anything online.
- It would be immoral to walk away from the consequences of our actions, leaving behind anarchy and civil war in Iraq.
- Whether we remain in the European Union will determine Britain's future role in the world and the comparative success of our economy for our children and grandchildren.
- I don't think at my age... you can start ruling people out in politics.
- The Blair government has lowered the standing of politics and politicians in our country.
- Unless and until I can see an opportunity of actually reversing Brexit and restoring a stable membership of the European Union, then in the real world I concentrate on minimising the damage.
- Referendums are designed to get round parliamentary government, and people only demand referendums when they think they can't get a majority in parliament. Mussolini was the most brilliant practitioner of referendums.
- My sense is that the majority of Conservatives share my reservations about how we got into Iraq.
- Having everybody voting to avoid a Â£25 fine is no way to solve public apathy.
- I am not a creature of giant business and I think that small- and medium-sized businesses will derive the most benefit from the removal of bureaucratic obstacles to trade.
- Margaret was the best prime minister of my lifetime. Mythology has turned Thatcher into someone regarded either as a goddess by her supporters or an evil witch by her opponents.

- My entire political career has been based on building up Britain's political standing and economic prosperity through our membership of the E.U. and the European project.

- Margaret Thatcher and John Major knew that bluff and bravado doesn't work in Brussels.
- However, we do not lack anti-terrorist laws. I do not believe that the recent London bombs were the result of any deficiencies in our legal system.
- Locking people up without reducing the risk of them committing new crimes against new victims the minute they get out does not make for intelligent sentencing.
- Of course I'd have loved to be Prime Minister. But I'm not nursing a grievance.
- Jonathan Hill is an old friend of mine; I have worked with him for many years and know him to be a man of outstanding ability who has never sought a public profile.
- Only an ideologue deals with the world as he would wish it to be, as opposed to the world as it is.
