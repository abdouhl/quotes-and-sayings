- When you go a week without seeing a human face, that does something to you.

- As the Ebola virus continued to consume my patients, I witnessed the horror this disease visits upon its victims, the intense pain and humiliation of those who suffer with it.

- What I can tell you is that I serve a faithful God who answers prayers.
