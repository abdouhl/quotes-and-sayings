- I think I'm pretty coachable. I do what coaches ask of me.
- If you're a kid, it's all you think about if you stutter. Kids can be so mean. My grades suffered. Class participation weighs heavy in grading, and I wouldn't open my mouth to read or talk in front of anyone.
- I didn't have a father when I was growing up, and I vowed to be there with my kids.
- Basketball is what got me out of the projects. It got my momma the house she never had, the car she never had. Nobody is going to get the best of me. You might score more points than me, but you're going to know you were in a dogfight.
- I know the game well. I'm a student of basketball; I know what it takes to win.
- I don't back down. Like, I don't know how to flop. That's never been a part of my game. For me to know if a guy likes to turn left shoulder or right shoulder in the post, I have an advantage. Or if he likes to go left all the time, I have an advantage. Or if he can't make open jump shots, I have an advantage.
- Of course there's some things that I would have liked to have... none of my friends growing up had their father in the house. None of 'em. We had uncles and stuff like that, but nobody had a father in the house, none of my friends.
- I have feelings, but not when it comes to basketball. I'm here to win. I'm not here to make friends.
- People don't know. People are ignorant. They feel that if you stutter, then you're slow or whatnot.
