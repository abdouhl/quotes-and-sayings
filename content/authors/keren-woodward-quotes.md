- We were so young when we started, quite naive and shy - we kind of knew what we were doing but didn't because we hadn't been stage schooled.
- We were expected to smile and be flirty to everyone. But we acted more like a male rock band. We never mastered the niceties. We were more interested in having a good time.
- The group has always been based on friendship and a certain attitude.
- We were all friends who formed a band. We weren't auditioned or put together by a record label, management company or TV show.
- When Siobhan left, we never fell out or had a huge argument. She just wanted to move to America and do something different.
- I just felt very young and unprepared. I didn't know anyone who'd been pregnant, and I didn't know anyone who'd had a baby. Because everyone around me didn't really get it, I just kept on as though nothing was happening, even though I was slightly scared and throwing up everywhere.
- Being paid to travel the world with your best mates, you really can't complain.
- We were completely DIY and very opinionated. We weren't the type that sat back or do what we're told... We never listened to many people.
- We never realized how much of an influence we had.
- We've always been do-it-yourself. In that we've had complete control.
- I've got greasy hair, what can I say?
- The band is our whole lives and we are completely dedicated, but if you get too serious you'll have a lot of problems and if you don't enjoy what you are doing you shouldn't be doing it.
- I think it was about 1990 when we first wore heels to perform.
- Back in the day we didn't really have time to be a live act because we were always on TV or doing live interviews. We were being flown all over the world.
- We got a gay following around the time we started using camp dancers who were stripped to the waist in cycling shorts and aviators.
- We were always around music and we were lucky to be in the right place at the right time, knowing the right friends.
- When you're in a band it's a 24/7 thing. If you don't get on or like each other things will fall apart very quickly, which is what it seems happened with Fifth Harmony.
- We never came into the business with a plan beyond the next three months. It's all been a natural thing for us to go off and travel and then maybe record an album.
- Thank god magazines like 'Heat' weren't around in our day. The thought of someone catching you unawares on a beach and publishing photos of your cellulite... it's so hurtful, causes so many problems.
- We spent a couple of years trying to be what we thought people wanted us to be, what the press thought we should be, doing what the company wanted. Finally we just said 'Sod it. This is what we do best. We're best at making pop records that people enjoy and having fun and entertaining them.'
- We never thought of ourselves as a girl band. We dressed like blokes.
- We had no money, and we had to go through 'punk' school. We ended up living in the rehearsal room that used to be the Sex Pistols rehearsal room at Malcolm McLaren's office. So we had this sort of interesting beginning.
- After a few years, we realized that you did have to put some work into it. That's why the bimbo comments make me angry. After seven years, people have to realize we have a certain amount of talent.
- Pop music is a constant reminder of what you were doing at the time, it holds all sorts of memories.
- Everyone we knew was forming a band. Boy George, Wham! Sade. But it wasn't a big deal, they were our friends. It wasn't like we were hanging out with pop stars.
- That's what friendships are, isn't it? You don't all have to be the same, as long as you've all got the same sense of humor and same attitudes on life.
- The '80s don't seem to have gone away. Most weekends in the summer we're off doing a festival in front of 10,000 or 15,000 people with a load of other '80s acts. It was just such a great era for music, for individuals and characters. It just had a spirit.
- How we looked on TV was exactly how we looked during the day.
- We were very creative. There was nothing contrived about us. No one telling us what to do, what to wear, what to sing. We wrote our own material, chose our producers.
- Most of the people we worked with were men. And the women were secretaries.
- The perfect pop song is about creating a memory.
- I'd hate to be too grown-up. That would be dull.
- When we go out, we do enjoy ourselves. We don't worry about whether or not people will recognize us.
- We're best at doing pop music - we're not good at doing down, depressing music.
- I'm actually quite proud of the fact that we made a success of ourselves in a donkey jacket and DMs, without any thought to sexualising what we were doing.
- We had to pose with towels wrapped around us, holding rubber rings, that sort of thing. The turning point came when a photographer asked us to get on a fur rug and crawl like cats. We said no, because it was sexist and disrespectful.
- I was very aware as a young mum that I had to be there and not go off the rails. I would go clubbing, then come home and make breakfast for the baby.
- I can't even compare ourselves with the Supremes. I adore the Supremes! I can't set myself up as comparison to people I'm in awe of.
- I'm not worried about wrinkles on my cheeks, or going grey. I'm not trying to be 20.
- I think we've got the tracks that everyone wants to sing along to. A lot of people say, 'God, I've forgotten you've had so many hits!'
- A lot of my family were teachers, so that's what I always thought I'd end up being.
- My dad was fine, but I have to say my mum was upset when I said I was leaving home.
- We were approached to do the story of Bananarama as a film.
- We've never been good at long-term plans.
- We wouldn't ever sit down and pretend that our friendship didn't fall apart back in the late '80s. It wasn't like there was a massive bust-up. We just drifted apart.
- Radio in the U.K. is so formulaic. You've got commercial stations who play the same 20 songs all day.
- We didn't want to be famous. We just loved the music and excitement.
- Women shouldn't have to apologise for their age or growing old. It is just inevitable.
- If I look back on my life, you can almost tell the story of it through pop songs. Romances as a teenager, your first kiss, first love, first heartbreak.
- If people want to compare us to the Shangri-Las, then that's all well and good. But those groups were put together. They were told what to sing, dressed up, neatly packaged. We're like the '80s version in that we're more outgoing, more involved in it.
- If we'd had a Svengali manager and done what we would have been told, maybe we would have had a bigger, more hugely successful career.
- We used to do 'Venus' live for a long time but never got 'round to recording it because people would always say it's too old-fashioned a song.
- But you're not really emotionally mature in your 20s. Well, we weren't. You don't say anything, you just bottle it up and then it builds up.
- It's a real shame if people feel they have to do anything that makes them uncomfortable to be successful.
- When you've known someone for so long you never lose that friendship.
- It's not like we don't have any talent. We can't sing like Whitney Houston, but we can sing well.
- We want people to enjoy our music.
- People thought we were intimidating, especially once we'd had a few drinks, but when I look back we were virtually on top of each other, holding hands. We sounded so stupid.
- I definitely think we paved the way for other girl groups. We did it very much on our own terms without kowtowing to all the men in the business or being told what to do by anyone. For that we feel very proud.
- I find it really irritating when a band changes the melody of a song you know.
- I've never been on a diet that lasted more than a day.
- I don't know how to write or to be anything other than Bananarama-ish because that's who we are.
- We lived at the Sex Pistols' house because we were asked to vacate our room at the YWCA for 'keeping late hours.'
- We've sung to prerecorded tracks and things like that, but we've never done a proper world tour with a band and everything.
- There is nothing worse than a spoilt brat.
- The record label used to try and make us do stuff, like dance, and we'd say, nah, not doing that.
- The first time I got recognized in the Sates, it was by Mike Tyson. He sang 'Cruel Summer' at us as we were walking out of the hotel to go to the beach.
- We did 10 years of working and travelling constantly, and we were just knackered. I thought: 'I've got to take a break.' I felt like I was going mad. I decided to move to Cornwall.
- I don't really get that, when groups tour together or even do anything together when they hate each other.
- We have never wrapped ourselves up in our own world thinking we are the only people who know what is doing. We listen to other things and see what we would like and what would suit us.
- You can be normal if you choose to be.
- The amount of women we've met that say that we were an inspiration to them growing up, has always been one of the best things about being in the band.
- There are more important things in life than being thin, anyway men prefer women with a bit of meat.
- We've always written from personal experiences.
- We didn't know it was going to be a career - it was just a lot of fun. We were known as the bimbo band and never expected to last.
- Finding out I was expecting a child was highly inconvenient for doing all the promotion for 'Venus.'
- I guess that people can't imagine three girls just getting up off the streets and making a career for themselves without someone to help them - which is what we did.
- I might have been told to put a comb through my hair once or twice - by my mother!
- When we first were working, we had no money. We were all sharing this ghastly flat and we had nothing.
- It never worked having a management style where someone would try to tell us what to do. It's never been the sort of group that we are.
- It's really odd, but whatever we do and whatever style we might tackle, we always sound like us.
