- 'Paper Planes' by M.I.A. is very catchy. I like that, but I listen to everything from rap to Lenny Kravitz to Coldplay, depending on my mood. And my favorite song of all time is 'Always and Forever' by Heatwave.
- As a black woman trying different products and figuring out what works best for me, the one thing that I realized is that hair brands lump us together as having 'black hair,' but all black hair is not alike.
- I try to eat good; I really do. It's really about moderation.
- The funny thing is, people only know me for having straight hair for work, but I live in Atlanta where it's hot and humid in the summertime. So when I'm home, I wear my hair natural. My hair is naturally curly; I don't have a relaxer.
- Everyone has their own different life experiences which make them who they are. No two people's life experiences are the same. And mine are just unique to me.
- If my skin is feeling a little dry, I use La Mer face cream. I also love their Eye Concentrate. It goes on with this little metal ball thing that's very refreshing.
- I would definitely be interested in doing a cooking show or something related to cooking, and I think probably most immediately, I would do a cookbook.
- My mom didn't believe in putting chemicals in hair. But when I got to college, we didn't have A/C in our dorms freshman year. So after several days of waking up looking like a Chia Pet, I was like 'OK, I'm gonna get a perm.' And then my hair revolted and fell out. I was over that quick, fast and in a hurry.
- Honestly, I just try to live right, get enough sleep, and drink a lot of water. I do drink a lot of water; I do live by that. And just eating good clean food... I do love all of it. But I do definitely try to eat better organic food.
- To me, it's about good work, a good story, and tastefully done. There's so many stigmas - oh, you're on the small screen or you do films or you do reality. It's about the project and not the medium on which it's delivered. It's the story you tell, period.
- My parents and my family really tried to maintain as much of a normal environment as possible. When I went home, it wasn't Keshia Knight Pulliam the actress, the glitz, the glamour. It was Keshia the daughter. Oldest of four children, who washed the dishes and did everything she was supposed to do.
- I love Dior products. They have this Capture Totale One Essential Skin Boosting Super Serum that gives you fresh, glowing, dewy skin.
- I don't live in L.A. I actually live in Atlanta, Georgia. After I graduated from Spelman, I just stayed and never left. And I love it.
- I'd rather laugh - not fuss and fight. You can articulate your point without arguing. When you're arguing constantly, you just need to say, 'You're real cool, but you're not for me.'
- On my body, I use Kai body butter. It smells really nice and it's fresh and creamy. When it's really cold out, I go with some good ol' Nivea cream.
- I'm single, and I hate dating.
- I think Mr. Cosby has always been very much an activist and a big proponent of African-American pride. That's how 'The Cosby Show' came about. I think in his older years, he has gotten a lot more direct and vocal about it. But I think he only wants the best for all of us.
- The stories on 'The Cosby Show' transcend time.
- I've never gone to culinary school, but I do love cooking.
- I don't know if there is a 'lack' of good black men. But when you haven't taken the time to get to know yourself, be OK with you, and articulate what it is you want in a relationship, then you can't possibly find that person for you because you don't even know what you're looking for.
- I don't understand anorexia; I'm too greedy to ever not eat... I just can't do it.
- What people forget is that I'm an actress. That's the wonderful thing about what I do. I get to play different roles.
- I definitely try to live my life in a very fearless manner, but there are no other sports that you jump from a three-story building and land on your hands! Diving is a lot like life. You just have to trust in what you know and allow it to happen.
- A fabulous pair of shoes? I have to have willpower.
- 'The Cosby Show' - no one thought there's doctors and lawyers who are married and live in brownstones! Back then no one would have thought we would have an African-American president. They would have laughed in your face.
- Once you know the fundamentals of cooking, then you don't need to follow a recipe - you just know what herbs go well or what meats, or what combination of what goes together, and then you can just branch out from there. But if there's something specific that I want to make, I work on the recipe and tweak it to my own.
- No matter what your hair looks like once it's wet, it's about embracing it and loving yourself for you and all that that entails.
- I would love to be remembered as a wonderfully dynamic and multitalented actress who left a legacy through her work and through her life of helping people and of being a positive force in the world.
- If Janet Jackson does the story of her life and I'm still young enough, I am there. No one can pull her off like I can. I have a dance background. I'm definitely not cutting an album anytime soon, but I can lip-synch all day. I can't sing, but I can act like it very well.
- Girls will go out and spend $200 or $300 dollars on a pair of shoes, but you should also be taking care of your skin. That's the first thing people see. I think it's an investment. It's a lot cheaper to use really great products now, rather than trying to fix problematic skin later on in life. That's always been my motto.
- I like the joy when you feed people and they're happy and full and enjoying themselves.
- I love watching the National Geographic channel. That show 'Taboo'? I love it!
