- For us, our musical journey has just been a progression. We're not trying to grow up too fast or anything, and I'm saying that even coming from being married. For us, we're growing up with our audience.

- It was funny because right before the whole band broke up, like, we were seven months' pregnant, so my life was going to transition anyway, whether the band was continuing or not.
- Each year when we set up a new tour, we kind of push ourselves to come up with new ideas and new exciting things.
- A lot of people don't post about their kids or do anything. With us, we are so proud and so blessed to have our children, and we also know how happy we are, that I feel like we would love to share it. We are not trying to exploit anything in any way; honestly, I am just proud of my kids and just happy to have them.
- We didn't tell anyone we had gotten signed, because people can freak out a little. But we started working with writers.

- Being discovered by an audience is an incredibly difficult thing.
- Our shows are just like that. The screaming is constant, nonstop, and there's not one minute of silence during the show. It's pretty intense.
- We're not one of those groups who have one song on the radio and, boom, they're an instant success. We worked hard from day one and didn't get a lot of respect, possibly because of the way we were marketed.
- The songwriting did come naturally; it really did. Like Joe said, the first song we ever wrote together was the song that got us signed, you know, so it was either luck, fate, or something in between.
- It's awesome to play 1 1/2 -hour shows because it's so much fun, and we enjoy every single minute of it.

- Dani's family are great, and I'm really lucky to have them as in-laws. But it's definitely not all plain sailing. They are such big characters who aren't scared to speak their mind, and we have different points of view at times, so we have to work through that.
- Moms are sometimes the craziest because they know they want to get their daughters to be seen by us or get an autograph.
- The online thing has been really big for us: the YouTube videos, the MySpace.
- We all had our strengths. I focused on mine, which was kind of the business side of things and more about the touring and the creative... Nick was all about the music, and Joe was about the entertainment aspect and the music.
- Anyone with a cellphone essentially is their own broadcast network. If you can build a reach for yourself, you're essentially an influencer.
- We were a band way before we ever did anything with Disney.
