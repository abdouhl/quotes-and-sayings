- You really have to be ambitious and have that drive to really become well known and successful as a standup.

- I worked for a temp agency called Manpower.
- Curb Your Enthusiasm, is not so much about Hollywood. It's more about Larry's weaknesses.
- With music, you're laying it all out there. They're judging you right away, and you can lose them quick. With the comedy, you've always got another joke to redeem yourself.

- I've done this commercial with Arnold Palmer. He doesn't play that much anymore, but it'd be fun to have him in the cart.
- Don't play dead with a vulture. That's exactly what they want.
- I'm a member of the Studio City Driving Range. They have a nice little par-3 AstroTurf course and driving range. You know, I don't belong to a course because I don't golf that much, so it's not worth it for me to join a club.
- You don't want to throw out a good idea and have nobody get excited about it. It takes the wind out of your sails.
- I do have a place in my heart for animal shelters because the job they have is impossible - so many animals that need to euthanized because don't have homes for them.
- I think I definitely would have ended up in some kind of show business. I was very interested in music when I was younger. This was back when Crosby, Stills and Nash were around.
- Sometimes people come to my standup show, and they think they're going to see Doug Wilson. Or they see me on the street, and they call me Doug Wilson.
- I grew up watching stand-ups and thought it was so entertaining and unique - you didn't see that as a job description anywhere.
- I always tell people if you think you are susceptible to a blood clot, go check with your doctor.
- I feel guilty: when I'm not golfing, I feel like I should be golfing. And when I'm golfing, I feel like I should be home working or spending time with the family. So it's a real conundrum.
- It was football I enjoyed most. When I moved to L.A. to become a stand-up comedian, I thought it might be a good comedy hook to also be the punter for USFL club The L.A. Express, so I started practicing for the tryouts. Luckily, my stand-up took off, and I didn't need to do it.
- It is a great rush to come up with a joke that gets a good response from the audience. It's gold!

- I am whelmed, and not overly whelmed, just whelmed about a lot of facets in life - just how fragile life is and the different challenges you have in life, phobias about things.
- My adrenaline is definitely going, but it's mostly my real, laid-back persona carrying over on stage. When I first started, I was nervous, I'd be really high energy, and I'd be sweating. Now it's just my job. It's like a machinist who goes to work every day and uses the same drill bits. He's not worried about taking his finger off.

- I became a vegetarian after I became aware of factory farming and slaughterhouses and the torture and inhumane handling of all these animals.

- I think there's a part of me that might be my alter ago, like the carefree, do-what-he-wants kind of guy, because I've been so restrained most of my life, going to Catholic school and being the good son and the good husband. It's a fun escape route for me sometimes to lead that life.
- When I first began doing TV pilots, my expectations were high. I didn't understand that world. So when 'Weeds' took off, I was so happy. Especially as I was just a guest star in the pilot. But once it got picked up, they made me a regular cast member.
- When I was very young, I didn't really write my own material. I just memorized other peoples' jokes. Established comics, like Stanley Myron Handelman and people like that. And then, for every comic, you develop your own style after a while.
- When you discover that you are going to have a child, it stirs up memories of your own childhood.
- I see the love in my child's eyes when he sees me, and I know it's gigantic. As an older person, I've been in love before, and I've loved, but this is really an immense, out-of-control-proportion amount of love that you can't even describe.
- Basically, I'm a people pleaser who has a knack for disappointing.
- What happened was, I always wanted to be a singer/songwriter kind of guy like a James Taylor or Crosby, Stills and Nash type of thing; I went to a lot of coffee houses and used to watch all those guys, but I never had the nerve to get up and do it because singing seems so personal and intimate to me. It was too revealing.
- I play a lot of sports. I'm not real good at any of them. I'm above adequate.
- I loved working on 'Happy Gilmore' because I love to travel to new places and we got to go to British Columbia. Any Adam Sandler film is fun to work on because it is a reunion of the boys club of guys that have worked together in the past.

- I'm Kevin Nealon, and that's news to me.

- A novel is too much of a commitment. I tend to peruse Twitter - I check to see if I had any mentions and read the latest messages.
- I have a severe addiction to 'Angry Birds.' I always tell myself, 'One more game...' But then there's always another and another and another.
- I was born in St. Louis; I lived there for three weeks and then my father graduated from St. Louis University, so we all got in the car and split. I don't really remember much.

- It's kind of fun when you're playing characters that aren't quite on the up and up and people still like you.

- When I began doing stand-up, it took me a long time to get an hour's worth of material together.
- The funny thing about commercials to me is that many of them now don't even mention the product until the very end. You don't really know what the commercial is all about. They're kind of like little movies, like shorts, and that's why I think they're so entertaining.
- People recognize me once in a while and appreciate the work. It gets a little embarrassing, but it's good. If you work as an accountant, you don't have people coming up to you in the streets saying, 'Hey, great job on tax statements!'
- I look back at 'Saturday Night Live' and I think, some people didn't like me doing 'Weekend Update.' Who cares? A lot of people did. When you're reaching that many people, you're not going to have everybody like you.
- If you want a transcript of tonight's program, get a pen and write down everything I said.
- To this day, I haven't felt like I've made it. I'm waiting for them to pull the rug out from under me. I kind of feel like George Plimpton; I'm just experiencing this whole business with the really talented people.
- I met Adam Sandler through 'Saturday Night Live,' and we became friends.
- I recently purchased an iPad 2 because I didn't want to wait for the iPad 3 and iPad 4.

- I don't feel the pressure and stress of having to be a comic in a club every night. I accomplished a lot of things; I did lot of things, and I don't feel like I'm missing out when I am home with my son.
- When I would see my friends with their kids, I was envious that you can use children to get out of just about anything. If you don't feel like going to a dinner party, you could say, 'My kid's sick. I can't make it.' Who's gonna argue with you?
- I like YouTube; it's really entertaining. A lot of it is crappy stuff, but there are a couple diamonds in the rough there.
- Any day that is designated to shower the person you love with love is my favorite holiday.
- My heart started running away, like a pack of horses. Then it slowed down and became irregular.
- When a show has been on for so long, you lose fans, you gain fans. I remember this from 'Saturday Night Live.'
- You see things through a different lens when you have a child.
- I think people really appreciate clever commercials, as do I. I think they're very entertaining. You just have to wade through all the garbage. That's one of the reasons people watch the Super Bowl. A lot of them watch it to see the commercials and not the actual game.
- Never wear a red t-shirt to Target. I enjoy helping people, but not every two minutes.
- Definitely not a TV junkie. I only record shows I want to see but usually never get around to watching them.
- The thing is when I started doing standup, you had to have a clean act because that's how you got on television. There weren't all these cable shows. Also, I didn't want to have that kind of act in case my family came to see me or my kid one day.
