- The best way to be productive is to have a great team. So I spend more time than most CEOs on human resources. That's 20 percent of my week.
- I don't have an office. I sit in a cubicle with everybody else. That's partly so no one can ask for an office, which in a fast-growing company isn't practical. But it's also so I can keep my finger on the pulse of how people are feeling.
- I heavily overinvest in recruiting. I have an understanding with certain search firms that if you find someone great, don't wait until there's a job opening - send him to me.
- I used to think business was 50 percent having the right people. Now I think it's 80 percent.
