- I find that I'm much more of a healer than I am anything else.
- People aren't really mean to me, but people say random things.

- The thing about having an amazing stylist - it's not about who is better: it's more so about your body type finding amazing pieces, but also, setting the tone for what people believe is your life. It's like the editing of a movie or the color-correcting of a photo.

- You have to decide what it is that shapes and defines you. I'm a big sister and a co-parent with my mom before anything. That's my root of all. It's my foundation.
