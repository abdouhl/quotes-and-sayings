- On the same day I was sworn in as Prime Minister of Canada, I announced the most sweeping reform ever undertaken in the structure of our federal government.

- It would be naive to imagine we have solved all our income security problems simply because the roles of the federal and provincial governments in the area of skills training have been clarified.
- I have always believed governments must adapt to the needs of the people, not the other way around.
- Our first Prime Minister saw a country that would be known for its generosity of spirit. And so it is.
- There is no greater honour than to serve Canadians.
- Canada is the homeland of equality, justice and tolerance.
- To suggest that Quebecers willingly give up the chance to exercise fully their influence within the federal government would be to betray the historical role Quebec has always played in Confederation, and to undermine the legitimacy of their pride and ambitions.
