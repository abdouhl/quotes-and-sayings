- There have been many moments over the last year when I thought it was all over.
- Obviously I'm very disappointed. I trained very hard this summer and felt in a good shape to play the U.S. Open.
- I've been practicing for a while now and physically trying to get in better shape as well after the injuries.
- I have a daughter and a family.
- These were the moments when I was disappointed and frustrated, when I got so low because it seemed all my hard work had been wasted. But the moments passed, and the motivation to go back to rehab was there again.
- It makes you also realize, 'OK, I'm excited to play tennis, and I work really hard to be the best tennis player I think I can be,' but I don't waste my time on stupid stuff, you know what I mean.
- I would love to do well one last time in Melbourne and my dream would be to win Wimbledon and play in the London Olympics.
- Physically, I feel extremely well, perhaps fitter than ever.
- When I was younger I used to be devastated if I would lose.
- I know that I'm going to have to work hard, keep working hard, and not because of this victory think, 'I'm back.' I don't think like that. I'll definitely work hard. Things are not going to be easy. I might lose first round next week. You never know.
- I am happy to have played a match and break the rhythm of daily training.
- All my time in rehab has made me appreciate tennis more than ever.
- People get so stressed and nervous and mad.
- We have a tough schedule this summer, so I have to plan my schedule wisely if I want to be able to last throughout the season.
- So far, and today, everything felt really great. Now I am good to get on the plane and fly to Australia.
- It's been a year of many more downs than ups.
- I'm happy I was able to stick through it and was being very disciplined with what I had to do, because I know eventually hard work will pay off. It's only a matter of now just trying to make sure I get matches under my belt and I feel more and more comfortable playing matches.
- I've worked really hard, but it's definitely not been easy.
- I said in my mind, 'keep fighting.'
