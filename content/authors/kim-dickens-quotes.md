- I wish I was more of a song-and-dance girl. I sang in a show once. I wish I could be in 'Hair.'
- I'm a country girl; I like country music. That's what my car radio is on.
- When you're guest-starring on another show, it really requires you to jump through hoops in a way, because you're servicing the stories of the main characters. You have to be able to portray a lot of different elements. You show up and get on board and get on their journey; you have to be flexible as to what they need for the role.
- I love football movies.
- I was a waitress years ago when I was first trying to become an actress, waiting tables in New York City.
- Steve Zahn and I like to go to dinner, and we love to go to Chef Donald Link's Herb Saint.
- I have to say, not a day goes by when I don't think fondly about 'Deadwood' and miss things about it.
- I like country music. I'm not going to lie. I'm from the South, and I grew up on it. My dad was a country singer-songwriter, so it's in my blood, and I love it.
- I don't like all of the contemporary country. I like some of it, but I'm mostly into the traditional style.
- Pilot season tends to be grueling, because you can be thrown all of these auditions at once - last-minute, always - and you're going on three a day, especially back in the day.
- I started out in New York, and New York has a way of countering a Southern accent, naturally; when I moved to Los Angeles for a job, and I just stayed, the dialect out here doesn't really counter, and my Southern started coming back.
- If you went to school in Nashville, you were aware of all those '60s rockabilly people.
