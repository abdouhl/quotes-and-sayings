- I love Bob Marley so much. Honestly, all of Madonna's discography. She has so many amazing, fun songs. Or Cyndi Lauper. The thing is, at the same time, I also love listening to Lana Del Rey all the time, the saddest thing you can do to yourself.
- I get my inspiration for my songs and the lyrics from experiences in my life, but I'm also very inspired by the Beatles and Cyndi Lauper, as I really like their music.
