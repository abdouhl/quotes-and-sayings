- One day, I found this book at a used bookstore with 'Satanic Bible' written on the cover, and I thought maybe I should read it and see what it is. I thought it was like a religion, but then I read the book, and what was in it was pure life philosophy - and it was a life philosophy that described how I felt at that point.
- Taking walks sometimes bring back memories of my childhood because a smell might trigger a memory.
- I see myself as a spiritual person, but I don't think anyone should claim proof of a god. No one can prove it. That's why I don't claim to know whether there are one, many or no gods.

- I am actually a trained lab assistant.
- Texas is more laid back, like Denmark is. So it was easier to adjust to that than to Los Angeles or New York for me.

- I don't believe in heaven, and I don't believe in hell as a place with flames where people are burning and having eternal pain. I don't believe in that at all. I believe in a place I call 'beyond.'
