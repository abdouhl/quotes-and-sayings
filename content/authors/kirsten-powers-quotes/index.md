- Hypocrisy, something Jesus railed against, has become perhaps the most prominent feature of the religious right in the Trump era.
- Higher education should provide an environment to test new ideas, debate theories, encounter challenging information, and figure out what one believes.
- I think we have to remember that the white patriarchal system actually benefits white women in a lot of the ways and they're attached to white men who are benefiting from the system that was created by them, for them, and their fathers and their husbands and their brothers are benefiting from the system and so they are also benefiting.
- Leading up to Election Day 2008, candidate Barack Obama declared, 'We are five days away from fundamentally transforming the United States of America.' Conservatives heard a menacing threat. For liberals, it was a rallying cry. The battle was on.
- American Christians are quite able to organize around issues that concern them. Yet religious persecution appears not to have grabbed their attention, despite worldwide media coverage of the atrocities against Christians and other religious minorities in the Middle East.

- Women are often forced to maintain good relations with men who abuse them precisely because those men have power.

- I think my whole life had centered on Democratic politics. I was very much in that bubble. I worked in the Clinton administration so I had all these friends from there, and then in Democratic politics in New York, so that's what we sort of bonded over - that was our religion, to a certain extent.
- Domestic policy, foreign policy, I tend to come down more on the liberal side.
- I'm a registered Democrat, I've always been a registered Democrat, only ever voted for a Democrats.

- One question predominates among Democratic voters assessing which candidate to nominate as the Democratic standard-bearer for 2020: 'Can they beat Donald Trump?'
- It's time for some equal-opportunity accountability. Without it, the fight against media misogyny will continue to be perceived as a proxy war for the Democratic Party, not a fight for fair treatment of women in the public square.
- Whereas Hillary is continually reinventing herself and her campaign, throwing things against the wall to see what sticks, Sanders appears to be driven by core values. He's running because he wants to upend a broken system. She's running because she thinks it's her turn.
- While many liberals have dismissed the idea of political correctness as a right-wing manufactured hysteria, it is in fact a real thing.
- Perhaps all of our anxiety is not caused by broken brains but by working nonstop, missing out on time with our friends and families because we are all so busy 'hustling' and 'grinding' just to survive in an immoral economic system skewed to favor a very few at the top while leaving the rest of the country to fend for itself.
- It was many years until I started meeting other people who were like me: very progressive-minded politically but also very conservative theologically.

- I had a lot of ideas about conservatives and then I got to Fox and just, I was like, 'Oh, they're not all evil and stupid.'
- Trump may not like the fact that 20-plus anonymous sources provided the 'Times' with an unflattering portrait of his campaign, but that doesn't make it 'false.' Of course, Trump had no problem with news outlets running with his made-up claim in 2011 that President Obama 'doesn't have a birth certificate.'
- When illiberal feminists aren't delegitimizing female dissenters from their worldview as fake women, they are portraying them in such a hyper-sexualized way that they are reduced to nonhuman objects.

- It's true that Americans are less than thrilled with President Obama and congressional Democrats. Their approval ratings are nothing to celebrate. But electoral politics is a zero-sum game. If one side loses, then the other side wins. Success depends on being just slightly less odious than your opponent.
- I know I deal with it, I'm sure a lot of other people deal with it: you have that little funny dig you want to give on Twitter or you want to put in your column. Don't do it. it always undermines your argument.
- Women cannot be equal participants in a society that views sexual assault and sexual harassment the way Donald Trump and his defenders do.
- Rather than teach women how to negotiate with sexists or shrink themselves down to 'likeable' size, perhaps the solution would be for employers to stop being sexist. In the meantime, women will continue to be blamed for their lower salaries.
- Military action is, of course, sometimes necessary to maintain peace. Kosovo and World War II are good examples.
- In our pugilistic take-no-prisoners era, preaching grace toward those on the other side of the political fence is decidedly countercultural.
- Trump loves free speech only when he or his supporters are speaking.
- The average religious person has their beliefs, but they're not trying to get people fired who don't have their beliefs. But zealots do do that. It's not enough for them to believe it; they can't tolerate other people who don't believe what they believe, and they have this absolute certainty that they're right.

- Illiberal feminists turn simple ideological disagreements, whether about the federal budget or the Second Amendment or anything else, into excuses to engage in character assassination, dismissing their opponents as sexists.
- The media is not the most Christian-friendly place in the world for the most part. At the same time, a lot of these Christians bring it on themselves.
- The root of nearly every free-speech infringement on campuses across the country is that someone - almost always a liberal - has been offended or has sniffed out a potential offense in the making.
- If I had a dollar for every time somebody said, 'I don't understand: how can you be a Democrat and be a Christian?' I'd be a millionaire.
- It is a lot harder to write a good book or a good column in a persuasive way without making fun of someone or ridiculing them.
- A lack of grace involves much more than critiquing an opponent. It looks a lot more like the ad hominem attacks the president launches nearly daily against all who aren't actively worshiping him. It looks like Trump's relentless attempts to pit Americans against one another.

- Strangely, while illiberal feminists treat conservative women as men in drag, men who identify as women are treated as women.
- It's not hard to see how accusations against Trump as a racist and misogynist would be met with eye rolls and knowing murmurs of 'political correctness' by people who have had their worldview constantly caricatured and demonized by the cultural elites in academia, media and politics.
- Donald Trump has a curious understanding of what freedom of speech means.
- I grew up in the Episcopal Church in Alaska, but my belief was superficial and flimsy.
- In Trump's mind, women derive their primary value from how they look, which is probably why he owned a major beauty pageant for so many years.
