- A concert is a concert is a concert is a concert. An album is an album is an album is an album. Musically, both have nothing in common.
- How did this or that change my music? The only time I have to think about it is when an interviewer asks me that.
- Most of today's music is done electronically.
- The human voice is the first and most natural musical instrument, also the most emotional.
- My interest in his new toy, the Theremin, isn't very big. It simply does not fit into my way of playing music. I do not want to fiddle around with my hands in the air.
- Every music - except dance music, which is for dancing, I suppose - is for the spirit of the human being, and not for the body.
- When I came back I had to realize that IC was not in a very good shape - all the much money that we had because of the huge Ideal success, was gone. I was very upset.
- Everything changes permantly. How boring if it wouldn't.
- We are all part of a tradition, at least we depend on the past.
- As everyone else, I was a fan of Pink Floyd in the sixties.
- As always in a musical collaboration: One has to like each other. As simple as that.
- And of course, the musician - if he's serious - always answers: My last album is my best, otherwise I wouldn't have done it.
- I had to realize that the use of samples has its rules, too.
- Yes, sampling has changed not just my way of playing and composing.
- I listened to the rock music of that time, but as you know and can easily hear: my music of that era had nothing to do with the common music of this era. I was experimenting, I was searching for something new.
- Because, also the world of showbiz is not just black and white, good and bad.
- Yes, I'm a musician. I also like to play with others, sometimes more, sometimes less.
- I did not start IC and Inteam to have control over my music. I had control before and after.
- Yes, I was invited to make the sound environment at a booth of a huge electronic company, during the Hanover Industrial Fair in 1973. It was a job. Slightly good paid. But not as much as my producer then told the press.
- Manuel is still today a good friend. The others I see rarely, but with Edgar I phone from time to time.
- I never had many problems to do my music and to give it to a record company. Rarely do they try to argue with me about my music, probably because it's still too far-out.
- Sometimes I like to make music together with a singer or with singers.
- Then, in 1983 I went on a very long concert tour all over Europe.
- The problem was the journalists who also did not understand much of my music, but they wrote about it. I think you fell into the usual trap laid out by parts of the press and other writers: that the poor musician has always to fight the evil companies and managers.
