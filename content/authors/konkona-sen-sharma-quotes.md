- I did 'Talvar' because I liked the script and my role.

- I don't like this word, 'Feminazis,' or 'libtard.' I don't like these words, because I feel there's no true understanding of the word 'feminism,' there's no understanding of the word 'liberal,' and I find these very derogatory and insulting.
