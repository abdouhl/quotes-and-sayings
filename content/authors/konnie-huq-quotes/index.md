- My mum is your archetypal Asian mum, always feeding people. If there was no food in the cupboard, she'd still manage to rustle up a feast - Bangladeshi food such as pilau rice, curry and korma.
- I have thick hair which is like Plasticine - it's mouldable. So I'll fashion it into some creation that looks presentable. I often wear it down because I have a tiny head and small face, and my hair adds volume to help disguise my pinhead.
- I say throwaway, jokey things. When you're young-looking and you are presenting something that has gravitas you can't look down your nose, but when David Dimbleby does it, it's OK.
- We rip out a perfectly good kitchen worth thousands of pounds, only to replace it with another costing roughly the same. The old one has to be disposed of, the new one had to be made. From raw materials, factory processes and transportation the extra effort is substantial. Overcomplication.
- When we oldies were kids, there was little on offer, food wise, particularly for people with restricted diets.
- Growing up in a Muslim family, I didn't eat pork and was tactically vegetarian at school in a bid to avoid accidentally dining on swine, a galling prospect.
- I've become more cause-driven as I've got older. Maybe that's a result of having kids; you become less carefree and more worried about things.
- I remember as a kid liking long, funny words. And often being into things like that can be perceived as square. But actually, as we know now that we're adults, it's really cool. The more knowledge you have, the better.
- My parents really wanted me to have an arranged marriage when I was younger, but I think they have updated a bit with the times.
- I'd love to rent a private villa in a resort complex with a kids' club.
- I've worn a chainmail suit to swim with sharks, glided over Cirencester with a James Bond-style paramotor strapped to my back, eaten hippo steaks and had a bat dive down my bra. And all the while, I had to face the camera and smile.
- Because Blue Peter can get you access to places - if you go to somewhere like Nasa, you don't just see what most people see, you can get a lot of behind the scenes access. You can talk to an astronaut.
- If you're broke and you're living on the street and you're happy, you're still winning compared to someone who is rich and depressed, because your mental wellbeing is still there.
- Economics is a good degree to have but the subject is very theoretical at Cambridge and I found it frustrating that you can't apply a lot of the models to particular circumstances.
- When I was in the sixth form I presented a cable and satellite programme about music, television and video. I used to do public speaking competitions.
- Life in 'Blue Peter's' world is always presented as happy, positive and fun. It's an adventure that you have to make the kids believe they want to join in. There are no marks for being a scaredy-cat.
- I'm all for education - in fact, I have spent my career extolling its virtues.
- About the only useful thing my economics degree taught me was that, in all decisions in life, you have to do a cost-benefit analysis.
- I used to watch TV in the days that I was on TV. But in that time, streaming has come along. So I can honestly say, I have no idea what's on real-time TV.
- Mental health really is a search to be happy, I think that's what people want in life - and if you're happy you're winning.
- As for other radio, I dip in and out of various channels depending on my mood.
- Let's have a People's Vote to safeguard gender equality and continue the drive towards a fairer world for us all.
- You're an example as a kids' presenter, so there is a responsibility there. But they got lucky with me - I'm not into heavy nights out.
- My parents are proof that arranged marriages can work. It is a great part of my culture but I grew up in a completely different place, so I wouldn't want anyone to arrange a marriage for me.
- An experience that shaped me happened early in my TV career when I filmed in Mozambique, Angola and Bangladesh for 'Blue Peter' and Comic Relief. Places with extreme poverty. When you see that first-hand as a young person, you take it with you for life.
- My A-levels were physics, chemistry and maths. Science is fascinating but I wouldn't say I have used it since then. I decided to do economics.
- Journalists know other journalists - that's the only reason my engagement made it into the papers. I don't think real people are interested - just the media, just Twitter!
- We as parents, and the control culture, it is our responsibility to make sure we give the right perceived norms and the right cultural conditions.
- My dad moved to Britain from Bangladesh in the 1960s to work as an actuary for Prudential. However, after seeing an empty retail space in Soho, he decided to open an Asian restaurant instead, despite not having any business experience.
- My first ever interview for 'Blue Peter' was a film with JK Rowling.
- I think relaxation is escaping from your everyday encounters. You can read the words on a page and be transported to somewhere else. And the more consumed you are with it, the more you're cocooned.
- I don't really worry about things, I'm too busy.
- Getting the spot of 'Blue Peter' changed the path of my life.
- In a 24/7 landscape of rolling news, social media, phone alerts and notifications it's all too easy to feel numbed by all the shouting.
- Me and my husband think the internet is a really positive thing. We know games that have taught our children problem-solving skills but that doesn't mean we are going to say play 'Call of Duty.'
- I've just watched the whole series of 'Flight of the Conchords'. I absolutely love it - the humour, the actors, everything about it.
- The thing about local government is they want to hear what local people think, but for the most part, their systems are so long, dull and bureaucratic that people only get involved when there's an issue they really care about.
- Growing up as the youngest daughter to immigrant parents, it was instilled in me from an early age to not be wasteful and to be respectful of money and possessions.
- I don't really buy a weekly magazine but do flick through them if they're in front of me. A bit of style and a dose of gossip is just what you need sometimes.
- Forget quantitative easing - I've always thought the idea of injecting virtual money into the system is an accident waiting to happen.
- Because my parents are Muslim, there's no doubt they wished I would marry someone Muslim.
- I wear mascara, eyeliner, a bit of foundation and blusher. I always think lip gloss makes you appear properly made-up. Slap it on and suddenly you look glamorous.
- West Wittering in Chichester is perfect for a short break and if I've got longer, Devon and Cornwall are my favourites places in Britain.
- A problem shared is a problem halved, but as with so many problems affecting women - periods, menopause, post-natal depression - we often feel embarrassed, as if we're moaning or just plain wrong to air them.
- An emergency on the labour ward needs to be addressed within minutes or else lifelong disability or even death can follow for the baby or mother.
- I guess when you're on 'Blue Peter' there's that goody-two-shoes image which people find attractive.
- We need to take back control of our political process. We know so much more about what Brexit will mean, and the health implications, especially for those who are already in a disadvantaged position.
- My parents were first-generation immigrants. My mum wore a sari but at school and as a teenager and in my 20s I wanted to fit in.
- I've never been more terrified than when I learned how to paramotor. They attached this machine to my back, as if I was a stuntman in a James Bond movie, and I had to fly over all these trees and patches of concrete in Cirencester.
- It was daunting, giving up a regular job for a freelance world, where every day off is a day of unemployment and you are conscious you are not earning. But it was time to take a gamble and see what's on the other side.
- I was mindful that clothes, objects and items had all been designed and manufactured. Thought had gone into those processes, so to mindlessly treat everything without care or as disposable was disrespectful. Things should be valued.
- I like to wear things that don't need ironing. It seems a fundamental design flaw when clothing needs ironing. There are loads of fabrics these days that don't need ironing, so I stick to those.
- And then I saw this article in 'Time Out' magazine for TV presenters, so I went along with my sisters and we did this audition. It was open auditions, it was just a fun day out, but there were maybe 600 people there or something. It was just crazy.
- I like interiors as much as exteriors but 'interior designer' just sounds naff as a job.
- Imagine owning a one million pound coin. Where would you put it? The pressure. I never even take my wedding rings off after the time I lost one for days, only to find it in a random trouser pocket.
- Motivation levels differ person to person, as does the time since failing new year resolutions.
- I'm lucky in that the media is much more freelancey. So I didn't have that pressure that lots of people have if you jump off the ladder, then you get left behind.
- Food lovers tend to make life difficult for themselves on their travels. It's like travelling first class, if your expectations are so high, you're bound to be disappointed.
- There's enough wealth in the world that no one should go without.
- Having seen many of my friends go through the trial of trying month after month to conceive, then finally the joy of getting pregnant followed by the heartbreak of miscarriage, I know how lonely and isolating it can be to have to go back to square one carrying that heartbreak with you.
- I'm really not aware of much press. I could drive myself mental if I went on the internet. I'd probably overanalyse it anyway. There's so much media that I'd feel bombarded, so I don't pay it much attention.
- In the UK we have general elections roughly every four or five years because we know circumstances, situations and therefore opinions change over time.
- In all aspects of our society we overcomplicate things under the guise of making things easier and simpler, when in fact we are doing the opposite.
- No one went to the ballot box to vote for something worse than the status quo.
- A serious economic downturn will undermine women's rights on multiple levels. And it is the women who are already the most disadvantaged, that will be hit hardest of all.
- Most people don't go around talking about their miscarriages. It's not really something you shout about. What's more, people often feel embarrassed or even guilty about them.
- I don't usually eulogise about people, but I saw Russell Brand doing stand-up before he was really high profile. I didn't really know what to expect but I laughed until my belly ached.
- Ethnic minority women generally have poorer outcomes from their pregnancy compared to white women.
- You see, the thing about us humans is we overcomplicate things. To eat, our food manufacturing processes work on a huge scale, clearing land, rearing livestock, killing it, packaging it. Go big, only to shrink it all back down to small enough to shove in our mouths.
- I'm trying to start reading books that you gain knowledge from in order to challenge myself more. As a rule, I tend to read easy reading/populist-type books, but I don't feel like I'm learning enough.
- My parents grew up in a village where they didn't even have running water. They are first generation immigrants who are proof that arranged marriages can work, although I wouldn't want one.
- By fermenting tiny single-cell organisms we will be able to synthesise all manner of foodstuffs in the future, everything from pasta to eggs, fish and meat. Small tweaks in the process will enable production of different proteins used to replicate food we already eat.
- When they do actually get pregnant, most expectant mothers understandably keep the whole thing a secret because of how fragile the first four months can be.
- The one thing more important to my parents than my career is that I am happily married.
- A Final Say referendum on the Brexit that actually lies in front of us will give everyone a tangible and decisive vote. I and most people, Brexiteers and Remainers alike, want the same thing - the best for the UK.
- Blue Peter' scarred me for life. I was kayak-surfing in Cornwall and the waves were so strong it was more like white-water rafting. I had to hang on for dear life. At one point I let go and my hand was crushed on a rock.
- At eight or nine I passed the exam for Notting Hill and Ealing High, a private school. I had an assisted place; I was always the one who, for financial reasons, didn't go on the skiing trip or whatever.
- I grew up as a Muslim: it was quite a conservative upbringing; I didn't wear mini-skirts. But my mum and dad had a good sense of humour and were creative. I guess all of that shaped me.
- My parents are very proud that I was a 'Blue Peter' presenter and of me going to Cambridge to do economics.
- Back in humanity's hunter-gatherer days, you only ate meat if you'd recently made a kill, which required a huge amount of effort, and was therefore relatively rare. There's a reason humans only have one set of incisors to rip our meat apart: we're not supposed to eat the stuff at every meal.
- My husband Charlie says I get ready five minutes before I go out the door. I am one of those people who can't do anything unless it's imminent - that's how I roll.
- When I was growing up, I always felt a bit like I didn't quite fit in, a feeling that perhaps still lingers in the background to this very day. I was the small brown girl in the big white suburb.
- My husband has a wife who is happy to wander round in old leggings held up with worn elastic. I'm happy with who I am and I'm more concerned with other issues and trying any way I can to make a better world for our children.
- Never mess with other people's kids. You will never win. It's the child's word against yours and they have parental reinforcements as back-up. You just can't triumph.
- Being a 'Blue Peter' presenter is not well paid.
- I'm the youngest of three children and grew up in Ealing, west London. My eldest sister, Nutun, is nine years older than me, and my middle sister, Rupa, is three years older.
- Since I've left 'Blue Peter' I've presented all sorts of different things. I've done a music show, for instance, and 'Blue Peter' had music on it. I've done a politics show, but on 'Blue Peter' I interviewed the Prime Minister. I've done travel stuff where I've gone abroad, but 'Blue Peter' had that within it as well.
- From a young age I was really into pop music because I had these two older sisters who were into it, and I wanted to be like them. They liked Wham! and so I was really into them too.
- I have surreal dreams, so much so that I can never make head nor tail of them.
- In general, I think we're more or less shaped and formed by our late 20s. Things come along during that time that make us cynical. By the time you're in your 30s, it's hard to unpick those mindsets that have formed. It takes years of therapy to undo them.
- The internet creates a mask and you are talking to people who you don't necessarily know.
- Increased tariffs and a weakened pound would mean higher food prices, hurting the poorest families - and the women trying to make ends meet at the heart of them - the most.
- There were no small brown kids as the centre of the children's fiction I grew up with.
- I did this show for Sky called 'King of the Nerds', which was a reality show looking for the world's biggest nerd, essentially, celebrating the geek, which is also what I'm about.
- I had an instamatic wind-on camera and remember buying the flashcubes and fixing on top of the frame. The flash credits were limited so you had to be careful not to waste any.
- I remember being in Vietnam in my early 20s, at the height of Lonely Planet's fame, and all the travellers would converge on internet cafes to send emails back home. It was a great place to exchange tips and recommendations, so you actually interacted with people.
- I do sometimes like cheesy music like 'Africa' by Toto; naff songs and music.
- The brilliant thing about 'Blue Peter' is the variety of the stuff you do and the experiences that you have, just amazing experiences.
- If, as statistics suggest, millennials' diets are more plant-based than ever, and we continue to bring up our kids to eat less or no meat, the future could be bright - the future could be vegan.
- One minute you're up a mountain, the next you're down a well. One minute you're with Tony Blair, the next you're with McFly. Ten years feels like two years when you're in the 'Blue Peter' bubble.
