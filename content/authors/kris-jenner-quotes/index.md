- Kendall is really satisfied on her role in 'Keeping Up With the Kardashians.' With her modeling career, she's so busy. If she's not walking a runway, she's shooting a campaign or traveling around the world with her fashion obligations. She's a pretty busy little girl.
- For years, people had been saying, 'You guys should have a reality show - it would be crazy,' and I didn't pay much attention to that talk, but the idea did stay in the back of my mind.
- I raised my kids kind of old-fashioned - if you don't have something nice to say, then don't say it at all. I teach love, acceptance, and tolerance... I sometimes think that this generation is lacking in decency.
- I say this all the time, but when I go to bed at the end of the day, and I put my head down on the pillow, I really feel such a sense of satisfaction, and I'm so proud of my kids that they have this amazing work ethic, and we get to work with each other every day, so it doesn't get any better than that.
- The goal for my girls and me has always been about beauty and fashion. Before we ever had the shows, my mom had a store for 40 years in La Jolla, and I grew up working there.

- I learned a lot in my life by paying attention and listening to how people around me worked.
- We have literally millions and millions of fans. I mean, even Kendall and Kylie have 50 million followers on Instagram - apiece. That's a hundred million people you have somehow touched emotionally, enough to follow you on a social-media platform. And I think with that also comes, you know, haters.
- I believe in God and the power of prayer.
- I keep track of my kids sometimes with social media. I have to check TMZ every morning to see what's going on, and then at night, I go to bed with Snapchat.

- I believe that, no matter how old you are, a woman can look amazing.
- Costco is a passion. Costco is like a massage.
- My motivation is to be creative and have fun. You want to do something that keeps you on your toes the rest of your life and keeps you busy.
- When the opportunity came along to do the reality show, it was just a very exciting time. We really never thought about how it would pan out for the entire family but just knew that it was going to be a great journey.
- Kim was the one who taught us how to use Twitter and how to engage and really capture the attention of followers and the fans.
- And I think that, given the opportunity, somebody could really learn a lot just being around me and the girls because it's really nonstop, 24/7 brainstorming and creativity and just trying to get organized and really pack a lot into a day - being there nonstop with all engines blazing.
- There's a lot of people that have great ideas and dreams and whatnot, but unless you're willing to work really, really hard, and work for what you want, it's never going to happen.

- The girls grew up playing in my closet - trying on my shoes, etc. Now the tables have turned.
- When my kids are happy, I am happy.
- Oh, my goodness, I am obsessed with Costco! We do runs at least twice a week. I love the salmon and rotisserie chicken, the dog beds.
- I like everything a certain way. I'm not somebody who can just lay back and let it happen... And I think that's what's gotten me to where I am in life.
- It's important for my kids to see our family strong and united.

- One of the first things I said to my kids and we all agreed upon when we first started shooting the show was if we're going to do this, we're all in. We're not going to worry about editing ourselves. So that's what you see. It's raw, and it's real, and it's footage that hopefully people learn from some of our experiences.

- There are a lot of big personalities in our family, and because of the way that we interact with each other - and the fact that the girls are beautiful, the little ones are adorable, and my husband is an Olympic champion - there was this perfect storm, where I think you kind of wanted to watch and go, 'Wow, what's happening with this family?'
- Khloe is amazing! I'm so proud of that kid.
- When I was young, I loved shopping at a store on Rodeo Drive called Lina Lee. Shopping there made me feel so special.
- Anything I ever wanted, I had to work really hard for. I learned the value of saving my money, trying to make something happen, and being entrepreneurial, even as a really young girl.
- I love the creative process and being able to build something out of nothing.
- I'm there to support my kids no matter what happens. I just do the best I can, just like anybody else would for their family.
