- The hallmark of my books is the relationships that define women's lives.
- I am such a Pacific Northwest girl.
- Whenever I write about motherhood - and I write about it a lot - I am drawing on my experiences as a mother and also my experiences as a daughter.
- We women. as glue for the family. lead lives that are important and conflicted. What we women choose to give up for our families is important and valid.
- A romance novel focuses exclusively on two people falling in love. It can't be about a woman caring for her aging mother or something like that. It can have that element, but it has to be primarily about the male-female relationship.
- Sitting around and waiting for your muse is not the best choice.
- I can be a little OCD when it comes to my writing.
- What I know now about life is this: your mother is a part of everything you do and everything you are.
