- That's why I'm never happy. Every tragedy, I really feel very painful - especially about a child or old people. This is reality. We try to close eyes and ears, but it's happening every second, and somehow, unfortunately, I feel a connection.
- I am a good wife, so I think we need to live where my husband is working.
- I didn't want to be Nelsons's wife. I wanted to be soprano Kristine Opolais.
- I'm very emotional: to lose love is the same as dying.
- My voice is not angel voice.
- You can make a debut in 25 operas. But to make a debut at the Metropolitan Opera is huge.
- Having a child changes everything.
- When I go onstage, every situation I have to play, I feel pain. When I sing 'Madama Butterfly' I feel completely everything she felt: It's horrible.
- Puccini is my favorite composer.
- I wrote my own pop songs and sang one of them when I went into a stupid beauty competition when I was 16. That was my public debut, and it made my mother even more determined that I should go into opera!
- I hate everything that is rigid. I need freedom.
- Every normal woman that is a mother will do everything for your baby to make sure he is happy. Every mother understands that the baby is only happy being with his or her mother.
- Sometimes directors come to me when I have to play some horrible thing, scary or hysterical or crying; they ask, 'Did you study somewhere to be an actress?' No, this is life. That's why I think I don't want to say you need a really bad experience to be a good artist, but bad experiences in your life say something.
- Someone was always trying to put down my individuality and personality, making me sing Mozart arias that were nothing to do with me.
- As a person who wants to see and believe in the story, I don't think women at age 50 are able to sing young girls.
- The point is that I am such a big fan of Puccini and that Butterfly is the most difficult and complete role that you can imagine. Just to sing it with a good voice is not enough: it asks tears from your soul. I am very emotional on stage, and the music is so tender that I suffer for real when I am singing it. So I cannot do many performances.
- Nobody is pushing me. Nobody is telling me what I do.
- I am not playing on stage. I am living the situation. I cannot cut emotions and sing. I never save myself.
- I go through every single emotion. My artistic life will likely be shorter than it could be because everything is for real for me. This is my life and my soul.
- I never wanted to be an opera singer. I wanted to be an actress, maybe a rock singer.
- Maybe I will end up in the movies.
