- One of the things that I tell beginning writers is this: If you describe a landscape, or a cityscape, or a seascape, always be sure to put a human figure somewhere in the scene. Why? Because readers are human beings, mostly interested in human beings. People are humanists. Most of them are humanists, that is.

- I was not an anthropology student prior to the war. I took it up as part of a personal readjustment following some bewildering experiences as an infantryman and later as a prisoner of war in Dresden, Germany. The science of the Study of Man has been extremely satisfactory from that personal standpoint.
- All writers are going to have to learn more about science, because it's such an interesting part of their environment.
- Anything can make me stop and look and wonder, and sometimes learn.

- We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful what we pretend to be.

- It was very lucky for me as a writer that I studied the physical sciences rather than English. I wrote for my own amusement.
