- Usually I feel kind-of normal and lame, and then I'll go to the coffee shop and someone'll say, 'You rock!' And then I'll remember how awesome I am.
- Bo Burnham is great, he's a genius.
- It's always fun to play the hometown.
- Jack is really the new breed, a wild-man comedian. America's funnyman.
- But the classic Tenacious D songwriting is Jack or myself will have an idea - I might have a riff - and we'll improv. And once Jack's feeling it, we turn on the tape recorder and start jamming, improv on that riff, improv on those lyrics, and then go back and see if there's anything good in there.
- I like butter with my popcorn.
- Well, here's my feeling about shtick. I think sometimes if you don't have it going on too much, you're probably feeling insecure and then you want to add on the shtick. I would say, oh, like Kiss. You try to stand out from the crowd, you're going for a bold statement, you're going for a high concept.

- There doesn't seem to be a relationship between budget and comedy. In fact, it might be inverse.

- We used to hang out in my studio apartment, play music and dream about being rock stars.
- People used to think, because of our name, that we were a hip-hop group.
- I've never been married, but I'm imagining what it's like: Sometimes Jack snores, and I get to poke him.
- I don't really like to audition, and that works against me. It's bad to be an actor and not like to audition.
- I like 'The Graduate.' That's one of my favorites.
- Yeah, there's probably been times when I'm watching cable and seeing there's like three movies that Jack's in and I'm sitting hogging a bag of Cheetos in my underwear and I think 'God, what happened to me? Why can't I be something special like Jack?'
- I was excited to be nominated for the Grammy, but prizes are a little strange.
- Jack is a special performer, the kind that comes along once in a generation.
- I can't be serious, apparently.
- Well, we're on a never-ending quest to slim down. It's just very difficult for us.

- I like Popsicles!
- We want to be just like the greatest band. But I think we're just sort of both naturally humorous fellas.
- I'd love to do the straight music thing, but that's kind of against our mission, which is to rebel against the serious singer-songwriter mentality.
- I had a desperate need to be Van Gogh or something. Some tremendous artist. Jack's so successful, what's wrong with me, why isn't this working for me? I hated myself.
- I don't keep up with music.
- I'd like to do a concept album, with the concept being about me.
- I'm doing this pilot called 'Demon.' Kevin Smith is directing it. It's a comedy drama. I play a guy who rises up from Hell.
- A friend is someone who can help you with your career.
- I don't like to audition. I just want people to give me parts.
- I still enjoy watching Jack perform after a gazillion years of watching him.
- We try to write the best songs ever and they kinda come out funny.
- I have an agent and everything. I audition occasionally.
- Probably every band - you get back to like, The Stones are kind of the tough guys, Beatles are kind of psychedelic, Led Zeppelin was kinda mystical, The Who are kind of mods. You know, you just go right through. Everyone's kind of adopted their so-called persona or flavor if you will.

- We're like a rogue satellite circling the comedy universe.
- You can't pick your fans.
- We're not very confident performers, and if we don't get a laugh we get insecure.
- I'd say that acting is a side project for Jack.
- I am such a desperate man headed into a midlife crisis.
- We've been around about 20 years and we only have, what, two records? We're not terribly prolific.
- You know, I come from an acting background.
- We're actually more popular in the U.K.; they really get us, and in Australia. In the non-English speaking countries, they don't really get it.
- I wanted to be an actor. Music was a side project.
- To me, comedy and music are not even really separate entities.
