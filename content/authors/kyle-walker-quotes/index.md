- Pep is highly intelligent.

- I thought it was really important for my son to come to a World Cup with my missus, who has been there for me from day one and supported me.

- I like to think I'm a grown-up, but it's just nice you can have a civil conversation with your boss, you're both on the same page, and you've had a text, not about football, just about golf.
- I needed to prove to myself - to the manager, to the fans, even to my mum and dad - that I'm not just an average player.
