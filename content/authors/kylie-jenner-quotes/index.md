- I can't have brown hair for some reason. I don't think it goes with my skin tone. The second I see it turn brown in the sun, I dye it black - the blacker the better.
- I've realized through the years that I just find happiness in other things, whether it's my dogs or my friends or, like, looking at the sunset. So if I were to wish for something else, it would just to be happy all the time, to have a superpower of not letting things affect me, and to be true to who I am, always.
- I feel like, growing up, I haven't had a lot of room for error - I don't have room to make mistakes. You need to make mistakes to grow and learn, but I'm just a little different because the world is watching me, every single thing I do.
- If you're different, or if you think something about you is just weird and out of the ordinary, I just think that's so dope.
- I like to have fun, I'm silly, and I keep the mood light.
- I'll usually wash my face with a face wash, then I'll go to my makeup. I like to use Nip + Fab Dragon's Blood Fix Serum. It's moisturizing and also a great primer for your makeup. And, I try to use sunscreen every day.
- I just want to inspire my fans to be whoever they want to be, because that's what I've always done.
- My fans and followers are so amazing.
- There is absolutely a side of me that people don't know. I'm not myself on Snapchat or Instagram. That's totally not me.
- I wake up every morning at, like, seven or eight because I think that there's a bad story about me, and I have to check. My worst fear is waking up and finding something bad about me on the Internet.
- I love Armani Face Fabric, Make Up For Ever HD, Rodial Skin Tint and Charlotte Tilbury.
- I'm scared of the day I turn 19. I really don't want to grow past 18.
- I wanted a house near my family in a quiet neighborhood with a front yard and a backyard that my dog will like.
- Having sisters is the best. I have a different relationship with each of them. I go to Kim for fashion advice, Khloe is always boy and family advice, and Kourtney is like another mother to me.
- Everyone asks, 'What's your favorite trend?' And I never answer that.
- Makeup looks better if your skin is not dry. And sometimes, if my skin peels, then it's all just bad. Basically, take care of your skin to make your makeup look nice.
- I'm young, and I'm a girl, so, when I post something, I want to see what people are saying or what they think of my photos. I've found it better if you don't read anything and you just always stay off that track.
- Khloe has the youngest hands. You can tell a woman's age by her hands, and she taught me that. She has way younger hands than I do because she's addicted to wearing sunscreen on them. I'm not consistent with it, but maybe that will be my new year's resolution.
- I know how influential I am over my fans and followers. I feel like everything I do, my hair color, my makeup, I always start these huge trends, and I don't even realize what I'm capable of.
- I will take off my makeup with wipes and then wash my face again. Then, I use a toner, moisturizer, and under-eye cream. I love vitamin E oil and coconut oil.
- Since I was 9 years old, I've been in the entertainment business, and everyone is always telling me what - and what not - to do... you just get a tough skin and have to not care about what people think, or you will not end up in a good place.
- I definitely don't make many friends. It's my choice; I just have a wall. It's not that I have anything against anyone.
- If I'm going to see people, I won't wear heavy makeup. It's not attractive on me. When you see those pictures on my Instagram, they are usually for when I'm doing a photo shoot or an interview.
- Honestly, what I think set everything off is when I cut my hair off when I was 16 and dyed it blue. After that, I just felt so free and wanted to experiment with my look.
- I still feel insecure all the time. I feel like it's just a part of being a human being... I just learned normal is very boring.
- I'm obsessed with Lady Gaga. I saw her at the Alexander Wang fashion show after-party, and I think she's the nicest person ever.
- I really like the Glycolic Cleansing Pads because they're super easy. Sometimes it's annoying to scrub your face with your hands, but these are just little pads, so I like that. I also really like the Kale Fix Moisturizer and Dragon's Blood Fix Serum. The Dragon's Blood is good for priming before your makeup.
- I like lip liners over lipsticks. I have so many of them from so many different brands, so I just pick the color that works.
- I swear there are things you can do to work on problem areas without having to think about plastic surgery.
- I definitely think prom should feel sophisticated. I'm not really into cutouts and all that. I would go for a more simple look - maybe a dark-colored dress and a red lip and long wavy hair; and for nails, a French tip is always classic and cute!
- I'm always down to share my secrets, share my beauty tips. Most of the stuff my fans never knew I get from CVS and stores like that. It's fun sharing all the stuff that I use! I don't use crazy stuff. There's always ways to do it for less.
- I wake up every morning with the worst anxiety. I don't know why. I have, like, a problem.
- I don't think I need a significant other to be happy because I always like to find that for myself, but I think that it makes me a lot happier when I'm sharing my life with somebody.
- I follow all these fashion blogs that are cool and inspire me. I'm not really obsessed with anyone except for the people that I like romantically. I get excited when they post. Sometimes I like to stalk my exes.
- I can't sleep in my makeup. Sometimes I'll be really lazy and try to not think about it and just fall asleep, but I have to take it off and as soon as possible. Sometimes it'll be quick.
- I'm still in school - I'm home-schooled. I do school every day. I finish in, like, four months.
- I love L.A. I'm such an L.A. person.
- Every time I start to get worked up over something, I just think to myself, 'Is this really going to matter in my life tomorrow, in an hour, in a year?' You just can't get stressed about the little things 'cause it's just not worth it at the end of the day.
- I'm not materialistic. I love clothes and all that stuff, but I don't need it to live.
- I take, like, 500 selfies to get one I like.
- Having a reality TV show, everyone feels like they know you, but that's only 10% of my life. There's a whole other side of me that people don't see.
- I'm way flashier on Instagram and Snapchat because I feel like that's what people want to see, and that's I've always done, so I'm not going to stop. People want to see my cars and my purses. People love fashion. But that's so not me.
- I don't really wear perfume. I use Victoria's Secret sometimes. They have this Coconut Passion spray. But fragrances can give me a bit of a headache.
- I feel limited in some ways because I have such young fans. But I'm okay with that; I do everything I want to do.
- Tyga's one of my best friends ever, so it's so much fun to travel with him. I always like having my friends out on the road with me.

- I don't want my fans to think they have to get lip fillers or look like me in any way.
- I love to dance, so I'm definitely always the first one out on the dance floor. And when it comes to guys, I don't get shy. So if I wasn't with a date, I wouldn't have a problem going up to a guy and just saying, 'Are you gonna dance with me?' Trust me, it'll work for you too! Guys like it when you aren't afraid to make the first move.
- When I'm, like, 30, I want to go off the map, have a family and live in Malibu with a farm, and just raise my own chickens.
- I never feel pressure to be a good role model. I always try to do my best to inspire people to be good and do the right thing, but I just can't live my life always trying to be a good role model.
- Working with some of the best makeup artists has taught me a lot of amazing tricks to making me feel more confident, and I can't wait to share them with you guys.

- I have two really great best friends that are the only people I hang out with. I keep a close circle.
- I honestly hate wearing makeup.
- I have a lot of boots. I'm a shoe person for sure.
- I don't really follow trends - I don't like wearing what other people are wearing. I just like to be original!
- There are new rumors about me every day.
- Lips are kind of like my thing, and I've always been obsessed with lipstick and lip liner. I just always went to lip liner to overline my lips, and I feel like I was really known for that. I can't walk out of my house without my lipstick!
- What I think is so amazing about having everything, and feeling like I have everything, is that I don't really find happiness within materialistic things. Like, it's cool if I can buy myself a new car, and I think it's amazing for a week, but then the thrill is over, and I'm like, 'Oh, so I guess that wasn't really happiness.'
- I feel like I'm way too young to wear such heavy makeup all the time. It's just bad for your skin, but I'm always doing photo shoots or red carpets and events, so I obviously want to look good.
- I feel like I've lost so many amazing traits because I've listened to stupid people, ignorant people who are bullies.
- I think that other girls and boys my age will maybe see that I'm so accepting and be accepting of other people, too.
- People have to be sensitive to - I hate using the word 'celebrities' - people in the spotlight. Because there's so much more than what you see on the cover of a magazine.
- Every time I get my makeup professionally done, I take a photo.
- It sucks being judged by the world instead of your close friends or family. I try to just realise that the only people who matter are my family and friends.
- People flash back to pictures of me when I was 12 and say 'Kylie's so different,' but how can I look the same from 12 -18?
- I've been bullied my whole life, whether it was about my peers or comments on Instagram or Twitter, whatever. And I never talked about my story, really. I feel like I've kind of accepted it because I realized that just comes with the territory.
- I'm ready to live on my own. It's a really big step, but I'm ready.
- I don't want to be a bad role model.
- I still do Juvederm for my lips. I go to Dr. Ourian in Beverly Hills. He's the best, and he's super natural about it.
- I'm a brand ambassador. I've been a fan of Nip+Fab for a while, so it fit perfectly. I just love their stuff.
- I change my style maybe every month. I'm, like, punk one month, ghetto fab the next, classy the next. I'm just young and finding out who I am.
- People think they have a perfect idea of who you are from a four-second Snapchat video... and fake blogs, stories, magazine covers. In reality, that's not the case. Nobody knows who I am except family and my close friends.
- The more people love you, the more there's going to be people that hate you.
- I have normal friends. I sit at my house, and they practically live with me, and I watch them get ready to go to a high school party, hang out with their friends, go to concerts.
