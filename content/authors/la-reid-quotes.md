- Listen, we're still selling stardom. That doesn't go away because MTV decides they can't play videos or they want to program themselves more as a traditional T.V. station. Vevo and YouTube are like MTV online, and on demand.
- I am a record executive and I shall be right there in your face with my records.
- World events can shape culture. Music is either a soundtrack for or a narration of changing times. And who knows how that's going to go?
- Popular music has always been rooted in the blues, whether it's Adele or Led Zeppelin or Sam Cooke. It's just the beat that changes.
- I live for opening doors for the young generation of creators. If we do nothing else with our success, let's open up some doors.
- I'm one of those foolish people who believe the glory days of the record industry aren't behind us. They're actually ahead of us.
- The kids I talk to are convinced their generation will make the best music. And the greatest artists have yet to be discovered. I walk around with that thought every day.
- I think of myself as a producer who tries to bring the best out of everyone, whether that be an artist, songwriter or a publicist.
- I was a James Brown junkie as a kid.
- You always have to know when to bow out. You bow out while you are on top.
- I'm personally looking for artists that are along the lines of today's pop stars. Whether it be a Rihanna or a Justin Bieber or a Kanye West or a Beyonce or a Lady Gaga, I'm looking for talent that's like that, that's what I love.
- We don't sign an artist to fill a void, ever. I'll never find a Taylor Swift. You can't find a new Madonna, you cannot find a Prince, a Bob Marley, a John Lennon. You won't find another Kanye West. We simply deal with people as they walk in, and we say we either love them or we don't.
- The deepest and most sincere feeling I get is when I meet an artist and they have that steel in their eyes and they have that fire and that passion and all they want is to be a star and to hear themselves on the radio.
- I'm not a good Samaritan, I'm a businessman... The goal is to read and react. If we sign an artist that has potential for a shelf life way out in the distance, then we'll stay. But if not, then we won't.
