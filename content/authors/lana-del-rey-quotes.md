- I don't know that much about who directs what movies, but I'm definitely inspired by the look of old movies; I find them to be really beautiful.
- I love to sing and I really love to write, but in terms of being onstage, I'm not that comfortable, which I think is sort of clear.
- I was going to Miami quite a lot at the time, speaking a lot of Spanish with my friends from Cuba - Lana Del Rey reminded us of the glamour of the seaside. It sounded gorgeous coming off the tip of the tongue.
- I made that first record in 2008, alongside the EP, but my label at the time waited three years to release it. They thought maybe someone bigger would buy it, but they didn't, so in the end they just released it themselves.
- Seeing myself on the screen makes me cringe. I understand that I am that way - pouty.
- I have kind of a funny relationship with movies. I don't have to see the whole movie to get an impression of it or to let it have an influence on me.

- A lot of the time when I write about the person that I love, I feel like I'm writing about New York.

- When I was young I felt really overwhelmed and confused by the desire not to end up in an office, doing something I didn't believe in.

- I believe nothing happens by mistake. You know, the universe has a divine plan. That sounds dramatic.
- People are really talkative in New York. Someone always comes up to me and says 'Hi' during the day.
- I was always singing but didn't plan on pursuing it seriously. When I got to New York City when I was 18, I started playing in clubs in Brooklyn - I have good friends and devoted fans on the underground scene, but we were playing for each other at that point - and that was it.
- I've been writing since I was really young, so I considered myself a writer for a really long time.
- There's backlash about everything I do.
- If you consider the definition of authenticity, it's saying something and actually doing it. I write my own songs. I made my own videos. I pick my producers. Nothing goes out without my permission. It's all authentic.
- When I put out 'Video Games' in May 2011, it was a 5:25-minute love song; I was surprised when a lot of people said they were listening to it. I was surprised when it went to the radio, without me even knowing how something like that even happens!
- When I got to New York City when I was 18, I started playing in clubs in Brooklyn - I have good friends and devoted fans on the underground scene, but we were playing for each other at that point - and that was it.
- I used to wonder if it was God's plan that I should be alone for so much of my life. But I found peace. I found happiness within people and the world.
- A lot of the reason my look is the way it is, is because it's really easy to put on a sundress every night if I have to perform - or just wear jeans every day and a flannel or something.
- I write my own songs. I made my own videos. I pick my producers. Nothing goes out without my permission. It's all authentic.

- I'm always just surprised when someone writes something about me.

- I'm not a natural performer or exhibitionist. When I was younger, I hated the focus, and it made me feel strange.
- When I found somebody who I fell in love with, it made me feel different than I felt the rest of the day. It was electrifying. That's what inspired the 'Off to the Races' melodies. That's one of the times when you're feeling electrified by someone else and they make you happy to be alive.
- When I was very young I was sort of floored by the fact that my mother and my father and everyone I knew was going to die one day, and myself too. I had a sort of a philosophical crisis. I couldn't believe that we were mortal.

- I don't believe in the school of hard knocks, although I've had them. All that stuff about whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger is so not true. Do you know what makes you stronger? When people treat you and your art with dignity.
- My music is a luxury.
- If you are born an artist, you have no choice but to fight to stay an artist.

- I have a personal ambition to live my life honestly and honor the true love that I've had and also the people I've had around me.
