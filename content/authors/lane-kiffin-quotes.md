- I needed Nick Saban more than I needed Pete Carroll.
- When I was younger I used to read everything. 'Why is this guy saying this, why is this article saying this.' That's one of the things Coach Saban has taught me, he does not listen or read anything that's out there at all. He says 'why am I going to waste my time?'
- You never want your dad to introduce you to a girl.
- Coaching was always intriguing to me as a kid. Watching 'Monday Night Football' with my dad and hearing him talk through the game management and watching the Tom Landrys and Don Shulas on the sideline was more intriguing to me than watching Troy Aikman or Dan Marino throw the ball.
- You can be really hot one minute, the next minute be unemployed.
- I have begun to realize just how amazing God's plan can be.
- I know I rubbed people the wrong way.
- To do the impossible, you must be able to see the invisible.
- People's perception changes so fast. You win, and people say, 'Well, he had all of those sanctions at USC, and that's why he lost.' You lose, and, 'OK, he's a bad head coach, and he's just a good play-caller wherever he has been.'
- Anybody can do something one time. You have a great year because everything goes right. But can you maintain it and sustain it for a long period of time as Coach Carroll did and Coach Saban?
- People always say, 'Do you get bothered by what people say or blog or write about you?' I only do if I know them. If I know them, and I have a relationship with them and they write that, then that would surprise me a lot. Usually the people writing the negative stuff don't know me at all.
- To be able to go through what I've gone through and still be fortunate before the age of 40 to still be here to be offensive coordinator with Coach Saban at Alabama, you take some time to reflect on that.
- You don't win championships by having the cheapest budget.
- I'm not really big on humiliating assistant coaches in front of everybody.
- I don't think you've done something by getting a job. I think you've done something by proving you can succeed at that job.
- I know I get a lot of grief about some of the things I've said about Coach Saban, but working under him was like going back to school and getting another degree.
- Every season is a season of its own.
- Winning is fun.
- Other kids were watching John Elway. I was watching Tom Landry.
- I should have been paying Coach Saban instead of them paying me because of the amount of knowledge that you learn in three years, and you view 'The Process.'
- At Tennessee, I said I can't wait to beat Florida in the Swamp and sing 'Rocky Top' all night long. The thing at Tennessee I felt was that there needed to be energy in the program immediately. Two of the last three years there, they were 5-7. Urban Meyer and Nick Saban were at all-time highs. I felt like the fan base and players needed confidence.
- Three years under Saban changed me. He's the best coach in the world at what he does.
- I just like to have fun with the fans.
- I think you're always trying to figure yourself out and mistakes that you've made.
- I guess I should say I like to do things that people say you can't do.
- I like to make people laugh.
- I always try to find better ways to do things. Whether it's a game plan, a practice, a meeting, an interview, whatever it is. I'm going to find a way to find a way to analyze it and find a better way to do it. That's my mindset. I've never been satisfied with anything. That's just my mindset. I'm always trying to find a better way to do things.
- I just like to do things that aren't supposed to be done.
- I think as you make mistakes, the No. 1 thing you've got to do is learn from them and not just make excuses for them. I've made more than anybody, probably.
- I'm always willing to look at my actions, and do them better.
- In the end what matters is, do you develop your team, do you win games and do you graduate your players.
- I think I was 24 when I went to USC with Pete Carroll. Pete believed in people and never worried about their age. I learned that from him.

- Anybody can get a job, but what do you do when you have it?
- I like helping first-year head coaches.
- I'm not driven by money anymore.
- In college I was so mad I wasn't playing. The two guys in front of me were Billy Volek and David Carr, but I just realized that was a blessing in disguise, that I was so bad and I never played, so my brain's good.
- Coach Saban and I have a great relationship, regardless of what people may think.
- I make mistakes, and sometimes in split seconds. Then seconds later I know how wrong I was.
- Toughness isn't that you've got to fight with the guy after the play or punch him because he punched you. That's not tough. That's dumb.

- If something comes on the radio or in print, I don't think there are any facts to it at all until someone shows some proof.

- If you would have told me when I was 24 years old, right before I went with Coach Carroll to USC, you're going to get to be the offensive coordinator for Pete Carroll and then offensive coordinator for Nick Saban, arguably maybe the two best coaches in all of football by the time you're 40 years old, I would have said, 'Where do I sign up?'
- This profession, I don't know why, you're supposed to be so serious and just be so proper.
- We aspire to be like Jim Harbaugh. No, seriously, he does a great job.
- Any experience you have, there are good parts of it and bad parts, and you have to learn from the bad parts and the mistakes that you've made.
- You know what I didn't realize at the time is a really good blessing, is that I was a really crappy player.
- If there's a group of articles written about me, I can usually tell the difference if someone's writing an article and they know me from someone who doesn't know me. They're usually very different.

- One game is never going to define a player.
- I'd like to think I'm always going to defend our players.
- Should we go back to huddling? Should we go back to putting all these tight ends in there and have 250 yards a game? It doesn't win anymore. So should we do it because that's what the people before us did? No.
- There's not a day goes by that I don't ask, What would Coach Saban do?
- I don't think there's a person out there who can say they haven't done something they regret.
- My phone was not ringing very much at the time after USC, and that was a very humbling experience after being let go there and to go through that process. You start calling a lot of people that don't call you back all of a sudden, and you realize things about people.

- You can't troll somebody who doesn't see it.
- You want a job where the pressure is on and expectations are high.
- As far as the bowl games, I don't think the players really play for that. Not at USC.
- If I'm cussing at you, swearing at you, calling you demeaning names, are you really thinking about that last play? Am I really helping you get better? Or am I just making myself feel good by demeaning you? I've really never understood it.
- Any time that you get big titles or head jobs at a young age, there's going to be that factor. 'He didn't pay his dues.'
- I don't care about what people think about me that don't know me. But the one thing that bothers me of all the places is the general perception was that I was a failure at USC as a head coach.
