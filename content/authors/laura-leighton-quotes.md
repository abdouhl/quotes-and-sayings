- I try to mix it up! I do a little Pilates. I do a little Cardio Barre; sometimes I run or do the stairs.

- I think 'Pretty Little Liars' is going to be hugely popular for adults, for kids, for girls, for guys, you know, something for everyone to look at, and the stories are going to be great. There's suspense every week. The friendship is really fun to watch. I think it's going to have something for everybody.
- I think it's really important to remember that it's a long life, and it's a long career. In a perfect world, your career will be long. It does not begin and end with any one job. The point is to continue to have longevity in your career.
- I do think that 'Pretty Little Liars' has raised the bar in how social media can tie into the fan base watching the show.
- The kids can see that there are more parts to me than just being their mom; I wear a couple of different hats and have other roles to play.
- I plan on working out for the first part of the day, because if I let my day get away from me, the workout is out the window!
