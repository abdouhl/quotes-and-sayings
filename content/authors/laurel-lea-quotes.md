- Humor has always been important to me. If there is a shield of faith that you can keep up against difficulties, humor is the Teflon coating.
- It was my dream that I had clenched in a fist of discontent and wouldn't release. But time had now pried every finger open. There is peace in an open and upraised hand that isn't grasping for anything.
