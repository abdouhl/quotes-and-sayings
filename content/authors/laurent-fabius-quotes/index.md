- France on its own cannot impose its point of view. But neither should it give up on its demands. With a clear vote for change France will be in a strong position.

- At the same time the Constitution sets in stone the Stability Pact and risks preventing member States from implementing a policy of growth. So we are not able to do things at the European or the national level.
