- I went to Harvard College, grew up in Boston, and went to high school in Boston.
- Desegregation came very painfully to the Boston schools, long after John Kelly finished high school, and the pain of desegregating Boston schools was visited entirely on the students who looked like Frederica Wilson.
- The thing about live TV is that it simply has to be done, there's no space for procrastination.
- There are people who hate me, there are people who like me, and they're both right. I think people hate me for the right reasons, which is my politics and what they discern to be my personal attitudes.
- The 'West Wing' writers room would not have come up with the idea of running a presidential campaign in which an African-American gets elected. Because the realism view would have said that's not possible.
- No one outside of the Black Caucus would be happy to see Alcee Hastings in a chairmanship. I first saw Alcee Hastings in his impeachment trial in the Senate.
- What MSNBC is, what cable news prime time has become in the shows that get the ratings, is the oped page of the newspaper.
- Shepard Smith has frequently been the lone voice of reason on Fox News.
- Big city mayors don't play well with voters outside their city anymore. Just ask John Lindsay, Ed Koch, Kevin White, Tom Bradley, Dick Riordon. Rudy Giuliani is no exception.
- To expose a first draft to anyone's ears other than your own is indecent.
- Republicans believe that tax cuts can build buildings, all sorts of miraculous things. A lot of Democrats and liberals believe that spending more money in a school is going to up the test scores, no matter how much evidence there is that it won't, or hasn't.
- Practically, every defense lawyer knows that the jury desperately wants to hear from the defendant and that the only reason not to put him on the stand is that he is soooo guilty that every answer he gives after his name will eradicate any shred of reasonable doubt.
- In pre-election polling, momentum is more important than position, and in primary polling, national numbers are useless.
- I ended up going to Harvard College, which was about as likely in my neighborhood as going to the moon.
- I'm one of those actors who finds the part in the wardrobe.
- The worst teacher in America could never do as much damage as the worst police officer in America. But the right wing has never even been slightly curious about evaluating the job performance of police officers.
- What we're doing on 'The West Wing' is fictional. It's not a place to learn about politics or government. Has there ever been a fundraiser on 'The West Wing?' No. So right there, you're in Disneyland.
- I've never done anything that I need to be doing tomorrow. If someone says, 'We no longer want you here,' I won't show up again. It was true at 'The West Wing.' It was true in the Senate.
- The First Amendment protects the news media and the news media knows how to use it. Donald Trump doesn't understand it, he's never going to understand it.
- I think what has worked very well is Rachel Maddow just being Rachel. I don't think there's anyone who could give Rachel advice about anything.
- Bill O'Reilly is a socialist. He is in favor of Medicare, he is in favor of Social Security. Those are socialist programs.
- The George Wallace campaign in 1968 was the model for the Trump campaign in 2016.
- Political talk on TV has degenerated so much. You can say something complex on 'The West Wing' and you will not suffer a screaming interruption by three other panelists.
- I discovered, to my surprise, that writing for live television made me a faster writer.
- It's hard to get me outraged.
- People like Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have been very busy educating America about just how much socialism we have, from Social Security to Medicare to public schools to public universities, and how much we love that. The truth is that there is no pure socialist or capitalist economy on earth.
- I never like the TV or movie Harvard characters. The fact of the matter is that most people who go to Harvard went to public schools and weren't in final clubs. I didn't even know that final clubs existed until I was a senior.
- Successful presidential campaigns follow a two-part strategy. For Republicans, Richard Nixon described it as running to the right in the primaries and running back to the center in the general election. For Democrats, the idea is to go to the left in the primaries, then to the center.
- All men in makeup are playing a part.
- I don't for one second spend any time thinking about carefully ingratiating myself with someone for the future.
- Nothing outrages and disappoints an extremist more than compromise.
- I've often wondered what it would have been like if we'd had cable news during the Vietnam War and Watergate.
- I spent a few years after college as a Boston public school teacher and I loved it. But I was never committed to it, committed to it as a career.
- There are people out there who disagree with me politically, and understand the limits of that disagreement. It doesn't mean we disagree as people on basic human needs.
- Never once has Republican world said hey, maybe we should look into how police officers are carrying out their solemn public responsibility to serve and protect. No - no right wing website in America is investigating or will ever investigate how well police officers do their jobs.
- Many chiefs of staff are close, very close, to their bosses on Capitol Hill.
- I don't trust news sources, and neither should other people. They should use them in the same way that they use medical opinions and get more than one on the important issues. Trust is the most precious thing you could possibly give to another person. But to institutions? Publications?
- I'm a very slow writer.
- Prosecutors have absolutely no control over what witnesses say when they leave the grand jury room.
- There are plenty of odd couple Congressmen who have roomed together on Capitol Hill, but I have never heard of a chief of staff who rooms with his boss. It is beyond unusual.
- If I write a cop show, it's not up to me to decide how different it is from 'Law & Order.' I had screenwriters go on and on and on about how their cop show isn't like any other cop show on TV. They made very good points, and it absolutely doesn't matter. It's entirely up to the audience to decide.
- At 'The West Wing,' I cast newscasters, and when you put out a casting call for actors, half of the people who come in are real local L.A. newscasters. Each time, I ended up hiring one of them, because they're better at it. Big surprise! A newscaster is better at playing a newscaster than an actor is.
- Nixon's adroit use of television in 1952 was well ahead of its time.
- Henry Kissinger spent years negotiating the terms of our surrender there and ended up with a deal that he could have gotten on the first day he went to work in the Nixon White House - the Americans leave and North Vietnam wins.
- Roger Ailes's effect on politics was much longer-lasting than Richard Nixon's, even though Nixon was elected president twice.
- Charlie Rangel is angry about the Iraq war, the one that Henry Kissinger has told us we can't win. Thanks, Henry, but most Americans figured that out before you did. Rangel saw combat in Korea. Kissinger has only seen combat on TV. That might have something to do with why Kissinger thinks our troops should stay in Iraq even though we can't win.
- I can be as crazy as anybody and go over lines I should not go over.
- Publicly, defense lawyers cling to the text book theory that the defendant has no burden of proof and that no negative inference should ever be taken when a defendant doesn't defend himself on the witness stand.
- Around the courthouse when defense lawyers are chatting about their cases, the only question they ask each other is can you put your guy on the stand? Those conversations always assume the defendant is guilty. The question is just about the degree of difficulty in presenting a defense.
- I don't think Republicans are evil. I think they mostly have a different philosophy of government than I do.
- One of the things that I see on Twitter is that people think they know what you think about things you haven't discussed.
- Politics has become show biz.
- Anything anyone wants to say about me is fair. There's not a single thing that any viewer has ever said about anything I do on television that has bothered me in the least. And every single person has the right to hate whoever they want to hate on television, whether it be singers, actors, pundits. That's the deal.
- I think a lot of people on both sides have extremely naive views of what government is capable of.

- Where I come from, no one settled their disagreements with bets, because no one of us had any money to bet.
- If a website has something I should know, somebody is spinning it around Twitter and I'll see it there. Before I would look at Huffington Post and Slate every day, now I follow them on Twitter.
- I majored in economics in college. Certain things were just out, like chemistry or biology, or science or math, that was just out of the question. That's just an aptitude impossibility, I couldn't have done it.
- I grew up a few years after John Kelly in an identical neighborhood in the other side of Boston and I went to high school in John Kelly's neighborhood. I know the neighborhood John Kelly comes from, I know the culture.
- Being American means you never have to say you surrender.
- There's something about the power of influential correspondents tweeting something that has become the fastest way to get a story moving. It will turn into something much faster and much bigger than it would have.
- The Republican base - the Evangelical get-out-the-vote troops - are going to be devastated when they discover how many closeted gay Republicans were involved in policing Mark Foley in the House of Representatives.
- Staten Island is set off completely by itself in its own world, and that's one of the fascinating things about it, dramatically.
- I have no idea what I would be, I really don't have the vaguest idea what I would be, if my father had remained a Boston cop. I don't have any idea what I would have thought the horizon was.
- I have no broadcasting training. No one's ever said to me, 'This is how you read a Teleprompter.' They just pointed to it and said, 'It's over there.'
- Practical European socialists have embraced the idea that the government has a role in healthcare and in supporting strong transportation systems that do not depend entirely on individual motor vehicles. And it turns out we're all socialists now, and there are very few Americans who understand that.
- Every single television product has the ambition to chase ratings, every one of them. Many have other ambitions, for many, ratings are not #1. But my experience on TV, and on the entertainment side, has been entirely ratings-based. When I look at TV I look at ratings. And I never second guess ratings. Never.
- Everything I ever suggested for 'The West Wing' comes from my work with Senator Moynihan.
- The Iraq Study Group's report is a very respectable cover document for American surrender in Iraq.
- The great thing about going to Malawi is I have no contact for at least a week with anything that's happening back in Washington.
- In the summer of 2007, I was in New York for some meetings and... I rented a car and just drove to Staten Island to take a glance and remind myself about it. I ended up staying a couple of days there in a hotel and I've been all over the island several times since.
- Lawyers know that certain witnesses are simply not going to be cooperative and are not going to answer the questions. And what matters at that point is what is your question? Because everything you want the jury to know should be in your question, or everything you want the jury to wonder about should be in your question.
- You can be outraged by what the Koch brothers do with their money in politics and you can appreciate what they contribute to hospitals and medical research, and you can do that at the same time and still retain an ability to function.
- Liberals amuse me. I am a socialist.
- I tend not to look at Twitter in the morning; I try to force myself not to, for time management. I'll look at it on the way to work.
- All writers are forced to live within deadlines, and deadlines determine how good they can be.
- I've never understood the value of putting someone on television to lie, knowing that they're going to lie ahead of time, knowing that that is their deal: to lie ahead of time. There is zero news value in that.
- If in the script there is an argument about gun control, the most precious document you could produce at 'The West Wing' that week is a passionate, intelligent case against gun control. We know how to do the other one.
- I've lived a life of unplanned freelance employment.
- I always knew I'd be leaving government someday. I just didn't know when. There was something about knowing that it was temporary that left me in writerly observational mode.
- If you have five weeks to write an episode of television or seven months to write a movie or several years to write a book, each of those things is going to be better than a live television show.
- There was the slow discovery for me in the early '80s that Republicans are people too... That Republicans are perfectly reasonable people... and that Republicans can be right about something.
- America never formally surrenders, so we have to call surrender something else. In Vietnam, we called it Vietnamization.
- Advocating war is easier when you and your family are not endangered by it.
- Show business comes with wonderfully long vacations, like the life of a college professor.
- When you get off to an African country like Malawi - which is pretty removed from everything and pretty seriously off the grid - and you see the struggle of life that goes on there, it's a completely different thing than what happens here.
- I am not a liberal who is so afraid of the word that I had to change my name to progressive.
- Every cable news channel was a very big business success before Donald Trump started lying about Barack Obama's birth certificate. And they were all making more money than they knew what to do with then and more money than Donald Trump has ever seen in his life.
- The West Wing' is an extremely naive entry into politics and political thinking.
- I do strive to be the Andy Kaufman of TV news.

- There's times where you can watch television and say, 'Look at that cheesy thing they're doing for ratings,' and you're right.

- If a reader comes across a story that makes them cry, you can be sure that the writer felt every single thing that makes the reader cry.
- The United States is and will continue to be the most important country in the world, economically, militarily, intellectually. There's nothing that four years of Trump can do to stop that. What it is no longer, during the Trump years, is the leading source for better governmental arrangements between countries.
- I love some of the most hateful tweets. I think they're very funny. In the negative attacks on me, there are frequently some real displays of humor. I want to reply, but I won't, because there are all sorts of other people making serious points that I care about, and I don't want them to be discouraged.
- The Trump view of immigration defies our history. Immigration is a transaction that has historically benefited the country.
