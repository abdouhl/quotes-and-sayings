- Climate change is the biggest issue facing our planet. Extreme weather hit every populated continent in 2018, killing, injuring and displacing millions.
- It is not at all antisemitic to describe a state as racist.
- We need a completely different type of economy - one which is truly green, sustainable, and embeds the biggest issues of the day into its heart.
- Liberal Democrats have been leading the fight for a People's Vote and we're getting closer to that with each day.
- The future of British politics is not the pale, male and stale stereotype of tradition. Things are changing for the better.
- Studying abroad should not be something that only the wealthy can afford. Every student deserves the opportunity to experience other cultures, make new friendships, share ideas and widen their horizons.
- Lib Dems are really good at making very detailed policies but very bad are communicating the core values that drive those policies. I'd like us to say less but more often. We need to focus on a few themes and go hard on them.
- Hospitals don't have enough beds, staff shortages are being exacerbated by the uncertainty surrounding what Brexit means for EU nationals and our ability to access new cancer treatments is under threat.
- My mum is Palestinian and my dad is British but worked all his life from the European Union for their Foreign Action Service. So I was born in Hammersmith but moved away when I was one. That's when dad joined the European Commission.
- At the age of one, I was already heavier than most: doctors told my mum that she should start feeding me differently to the advice given by the health visitor. Yet I ate healthily, nothing was processed, and I was active and happy. But for whatever reason, I was on the bigger side.
- By allowing many adult learners to retrain and upskill throughout their careers, colleges provide expertise for key sectors.
- For all the farcical invoking of Blitz spirit, Brexit isn't merely an absurdist experiment in English nationalist nostalgia - it is the most audacious example yet of a futuristic Russian nationalism that seeks to divide and rule Europe.
- The electorate is bored of talking about the past. They are much more interested in the future.
- At school I hated swimming and felt bigger and more self-conscious than all the other girls - and I would go to summer sports camps to desperately try to change my shape so that it couldn't be one of the taunts aimed at me by bullies.
- Outside the EU, studying abroad will become the reserve of the wealthy. Inside the EU, it's an opportunity available to almost everyone.
- I believe that Theresa May is going to end up with a botched Brexit that will satisfy no one and make sure that calls for a people's vote on the final Brexit deal will only get louder.
- Our tired, old politics is tearing at the seams. The Lib Dems have returned to their local roots, just as a more pluralist politics is desperately needed.
- It is vital that MPs take the issue of climate change seriously and support the students in their activism. They can rest assured that I certainly do.
- Finding your feet in a new country provides an enormous boost to your confidence and independence.
- Politicians need to realise that words have consequences.
- A united, functional opposition really could stop Brexit.
- Sure, sexism is not confined to the Conservatives. Harriet Harman has suggested that Gordon Brown didn't make her deputy prime minister because she was a woman.
- When you've got society calling you a burden and talking about how much money you're costing the state, it's bound to impact negatively on your mental health.
- The one thing that robots really find difficult to do is to look someone in the eye and have a sense of how they're feeling. We should be teaching that in schools.
- Climate change poses a serious threat to global prosperity, security and wellbeing.
- As a former teacher, I know how frustrating it must be to watch students walk out of class, particularly if they have important exams on the horizon.
- I am naturally centre-left so the areas of education there are things on which I could work quite closely with Labour on... For example, on trying in Parliament to abolish SATs, I would be the first one through the gates.
- Food banks have told us of the increasing donations of, and demand for, tampons and pads which are gratefully received by women struggling to afford them.
- The war against sexism is portrayed increasingly a battle long ago won. To which my response is, 'if only'.
- I am a British-Palestinian who believes in Israel's right to exist.
- I have been inspired by the way that Ken Clarke has navigated parliament. I am actively looking across the House for people I really respect and warm to and can learn things from.
- Having stared into the abyss of what it actually means for your life to be the leader of a political party, I'm just full of admiration and respect for anyone who wants to do it.
- Losing weight, even with the help of the operation I had, remains the hardest thing I have ever done - and the thing I am most proud of.
- Palestinians also have a right not to have their homes demolished because an occupying power refuses to grant them a permit. Palestinian children should not be shot at or arrested in the middle of the night and interrogated by the Israeli military while terrified and isolated.
- Brexit is the most complex and difficult political decision our country has had to take in mine and many other lifetimes.
- I miss the classroom and the bit I miss the most is the one-on-one personal interactions with the students, those moments when they surprise you with their insightfulness, or their cheekiness.
- Liberal Democrat councillors have a well-deserved reputation for being fantastic community representatives, and these results are testament to the incredibly hard work of our existing councillors and our campaigners.
- My subjects were maths and physics. I truly appreciate the value in sciences, but understand the difficulty finding and retaining teachers for these subjects, especially when most of my Imperial cohort ended up as management consultants or in finance.
- What provides me with the strength and conviction to walk proudly among protesters so angry about the policies I endorse is the support I absorb when I am in my own constituency. Whenever I am at home, I am met with smiling faces, and words of thanks, even hugs.
- We want to encourage a move away from polluting vehicles, aiming to ban new diesel and petrol cars by 2030, and expand electric vehicle charging infrastructure.
- Apprenticeships, when they are delivered well, have the potential to offer massive benefits to our employers and our economy as a whole by upskilling our workforce, and offer a vital alternative to those who feel that a more academic route is not the right one for them.
- The more I hear about Eddie Izzard's political agenda, the more sympathetic I feel. I cheer him on in his cause, but I fear he faces an uphill battle.
- We need a government that takes climate change seriously, one that doesn't shunt it to the side-lines.
- Brexit stops Britain from being Great Britain.
- Brexit has certainly exposed an ugly underbelly of our democracy. It is clear to me that we must ensure that the many Leave voting communities must never be left behind again.
- And in addition to overhauling exams, I'd also like to see every school in England with a fully qualified counsellor on the staff, whose responsibility it is to work with the pupils and staff who suffer from mental health and wellbeing issues.
- The primary aim of our schools should be to help children grow into happy, healthy and confident adults, equipped with the skills to achieve their goals in life and work.
- For far too many, the housing crisis has become a human crisis, with people being criminalised who should instead be protected as our most vulnerable citizens.
- I think we need to make access to mental health services a priority in the obesity strategy, too.
- Calling out antisemitism doesn't make me any less Palestinian.
- MPs put ourselves at the behest of the British people, certainly, but we are not infallible or devoid of sensitivity.
- There are lots of great educationalists out there who really care about social mobility.
- I became an MP in 2017 and have been around to watch Liberal Democrat party membership soar.
- Genuine supporters of Palestinians' rights are fighting for equality, justice and freedom, aims that are in diametric opposition to any form of antisemitism.
- To me it is just common sense that we should be making apprenticeships readily available to every young person who wants to go down that route - and encouraging people to consider taking this path just as readily as we would encourage someone to look into a university degree.
- The word 'Zionist' has become toxic. To some it means believing in Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state. To others it represents a movement that led to the expulsion and marginalisation of the Palestinian people in their own land.
- From a young age, pupils are put under immense amounts of pressure in high-stakes exams. Often, they're made to feel like their whole future depends on how they perform in these narrowly focussed tests.
- I like the idea of a Citizen's Assembly that has been used in Ireland, providing a forum in which to discuss the nuances of an issue before deciding if and how it should be put to the people.
- Any one of us could fall on hard times. Work and housing have the potential to be unstable, especially for those earning low wages or relying on family and friends. It should not be a criminal offence to sleep on the street.
- And there were the health benefits of being slimmer. My size made me more likely to get type 2 diabetes and perhaps even cancer, and could have affected my fertility.
- One of my earliest memories is Mum telling me not to have as many sweets as the other kids because I put on weight so easily.
- The creative industries, a source of optimism in recent years owing to, among other things, a resurgence on the world stage of British music, have come out foursquare against Brexit.
- I was really super into science an not at all in to politics. I think it was a reaction against the fact my dad was a diplomat. I wanted to do something that was totally different. I fell in love with science.
- The benefits of studying abroad are huge. You can pick up a new language, develop a love for another culture, and pick up new skills, hobbies and work experience to boost your CV.
- Michael Gove was one of the worst things to ever happen to the education system in this country. David Cameron is the worst Prime Minister this country has ever had.
- The Conservative government's neglect of social housing is all too apparent and should be a source of national shame.
- When I finished my degree I became a physics and maths teacher. And worked in the international school in Brussels, because like many kids, after University I went home going 'ahhh I don't know what to do'. I happened to fall upon a job there because they were desperate for a physics teacher which is a common theme among many schools.
- As a former teacher, it pains me to watch such an essential and rewarding profession suffer due to government neglect.
- Of course, the damaging pressure of competition and high-stakes testing isn't limited to the impact on children themselves. It filters down to pupils because of the pressure on school leadership and teachers in turn, to perform well in Ofsted inspections and league tables.
- More and more people - Leavers and Remainers - from every region, every political party and every walk of life, are demanding a vote on the final Brexit deal before we leave the EU.
- Luckily for me, my views align with those of my constituents and party; the Liberal Democrats are unabashedly pro-European and are unapologetically up-front about our pursuit of a democratic way to stay in the EU.
- I believe that Brexit, whether it's a bad deal or no deal, is a big deal - too big for anyone to ignore - but it's not a done deal.
- I've been a fan of Eddie Izzard since school.
- I joined a gym when I was 11, agreed to seeing a dietitian aged 15, and I remember being a teenager and going to shops, only to find that as a size 16, the clothes were hidden at the back or on different floors well away from the shop windows.
- A no deal Brexit could bring Britain to a grinding halt and threaten the wellbeing of our country.
- Protesting is a fundamental aspect of our democracy, and I will always encourage this course of action, but it can be intimidating.
- By refusing to give 16- and 17-year olds the vote, the Conservative Government are risking worsening voter apathy and being on the wrong side of history.
- Certainly anyone who complains of sexism is marked down as humourless.
- We boast of being one of the oldest democracies in existence and it is a point of pride for many of us that British society represents a beacon of hope for repressed peoples living in authoritarian states around the world.
- I will always believe that my vote, and the votes of my Lib Dem colleagues, are the best thing I can do to save this country from a no-deal Brexit and save it from Boris Johnson.
- The actual teaching itself becomes lost in a sea of paperwork and teachers soon realise that the very reason they entered this profession constitutes only a fraction of their working day.
- The important point is Brexiteers said that this would be easy, that we could leave and enter a post-Brexit nirvana, a land of milk and honey that will satisfy their ideological dogma and make the people happy. Sadly, this deluded dream has run out of steam.
- There is no single cause of homelessness, and vulnerable people, those with mental health problems and addictions for example, need support not punishment.
- In my head, I'm still a teacher. I miss the kids.
