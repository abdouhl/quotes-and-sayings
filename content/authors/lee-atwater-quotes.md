- I think I learned pretty early that in the end, it's only you. To an extent, you're all alone.
- My childhood, adolescence and high school days are unusually important. If there has ever been a time that I developed a uniqueness and sense of humor and the ability to organize, it was then. In those early days, I developed the skills that gave me a certain degree of success in American politics.

- I don't know who will lead us through the '90s, but they must be made to speak to this spiritual vacuum at the heart of American society, this tumor of the soul.
- Mostly I am sorry for the way I thought of other people. Like a good general, I had treated everyone who wasn't with me as against me.
- Perception is reality.
- Most of the time I was in grammar school through high school, I was in some kind of rock n' roll band. I would say that at least 80 percent of my energy was involved with whatever band I was involved in.
