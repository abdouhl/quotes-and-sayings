- Film shoots generally don't smell good.
- I like the idea of all of us looking at the world with less of an emphasis on national borders and with more of an emphasis on shared humanity.
- I just want to say that 'Minari' is about a family. It's a family trying to learn how to speak a language of its own. It goes deeper than any American language and any foreign language.
- I just feel like the garden is a place where you can explore humanity quite deeply.
- I was hitting 40, and I realized I needed to just move on in life and do something practical.
- Because growing up as an Asian-American and growing up as someone who is not white, oftentimes in this country you can feel as though you're a foreigner, or you're reminded of being a foreigner, even though you're not. Even though inside, internally, you feel completely American.
- My daughter was five when I was writing 'Minari,' very much close to the age of David. And I was about to turn 40, which was the age my dad was when he decided he was going to start this farm in Arkansas.
- Among Korean immigrants the majority tends to be Christian, because that was the way they immigrated to America - through the support network of churches. I grew up with faith being an important fabric of my life. That comes with my life in the South - it was just a given that you believe.
- When I look back now, as an adult, I'm able to see my mom and grandmother in a different way that I didn't understand as a kid.
- There's something about just connecting with people in their specific place and also finding that they're human just like me.

- For a struggling filmmaker running low on ideas, public domain is all we have for adapting books.
- I think one of the things that I had to establish for myself quite early on was the rule that this is not my parents and this is not me or my family, that somehow this has to become a family that exists solely in the film of 'Minari.'
- Any time there is a film in a 'foreign language,' in Spanish or Korean or whatever language, it's usually not an American film. It's usually from another country.
- For many years, I was trying to catch up and fit in a little bit more with that New York artsy intellectual space.

- After having struggled through some close friends' and family members' battles with cancer, I wanted to create an American drama about the experience of tragedy and memory.
- There are a lot of Korean films that will show marital strife, but I'm not sure I've seen so many that will show it in the interest of showing a real marriage - one that ultimately succeeds.
- My father came to America believing in the romantic dream of what he saw in films like 'Big Country' and 'Giant' - this fertile land able to yield so much promise.
- But I kind of reframed my thinking, where I don't feel like filmmaking is what defines me anymore. Like, I feel like I'm much more defined by my family and other things in life that, that I feel are much deeper to me.
- These days I love watching Billy Wilder. I'm not saying the arthouse stuff is self-serious, but I needed to get out of my head a little bit and not treat films so seriously.
- I always loved Flannery O'Conner, and how she's not trying to create sympathetic characters.
- I always tend to gravitate toward the idea of things being human: that this isolation I feel as an Asian American, even though it's real, other people have it too in their own way.
- I know, it's disturbing that gentle looking people have such violence, but I believe we all have a penchant for violence in us.
- I was a little bit anti-industry, anti-Hollywood.
- There was never a point where I thought, 'I'm going to do something Asian American.'
- When I was thinking of giving up, I was very dissatisfied with the idea that the films that I've made are the ones my daughter might see in the future and would represent what was very personal to me.
- The single most eye-opening experience for me and what propelled me to become a filmmaker was that I started to see films from other countries.
- A lot of people have had good discussions about what it means to be American, and we need to broaden our definition.
- I don't diminish the idea of being American, but what I embrace is the idea of being human.
- As a kid... there's a veil of separation between you and your dad, especially when you have a dad who's under a lot of stress.
- She died when I was 16 and I just think no history books, nothing is ever going to talk about my grandmother. She was kind of invisible. She couldn't speak English so didn't have many friends. I think of her any time I think of the word 'sacrifice.'
- I had my daughter in 2013, we moved to L.A. and there's just lots of things that were happening that were feeding into the desire to tell a story that's more personal and to talk about what it's like to be a father.
- I didn't set out to win an Oscar, of course, but to be in this conversation, it's somehow an honour and a strange life experience as well.
- What I noticed is that the lens from which people want to look at 'Minari' is just from that Asian-American angle. And I think that can end up being very frustrating. Because the craft of the film, and this film itself, is meant to embody a lot of different things.
- I had to stop taking myself and the craft that seriously. Somehow I saw the bigger context of life. It's just a movie. What I wanted was to entertain and delight and put the audience on a nice ride.
- I know a lot of people in my old town in Arkansas are big Trump supporters, and in a way I try to understand them. I try not to judge them for that.

- I do care what my daughter thinks and what the future generation of whoever is down the line will think.
- I felt like I was growing up with two different churches, in a sense. And that's always stayed with me - not just the religion of it - but the day-to-day understanding that these beliefs, that faith itself, is something that I need as something to sustain me.
- Many filmmakers start off with an autobiographical film from childhood, and that's kind of what I was thinking I would do, but other projects would just present themselves naturally in the beginning.
- I think the vast majority of us in this country hunger for more unity and hospitality, and we all share and shoulder the burden of hard work to build that.
- There's a lot of regret that I have about not showing my proper gratitude to my grandmother.
- My sister and I thought my grandmother was not very grandmotherly compared to all of the church ladies that we knew. She was making sure we learned all the Korean swear words, just in case we needed them. Now I see what an awesome lady she was.
- A lot of times we have these categories that maybe don't fit the reality of human experience and human identity. I'm completely sympathetic to what a lot of people in my community are saying - that often as Asian Americans we're made to feel more foreign than we internally feel ourselves.
- I had some early success with my first film and since then it's been a grind. It's clearly a craft that I love, and a craft that I work on constantly, but after so many years, I didn't feel like I had much to show for that.
- There's a constant level of risk in farming that so few movies let you feel. I wanted to show some of that, but also, by contrast, reflect on how nature so often offers grace.
- My parents, they grew up in a time when there was war in Korea. And my grandmother, her husband, my grandfather, was a soldier and he died in the war. A lot of people in that generation, they didn't go to schools. My grandmother couldn't read; she didn't finish beyond elementary school.
- I wonder what things will be like for my daughter; she seems so comfortable growing up with an international identity.
- I filmed my first narrative feature in 2006, a story set in Rwanda called 'Munyurangabo.'
- I went to Rwanda with my wife who had been going for the past three summers. She is an art therapist who works with survivors of the genocide. I decided to become a volunteer also, and to teach filmmaking. But thinking about how to approach a class, it made sense to start making a movie there, with the kids.
- I was so excited when 'Parasite' won the Oscar last year, and part of that was the shared Korean heritage and also it was just knowing that Bong Joon Ho made an incredible film and it didn't matter what language they were speaking, what country it was from, audiences all around the world responded to it.
- My dad started to watch westerns at dollar cinemas in Seoul and felt like America was a miraculous place. His family had lost a lot of land during the Korean War and the Japanese occupation. That affected him a lot as a kid. He always felt like he needed to come to the U.S. and get land.
- I modeled my work after contemporary masters of art house cinema but felt my voice was missing.
- My grandmother, if she were still alive, she'd be very proud that I held through and did a film in Korean and didn't compromise and then start using that foreign language of English.
- After everything my parents were teaching us about Korean culture, about being respectful and all these things, you know, here came my grandmother, who is very crass and wanted to teach us how to gamble.
- I was on this weird, wild goose chase where I thought I might try to adapt a Willa Cather book. And if you don't know Willa Cather, she was an author in the early 1900s. And for a while, she wrote these books about New York high society.
- Growing up where I was, there were no Asians, no minorities, and there was always something to remind me of what I'm not. And when I go to Korea it's the same thing. I'm constantly reminded that I'm not Korean.
- I took time off and realized that what I was lacking was the discipline in trying to write a script.
- Even my parents felt like, 'My son finally made it working with Youn Yuh-jung.'
- I was just making movies to make movies. I was so full of anxiety about becoming a filmmaker that I kind of lost the idea of why I was doing it.
- My dad told me that he came to the U.S. because of watching Hollywood movies. So the American Dream for him was based on what you see in films.
- I have always loved comedies.
- I wanted to make something that transcends borders and gets beyond this feeling of national identity.
- I was used to always having a stack of Korean television VHS tapes growing up.
- It's always about agency - that's the goal, always, to give agency to people. I think that's always got to be the priority.
- It's hard to say, 'I demand a seat at a table for best picture.'
- For us, church was kind of the way that we found our first entry into community in Arkansas. My parents would drop us off at the First Baptist Church of Lincoln so that we would make friends and we would learn English.
- Most of my friends were white. I grew up really the only minority in my school, along with my sister.
- Ingrid Bergman in 'Journey to Italy' just goes off and looks at things for most of the film.
- As an exercise, I devoted an afternoon to writing my memories of childhood. I remembered our family's arrival at a single-wide trailer on an Ozark meadow and my mother's shock at learning that this would be our new home.
- Growing up, the question of faith and the question of God, specifically with Christianity, has been something that's informed me quite a lot, but it's also very loaded. The way that it's often expressed in America is very different from the way that I view things.
- I just hope that in some ways, 'Minari' can pave the way for other filmmakers, other actors, other projects that maybe don't fit within traditional boxes - if it helps those films get made in the future, I'd be so thrilled.
- I grew up feeling like the main obstacles that we were trying to overcome had more to do with how we survive together as a family, and less to do with external relationships that we had with the community.
- I didn't grow up breathing cinema. I had to figure it all out in public.
- Part of the fabric of America is that we have people from different countries who've come here and they are American, and yet they embrace their home ancestral culture. And this is their new home. And that's part of what makes this country unique in the history of human beings on this earth.
- I want people to know that I am not an overnight success, if only to encourage the people who don't feel that they are being successful.
- But for me, at one point I was like, 'Why do I want to make films that people want to walk out of?' What if I actually want people to engage and have a good time?
- I grew up watching films of predominantly white families speaking in English, and that this represented the American experience.
- If you're in the rural South, you don't get Korean TV, unless you can find a Korean grocery guy who has been taping Korean programs and then offering them.
- We grew up in rural Arkansas without any Koreans close by, and when I go to Korea feel out of place.
- I began my filmmaking career by shooting a feature length documentary in China in 2004, the year I graduated from film school.
- I just feel so damn proud for the entire family behind 'Minari.'
- I think we just have to be mindful of what that definition of an American dream is. I think we are faced with a lot of definitions of that that are, frankly, unhealthy.
- I remember hearing my mom saying so many times we should never have left Korea. She would see the way that I was growing up and the fact that I was speaking English and not speaking Korean as well, and she would fear the things that we were forgetting.
- 'Minari' was only eligible for the best foreign language film category due to the HFPA rules on language, so the film was submitted to meet these rules; there was no choice involved in the matter.
- I've never felt completely American.
- Having parents who are chicken sexers - I had trouble explaining that to kids at school!

- I thought about quitting filmmaking, just because it was becoming so difficult for me.
- I didn't have much of a taste for Korean food growing up: I was over the moon about Mexican food.
- I remember my roommate was watching 'Seven Samurai,' and I just couldn't fathom why anybody would watch it.
- Early on... I did notice that a lot of people had the tendency to do their own story starting out. I felt like I was never interested in that, and I wanted to tell stories of people who are very different.
- Insecurities and missteps can plague writers and artists who come from rural places. We worry that our provincial life experiences won't gain the approval of urban curators, so we assimilate ourselves to other, more sophisticated voices.
