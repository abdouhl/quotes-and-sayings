- We all learn from each other, and I never really hung out with guys in that way, so I missed out.

- I'd like to feel that whatever I play is a result of whatever I've heard.

- It's very demanding to make up your own music.
- I understood that if I wanted to work, the saxophone was the main instrument. The clarinet was what we call a double.
