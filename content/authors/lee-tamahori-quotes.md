- Sex should not be in the movies and should be in the home, and violence should be in the movies and not in the home.
- I've always loved the Bond pictures. I have watched every single one. Movies don't get bigger or better than Bond, so I knew this was my opportunity to do a massive action picture with outrageous stunts.
- Always be original. Never duplicate what you've seen another actor do. Be true to the character that you've been given, and the rest will come easy.
- A Bond movie falls into a specific genre, and you have to provide certain elements. You must respect the fact it's essentially about girls, guns, gadgets, and big action.
