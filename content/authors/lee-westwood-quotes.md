- Golf is difficult to get your personality over because you are such a bottle of concentration.

- I'm a golfer - not an athlete.
- Yes, a Major would mean so much to me but I'm a great believer that if you work hard and in the right way, you will get what you deserve.
- I'm 37, I'm pretty fit and feel I have another eight years left - which means there's 32 Majors still to go at.
- I'm working my way steadily back and I'm feeling good.
- Listen, everything I did in my childhood was competitive. Everything we did my dad made it into a game to win. We used to drive my mum nuts.
- Race horses are like golfers, you're never sure how they're going to come out of the stalls. It's just - hopefully the horses come out of the race all right, just fit and ready to go again in the near future, but 3rd was good. It's paid for its hay.
- Sometimes Americans don't quite get my sense of humor. My good ol' British sarcasm seems to go over their heads.
- Yeah, two or three weeks ago I was fairly snappy. I've never been injured before and this year it feels like I've hardly played.
- I'm the best in the world.
- I ruptured my plantaris muscle. It runs through the calf and goes down the side of your achilles and stretches right to the heel.

- I've started to show the consistency in majors I had in regular tournaments back in 1998-2000 when I was contending nearly every week.

- I never take myself too seriously.
- I know I'm good enough to contend in each and every major I play.

- Golf is played between the ears and if you are not 100 percent focused on what you are trying to do, then people will go past you no matter who you are.
