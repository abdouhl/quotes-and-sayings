- During the past 23 years, I have set a number of goals for myself and I'm proud to say that these goals have been achieved.
- If I don't feel the same hunger as I once did then I definitely shouldn't box any more.
- My main goal was to win all the belts, and I have done that.
- After you win all these belts, you cannot fight all these mandatory guys.
- The fight will last as long as I allow it to last, and then I will knock him out.
- People know I was the last true champion.
- If the money's right, I'm happy to bust up the other side of his face... No problem.
- Now I am ready to set new goals and start a new career for myself outside of the ring.
- It's not rage that drives me, it's competition.
- I wanted to prove I was the best fighter in the world.
- I don't have anything else to prove.
- Whatever I do, I always want to get better.
- In boxing you create a strategy to beat each new opponent, it's just like chess.
- When you look back in history and see other fighters coming back, it's never really been good for them.
- If the media didn't know I played chess, there'd be no angle on me at all.
- So, I gave my belts out to others to give them a chance.
- I have been in there with all of them and there is nothing left for me to prove.
- When you go into the other guy's backyard you cannot hope to win on points.
- You can just fight one man at a time.
- The mission I set out on in the beginning - to become heavyweight champion of the world, undisputed, lineal champion - you could say that mission is complete.
- I've got a new life now, a new future, there's a lot more to Lennox Lewis than just being a boxer.
- I've worked hard and accomplished what I've accomplished in the heavyweight scene.
- I always ask myself why old heavyweights come back, but I plan to stay out of the ring.
- I just want to complete my legacy.
