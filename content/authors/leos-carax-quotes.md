- Every film starts with two or three images. Then I try to edit these images.
- Even a fiction film is hard to end. You can going on shooting and editing a documentary forever.
- I mostly don't submit to talking about my work because I would like another talk about real life.
- I'm not only my films, but I'm pretty much my films.
- When I made my first film, I had hardly ever seen a camera before, and I was a young man when I arrived in Paris from the suburbs. At the time, I didn't talk much. I was very shy, so the bluff served me. I was telling people that I had no money, and that I knew how to make films, but I had no proof.
- I care about cinema even though I haven't made many films.
- I don't work with people who ask me questions.
- I'm not a cineaste. I've made so few films. Sometimes it feels each one is the last one or the first one.
- I feel that cinema is my country. But it's not my business.
- My films start with images, a few images and a few feelings, and I try to edit them together to see the correspondence between these images and these feelings.

- Men talk about art, and artists make art, but should artists talk?
- I travel, I read, I write, I have other lives. But when I have a camera, I know that's my country, my island.
- Cinema is a territory. It exists outside of movies. It's a place I live in. It's a way of seeing things, of experiencing life. But making films, that's supposed to be a profession.
- There's a real cowardice in the movie business. If you don't meet the right crazy people, you can't do it.
- I don't think men were meant to be interviewed.
- I like tragedies, whether they're sci-fi or something else, but I can't say I know much about any genre in particular.
- I'm not especially interested in actors or their life, double, triple identities and all that.
- I've always been interested in invisible worlds, and I like to visit digital worlds, you know, any world that's imposed on us.
- I'm not against the virtual world; it's fascinating, but I don't like the way they try to impose it on us. It's a thing imposed by rich countries.
- The virtual world is not the enemy. The pioneers invented a world they believed in, but the followers must follow that world whether they believe in it or not.
- When I was 16, I felt very relieved to discover cinema. It was like an island where I could see life and death from another perspective. Every young person should be interested in that island. It's a beautiful place.
- I changed my name when I was 13. I don't know why but it made sense at the time. I wanted another identity. I wanted to reinvent myself.
