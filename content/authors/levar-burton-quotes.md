- I have always been a fan of 'Star Trek.' I love Gene Roddenberry's vision of the future.
- I've always been interested in gadgets and technology and I've always been a reader.
- I'm excited to see how current and future technologies revolutionize the way we learn.
- It's not about division. It's not about politics. My concern is how do we come together?
