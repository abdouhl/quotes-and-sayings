- I really enjoy being with my fans. They offer great support and encouragement to me. I like signing autographs and posing for pictures.
- My driving and irons are the best part of my game. Growing to be 5-foot-11 has certainly helped.
- Since I've been home-schooled since sixth grade, I've practiced six to seven hours a day. I wake up, practice for three hours in the morning, eat lunch, and then go out and play eighteen or more holes.
- I'm a big breakfast person: Eggs, bacon and yogurt is my go-to meal before a round. On the course, peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches are great for energy, but a protein bar works, too.
- I started golfing at a young age, and growing up with two older brothers, it made me mature a lot younger.
- I wear pink on Saturdays for breast cancer, and I wear blue on Sundays. I'm superstitious. At the Evian tournament in 2010, in which I came in second, I wore baby blue on a Sunday. And ever since then, I've worn it every Sunday. Puma sponsors me, so I wear all their outfits in bright colors. I wear matching hair ribbons, too.
- I'm not a huge shopper. I love looking good - obviously, on the golf course I like looking sharp, that's for sure. I'm just not into knowing brands.
- I'm pretty much on all social media, but Instagram is the coolest, and I use it the most because I take a lot of pictures and I like to post them, but I link them all to each one.
- You go through slumps in this game, and you just have to work through them. You're going to miss putts out on an LPGA tour and have bad rounds. You just have to think to yourself that you always have tomorrow, and you're lucky enough to be out here just playing golf for a living.
- Sometimes, it just gets mentally tough, but at the end of the day, I'm playing golf for a living. And reaching out to a huge fan base and knowing people are following my progress and looking up to me means the world to me. So if all I have to do is some photo shoots and answer questions, that's nothing to me. That's part of my life.
- I met Taylor Lautner and Jonah Hill at the 'Today Show.' That was pretty cool.
- I have always looked up to my brothers. They are a huge influence on me. We constantly text and Facebook each other to give each other support. And we all hang out at home when we are in town together.
- I like upbeat songs, and I listen to a lot of Linkin Park and Green Day. I also like hip hop and R&B artists such as Drake and Rihanna.
- I've always used a mallet putter on tour. I get too much face rotation with a blade.
- I love my sponsors. They make things so much fun for me. We do really fun and exciting things, so I always have a blast. It doesn't ever seem like work.
- I started with golf because I saw my brothers play, I was always watching them. It was my life. Growing up, we always played competitions like chipping, hitting.
- I go to the movies, and I watch MTV and the Disney Channel. I admit I like 'Hannah Montana.'
