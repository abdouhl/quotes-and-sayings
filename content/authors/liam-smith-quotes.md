- I didn't become world champion to fight Jimmy Kelly.
- I don't care who's in front of me; nobody is going to stop me from winning the world title.

- If Canelo comes too hard at me early, he's going to be in for a long night.
- I'm world champion, so if I'm not ready for another fighter at 154, I don't deserve to be world champion. That's the way I look at it and what I firmly believe.
- Canelo's going to have his moments. I'm not saying he's not. But I'm going to have my moments. It will come down to who can finish off their moments and finish the fight the best.
- I won't watch that Amir fight from now until I fight Alvarez. I'm not a blown up 147 or a Miguel Cotto. I'm a big 154 lb., and I'm coming of age and coming to win.
- I don't want to say 'grateful.' I don't want to sound like I'm just coming for the opportunity and to say I boxed in front of this many people at AT&T Stadium. I'm coming there to win and bring the title back home.

- As soon as I get in a rhythm, I'm very hard to stop.

- Thompson is a typical American: wide feet, good jab; he'll try to have a fight.
- From my point of view, I am the underdog going into this fight. I'm not saying I'm not. But I'm the underdog because I haven't fought at that level yet against anyone of Canelo's level.
- I've been wanting to spar Miguel Cotto over in L.A., and that will be priceless, going over there, getting some rounds with such a world class fighter.
- Now Mayweather has retired, Alavrez is the biggest name in boxing, and I'm looking forward to pitting my wits against him.
- I'm so proud, and it feels brilliant to be a world champion.
- I'll go for the knockout, and if we have to go 12 rounds, then I'll trust the judges to do their best work, and I will get the victory if I deserve it.

- I'm not going to say I'm not ready for a fighter like Canelo Alvarez.
