- I would never say out loud that I am raising my children alone, but a lot of the time it has felt like that.
- I love the fabric of Genetic jeans. There's a softness. I always travel in them. It feels like you're in like your most comfortable pajamas.
- I romanticized domesticity for a while, and loved having a shopping list of groceries stuck to the fridge for the first time.
- What I have always loved about modelling is the chance to play a part. I am quite shy naturally, but I like getting into somebody else's head space, understanding how people work and the psychology behind their actions.
- I have four older siblings and one younger, and all three of my brothers are in the music industry. My dad was really involved in music, too, with the disco, and he also started Radio Caroline and was the one who invented pirate radio, if you like, off on a coast in England on a boat.
- I love going out dancing. There is nothing better than letting your hair down and staying up far too late, is there?
- My favourite designers always create a strong silhouette, like McQueen and Tom Ford and Alaia. I like structured things that you can throw on, and it's almost like armour, and you're, like, ready for the day.
- I love heels, and as a size 36, I've accumulated a wall of amazing high heels from catwalk shows over the years where designers had to make especially small shoes. Tom Ford's golden versions are my favourite. I do, however, also live in my flat Saint Laurent Chelsea boots or Givenchy sneakers.
- Everyone lives under their rocks in L.A., so it takes a long time to find your lane.
- I worked a lot with Nick Knight and John Galliano when John was at Dior. He also made my wedding dress. He'll always hold a special place; I have most of my memorable, iconic moments in fashion with him.
- I still have my Levi's jacket that I bought on the Portobello Road when I was 14, and it's like part of me, you know, it's got oils in it, and it's my comfort, security blanket or something.
- Acting is a bigger step into modelling in a way. Modelling is easier when you don't look like yourself. When you look like a different person, you feel different. Acting goes deeper into that; you have to move and talk like that character. I love it.
- No life is perfect; we all have our problems and issues, and I believe that it's good to be true to who you are.
- Trusting your gut is always the best thing - no matter what people around you insist you should be doing or saying or thinking. Only you know and once you live in truth,your heart is completely free.
- I honestly don't think about myself; it's more about my kids. They were both born in L.A., and they're like little beams of sun, little tornadoes, and they can't be in a confined space. And one of the things I love most about L.A. is the freedom there.
- I'm terrible at sticking to any sort of diet. The more I think I can't eat something, the more I want to eat it. And I know this is the most annoying thing for a girl to say, but I'm just really lucky; I can eat pretty much what I want.
- I went from the glamour of working with Karl Lagerfeld and John Galliano to living on an isolated hilltop, with my husband gone most of the time.
- Acting has always been something I've wanted to get into. I think the best models are actors; you're taking on a character. In that sense, I have been acting for a long time. It didn't seem like a crazy transition.
- I believe in love, and I have no trouble with commitment or loyalty; that's never been a problem for me.
- There's a jean for everyone. And I'm a fan of that. I love a jean, and I love all these spins on them. I love a printed Balmain jean, or a Givenchy, and I love the prints, I love that you can have so much fun with it all, you know, dressing up.
- I love when girls wear print-on-print. It looks so cool.
- The most valuable thing I can share is the importance of living in truth. Sometimes, facing those truths can actually be your worst fear.
- I have created a capsule collection for Genetic inspired by memories of growing up in LA. Denim has always been my go-to, especially during my modelling days. I discovered Genetic Denim about five years ago - they are so comfy, you could almost be wearing your pyjamas.
- The first years of my life were spent in a roller disco in the early '80s called Flipper's. It was a real riotous, incredible time. I am slightly obsessed with the place.
- I have five siblings, so my mom was always pregnant, and she would wear these dungarees that looked so cool.
- My eldest brother Atticus just won an Oscar some years ago, as he wrote the music for 'The Social Network.'
- My mum had this idea I was going to be this long-haired hippie playing guitar and bought me one when I was 13, but my little brother picked it up instead and was such a natural, he kept it! Io Echo is a band my brother now plays in; they're really good.
- Whatever I wear has to be comfortable.
- My father ran a famous L.A. nightclub complete with roller-rink - Flippers - in the early Eighties which was the West Coast's answer to Studio 54.
