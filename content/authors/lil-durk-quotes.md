- I grew up without a father, so I have to be on point for my kids.
- You've got Lil Uzi Vert - you do a song with him, you ain't doing nothing but gaining new fans. You gotta keep up with the time and the pace.
- I met Jay Z. I don't really care about all that though.
- I've been with Def Jam Records for five years and they gave me my first recording contract so for that I'm forever grateful.
- When you in the studio you don't need everybody calling your phone telling you about what's going on outside the studio. I don't need those distractions.
- I wasn't really into music. I was into the streets. I was too worried about the streets and how I was going to eat and how I was going to make the streets happen.
- I'm my own boss, you know?
- I don't want to try to piggyback off of anybody else.
- I don't want my kids to be on the streets period. I want my kids to be nerds. I want them to be book smart or playing sports - I don't want them to know nothing about the streets.
- I use the studio as my drug. That's where I relieve everything at - the studio.
- It feels good to be in a place now where I can give back to my community.
- Moving to Atlanta is one of the best things I did.
- What really broke it down was I had my son while I was locked up, so that really affected me. I can't really have this, knowing my father was locked up when I was small. So that really out of everything - through the fame, the money, everything - that really put the toll on me: 'Oh yeah, I gotta change.'
- Something happened in the studio that was between me and Tyga that ain't supposed to escalate, but it did. Something happened with a song we did, and he ain't like it.
- My message is just showing people how I came from nothing.
- I worked with Ty Dolla Sign, YG, Nipsey Hussle, Metro Boomin - I build relationships, and I try to stay afloat with everyone who is hot or cool, period.
- 'L's,' it represents life. That's what I represent it as, life. When you throw the L's up for life, you can't go wrong. Like, no gang-banging, nothing like that.
- I would say I grew without a doubt. My whole energy in life - as an artist and as a person - has definitely got me smarter and wiser.
- I'll never stick to one sound, I switch it up.
- 'Trap House' is one of my favorite songs off '300 Days 300 Nights' mixtape, I sent it to Thug, he loved it and knocked it out on the spot in Atlanta.
- I listen to different artists. I open my mind to different artists.
- Growing up in Chicago is hard. I'd say 80 percent of the people ain't really got no daddies. Their household wasn't right. All they know is the streets and getting some money to support each other and support their family.
- I feel like with '2.5,' I created another style that nobody else is coming with.
- I'm really living my dream so if I were to change anything up, I probably wouldn't be where I am.
- I never thought I would see the outside of Chicago.
- When I do shows, I take pictures and make the fans feel like family. All of that really matters. That's the cheat code if you ain't got a hit.
- I was 17 and out of school, living with my mom, starving, not eating, getting locked up, no focus, no guidance. When you ain't got no guidance, you can't do too much. But then I had my first son and started working. I got the right people around me.
- I want to do, like, 50 records.
- There's definitely a lot of responsibility to keep the good energy going.
- I want to relate. I don't want to just rap and go to the next album.
- Always read your contract. Know what you're getting yourself into. Know your worth.
- I let my partners and my DJ listen to my songs and if they say, 'Oh yeah I felt that one' or 'I am feeling that' then I write it down and we just continue building the album from there.
- I wanna get the streets riled back up. I wanna get super tours and bookings.
- My thing is to get new fans. So I love when people say, 'Oh, I've heard of him before.' Or 'I've never heard of Durk.' Or 'I'm a fan of Durk today.' This is what I like to see, because it lets me know when I come out with something that it's going to work.
- Bone Thugs is one of my favorite rap groups of all time. I listened to them all the time when I was a kid.
- I ain't expect it. I just expected to be Chicago famous - 'hood famous. I ain't expect to be outside-of-Chicago famous.
- Atlanta is just different. It's the music city.
- I'm just trying to show people that I ain't gotta ride off no movement. I can ride off myself.
- Death can happen anywhere, but kids in Chicago, like 4 years old, can get shot. You don't really hear that in too many places.
- I just want to be there for my kids.
- I can buy anything I want now. It hasn't changed me personally. It just changed what I can do for myself and my family.
- A lot of projects I do be all 'real' music.
- In Chicago, a lot of people don't really got nothing to live for. Everybody can't ball. Everybody can't rap. Nobody is really doing those activities. There's nothing to do but the streets.
- I had a bad background just growing up as a child.
- No shade to the other artists in Chicago... but if you got confidence in yourself and you know you're Number One, say it.
- I made 'LS4TS2' for women, my Day 1's, the trenches, and all those that doubted me.
- You got to have a strong mind if you fall back. When you fall back, they going to count you out. So you got to have a strong mind and know your worth. When you come back, you've got to be different and even more better.
- I been living down in Atlanta, but everyone back home has been in my thoughts, especially those doing something for the community and all the neighborhood heroes. I thought about all the first responders putting their lives on the line to help out and it inspired me, so I took a jet back to Chicago to show my thanks.
- See what I do is I book a studio that's closed down and I go by myself. No one's in there, literally just me and the engineer.
- My father being incarcerated for 25 years, 26 years, so I had a rough past, but me moving to Atlanta, I just thought that changed my whole identity - my thinking.
- We came from nothing really. One house. Ten people. Even days the lights was off. The worst days was not eating. Surviving off rice and toast.
- I was 17 when I first started rapping and 18 before I started taking it seriously - when I really knew I could rap and have fans and be a trendsetter.
- Certain parts are bad in every city, but Chicago is beautiful.
- I'm always going to be able to touch fans and get new fans because everybody goes through something everyday. I just keep touching different subjects by talking to the streets and reaching out to my fans by telling them a story instead of just giving them music to listen.
- I don't throw shade at anybody like, 'You sound like me.'
- Put your own twist to it. That's how you say relevant. Or things get old and boring.
- I rock with Chance, I rock with Kanye, I rock with Common.
- I just want to paint that picture of Chicago that everybody's missing, and I just want to rap about it.
- It's either you finna create your own wave, you finna sound like me or you finna sound like G Herbo, you finna sound like Chance The Rapper, you finna sound like Juice Wrld. You ain't gonna get too far 'cause you sound like somebody. So, create your own lane and do your own style.
- If you got a vibe with a producer I think you should go full-fledged instead of being satisfied with two songs.
- I gotta stay in that light where people will see me and hear me. And not be scared of me, you know?
- I have three kids, and that's a big part of staying focused.
- Everybody always going to sound like somebody. You got to separate yourself.
- With 'LilDurk2x,' it's a good vibe to it, good energy.
- I just moved to Atlanta so the change of scenery and environment put me in a different mood and a different vibe, both good.
- I like aiming for the producers who are hungry. I don't chase the wave.
- I think every artist should go for a Grammy.
- I'm big on the studio. I like to stay in it 24/7.
- I stay in the studio. I'm a studio junkie.
- I don't wish jail on nobody, not even my worst enemies.
- I just wanted to speak to the streets and give them motivation on making it out. Whatever situation they're in, know that they can make do and have a better life.
- You got to want to evolve. It's something you can practice on but it just came to me. I wasn't really sitting there like, 'What can I do to get better?' It just came to me, talking to my people and my crew. They just tell me what my strongest and weakest points are at.
- I grew as an artist and a person. I'm just ready to work, get this money, get this new fan base and tour all over the world.
- I don't think anybody feels safe in Chicago. Bullets ain't got no name on them.
- When I began to rap, I wasn't taking it real serious. As I start seeing good things, it's getting serious.
- I want my kids to be able to live comfortable and go to school and to be into sports.
- Once upon a time, I was really lost. I was 18 going on 19, and I was shy. All I want to do is get money, and the way I was thinking I was going to do that was a negative route.
- I let my team pick what order the records go. I don't pick my own records. I'm a fan of my music regardless so you have to think outside of the box.
- Atlanta is definitely where it's at. I still go back to Chicago a lot though, I got family there.
- Rapping is my dream, but my kids make me happy.
- I'm happy with the person I become.
