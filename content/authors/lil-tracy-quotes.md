- I know what my fans have wanted from me this whole time. 'Bad For You' and 'Anarchy' is me finally giving it to them.
- I rep Peep, I have him in the middle of my face. It's not a replica tat, it's not something he had, it's my own thing.
- When I feel some type of way, I can't think straight.
- I used to get in a lot of trouble.
- So all I really seen my whole life is just Myspace and Instagram and Facebook and Twitter and YouTube.
- I don't want to die. I'm scared.
- When people close to me die, I never feel bad for myself. I feel bad for them because they was good at living, and they don't get to do it no more.
- Whenever I'd get in trouble, my mom would send me to Seattle, and when I would get in trouble there, I'd get sent back to Virginia.
- The way I became 'Lil Tracy' was Nedarb was throwing away his old clothes, then there was this old Tracy McGrady jersey. I put it on and I was like 'I'm Lil Tracy!'
- I was definitely super rebellious, and my music is that.
- I use my music to kind of lead my feelings. I feel like if I make a happier sound, I will be happier.
- I always liked the guitar sound.
- The first day I met Peep we made a song without question. Never in my life have I connected with someone like that. Literally the first day we met we recorded 'White Tee' and shot the video.
- 'Anarchy' was more of a tribute album to my friend Peep.
- There was a point where people would mention that I was black everyday.
- I hate when people try to put me in one category.
- I got caught doing graffiti with my friend in broad daylight once.
- I actually started making beats first and that was before 2010. I think I was like 14. They were really bad. I used to sample like Arabic music for some reason.
- I'm just happy to be his son. I don't know, I just feel lucky, really. I feel like I was given a power.
- I'm just a normal, nice dude.
- 'Shame,' really it was about people from my hometown who just spread hate about me and just aren't nice to me. And I just felt like that was a shame, so that's really what that stems from.
- Your friend dies, and people always say, 'Oh, he lives through me,' or whatever. But it's just sad that they're not living. If a person dies that's close to them, then they say, 'I lost this person.' It always tripped me out because I would always be like, 'Yeah, but that person lost their life.'
