- I'm so grateful that the Internet and the DVD came along because, otherwise, something like 'Freaks And Geeks' would have been dead. At the time we made the show, those avenues weren't really available, and the idea of the show carrying on after it was canceled was something that didn't really happen.
- I think I'm going to spend some time learning how to be a first-time mom, and then I'll go back to work.
- One of my favorite things to do is not to speak on screen. In theater it's different because there's a lot of emphasis on language - it's a different medium. But that is one of the most wonderful things about film. A person's face can say so much more than their voice can.
- There are not that many jobs as an actor where you don't get to know what your character will be doing from episode to episode.
- Just because someone isn't working at an office doesn't mean they're not working hard at something.
- I'm enjoying being a woman on-screen.
- I think there's this thing that happens when you're younger: The things that you want are different than when you're older, and sometimes the person that you liked when you were a teenager is not necessarily the person that you would want to settle down with for the rest of your life once you're older, more mature, and have kids.
- Yes, I'm very close to my family. And being that close to your family, I think you also struggle with how to become your own person.
- I'm a huge Ang Lee fan and a huge Larry McMurtry fan.
- I think in real life most of us don't know how to communicate our deepest feelings very well.
- My first-ever celebrity crush was Val Kilmer from 'Top Secret!' Not his biggest film, but I remember loving him in that movie.
- At the beginning of my career, I worked for a lot of people who nobody knew, who have come up to be people that everybody knows.
- I like diversity; I want one character to be very different from the next. I love to live with a character for a long time if I can, but I like one character to be different from the next.
- After I finished 'E.R.', I wanted to concentrate on re-examining what kind of actress I am and taking time for real-life things.
- People who have no idea it's me when they first see me playing something, and later they realize, 'That's her from whatever it is,' it's a great compliment that they can forget.
- Living in Florida, I keep the sun out of my face as much as possible with a nice sun hat, sunglasses, and a sundress I can wear for all occasions.
- You know, the hard thing about audiences not liking what a character does is that they sometimes take it out on the actor personally. That's something that you know when you become an actor or actress, but it's always hard to deal with when it actually happens.
- I think, you know, actors rely on each other all the time.
- Before I could talk, I would try to sing.
- The one thing about being on 'ER' that has changed is that I'm more easily recognizable.
- I started in theatre, moved into film and television, and started doing voice work, which is funny because after a long time in film and television, you forget how much you rely on just a simple look on your face.
- I thought, 'When I get pregnant, someone will be looking for a pregnant woman. I'll do a movie about a pregnant woman.' But that didn't happen.
- I have a sister, in particular, who's 13 years older than me. So growing up and watching her - watching her go to work, especially - was hugely influential to me. As the youngest, with a sibling that's a decade older, I had certain things that I would go to her about instead of my mother.
- Michael Keaton is amazing. He's one of my favorite actors. To get to work with him was a privilege and really was a wonderful thing.
- I was extremely close with my parents. Breaking away from that is a double-edged sword: It's something you need to do, but it's hard to cut the apron strings.
- I just got back from Switzerland, which I've never been to. I went to Switzerland and Amsterdam.
- Life keeps moving, and to try to stay still is like trying to hold grains of sand in your hand.
- 'Out There' has more of a 'Freaks And Geeks' feel to it, while 'Gravity Falls' has more of a 'Scooby Doo' feel.
- I learned that on kids' shows, you have to eat a lot of stuff. A lot of the humor comes from food and gross-out humor.
- One thing I like about trying to write is that I can possibly write myself a role. Otherwise, you're at the mercy of whatever roles are out there that people are willing to give to you.
- Being raised Catholic myself, I think people who are Catholic tend to carry a lot of guilt. It's almost a joke.
- My mom is a very independent person, and she's the funniest, smartest person in the room, all the time.
- I think everyone feels lost at times during their high school years.
- Some people go through a rebellious phase, and they separate and understand that they're not who their family thinks they are.
- It's fun, with 'Bloodline,' because people who come up and recognize me for that really want to know what's happening. The people who have binge-watched it are very obsessed with the characters, which I love.
- I've always loved donuts. I can't go near one or eat one, because then I'm just done for. I always want more.
- I have sort of the career where, if you are a fan, you've been following me for a while, and you really like something that I've done, so meeting those people is always a really gracious experience.
- I remember when I took the role on E.R., I thought, 'I haven't really been able to play a working class woman. I've played girls, I've played funny, but I haven't played a working class woman. That sounds like something I'd like to do.'
- More and more, I realise I have a distinct voice, which I didn't realise! You know, it's just my voice. I had no idea. A lot of times, people will say now, 'I recognised you from your voice,' which is interesting to me.
- The first time I ever experienced someone hating something I did on television was on 'Boy Meets World.' I remember these kids coming up to me and calling me a 'home-wrecker,' and so I had flashes of that going into my role on 'Mad Men.'
- I don't think I gave my mom too much trouble as a teenager.
- I always thought I was a little shy, especially compared to my brother and my sister, but I guess I was always the kid doing performances in the front room.
- When I was a kid, 'Scooby Doo' was, hands down, my favorite cartoon. Even when I was older, when I was in college studying and I needed to tune out for a while, I'd watch 'Scooby Doo.'
- I love to work on a set whether it's mostly men or mostly women, but there's something about being in a community of women that changes the energy.
- I'd always wanted to try my hand at every bit of the acting field.
- I had a really scary pregnancy and a very difficult delivery. My daughter and I are lucky to be alive.
- I like watching the other actors, but the hard thing about watching yourself is that the performance is done, and no matter how you'd like to tweak it, there's nothing you can do.
