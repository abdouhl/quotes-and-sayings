- People think modeling's mindless, that you just stand there and pose, but it doesn't have to be that way. I like to have a lot of input. I know how to wear a dress, whether it should be shot with me standing or sitting.
- Fashion faux pas should be celebrated. I enjoy them because it means we're not all clones.
- Within two months I made the grand slam: covers of 'American Vogue', 'Italian Vogue', 'British Vogue', and 'French Vogue'.

- I don't get out of bed for less than $10,000 a day.
