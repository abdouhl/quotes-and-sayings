- Olympic Style lifting compliments sprint training perfectly. It does this by making sure everything in the body is 'fully connected.' This is based on the principle that all movements have a kinetic chain.

- If you criticise something then you have to have an alternative, but we do have to try and improve things.

- When I was competing, I cut out red meat but only because I felt it took too long to digest, so I stuck to chicken and fish.

- I've done my country proud.

- People live, people die. It's always hard when it's a member of your family.
- I used to say to my opponents: 'If you let me beat you, I'm going to tell your kids you were beaten by an older man.' When I beat them I would tell them I did it with a slight hamstring problem or that I was only feeling 80 per cent fit.
- There was no money in the sport but we'd be out there day in, day out, rain or shine, doing it.
- I think it's great that they are getting funding, but it's just too easy. They don't have to work for it. We did it because we had pride, because we loved it.
- We have got to go out there and deliver, go on the streets and find athletes, improve facilities around the country and find coaches. We have got to go out there and search for a star.

- I've never enjoyed being cooped up.
- I think there's institutionalised racism in this country.

- I don't think there are really enough meetings in Britain for our athletes to compete properly, and because of this a lot of the talent we have has been stunted.
- Regardless of what I've ever done or will ever do, I'll always be black.
- I am a coach on the outside of the establishment and that works.
