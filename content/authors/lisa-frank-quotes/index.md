- I'm a lunatic.
- I have always wanted to do a feature film that brings the world of Lisa Frank to life. We have so much backstory on our characters, and they have been alive in my imagination since the beginning.
- My house really is purple and yellow and hot pink and light green and orange.
- If I could do anything, I think a theme park. Because the world of Lisa Frank really is a world. And I think, before I die, we should have that world someplace, not just on paper. I think that would be pretty awesome.
- If I use my credit card... and they go, 'Oh my gosh, there's Lisa Frank who makes the stickers!' I go, 'Isn't that the craziest thing, that I have the same name?'
- At first, I didn't want to do unicorns. The artist in me said no. Then I thought, 'Wait a minute: this is commercial art. Let's do what's going to sell.'
- I think I always wanted to be an artist. I sort of just followed my passion right out of high school, and everything kind of evolved for me.
- Both of my folks were into art. My dad was an art collector, my mom had a little kiln in our basement, and we would make pottery. I think from about age five on, they sent me to art classes, and I was a huge colorer.
- I would say there is probably a little bit of me in each character. But Purrscilla is a lot like me because she is very into glam and glitz and jewelry and everything very girly. And some of the jewelry in the illustration is even my own jewelry. But I'm not a cat fan - that's the only thing! I'm a dog person.
