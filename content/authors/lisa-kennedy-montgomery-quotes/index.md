- Beto is banking on his sacharrine positivity as the ultimate antidote to President Trump's honest saltiness.

- I definitely think my ancestry has something to do with my politics. And I think being deeply suspicious of government and communists is implicit in a lot of first-generation immigrants, particularly from Eastern Europe.

- I didn't like Jenny McCarthy when I first met her.
- What's great about MTV is that it belongs to whatever generation is the steward at the time.
- If people want to watch music videos you can go to Youtube. But it would be great if there was still music on TV that people could check out and be visually excited by an artist.
- Style in New York is much more accessorized and tailored and L.A. is way more flowy and day-to-evening. It is fluid and a lot of flip-flops and long skirts, which I think is great.

- There's a difference between John Bolton and Mike Pompeo.

- God bless America!
- I come from a very long line of very superstitious Romanian women who hold on to their chastity probably way too long.
- There really shouldn't be public schools, should there?
- All fraudulent elections should be condemned, including those in Turkey and Russia. And we need to be doubly mindful not to indulge amateur socialists in this country, because even though a Bernie Sanders presidency is a joke, the consequences of diet communism are deadly serious.
- I do watch reality TV every night.
- Pulling punches because someone happens to be a woman is disgusting.

- Caving into blather and peer pressure never bolstered anyone's argument.

- I have never kissed a woman, but Madonna in all her glory with coney bras and burgundy black 'Vogue' lips makes me rethink my heterosexuality.
- We don't need any more regulation from government. You don't need overarching moralism to tell you how to live because human beings actually have a pretty well-developed moral center. The more government intrudes on the basic decisions you make, the further away you get from your natural morality.
- Leaders' like Maduro, Erdogan and Putin hate freedom because it gives filthy peasants too much say and power over their own lives.
- I loved my time at MTV because the music was critical; the music was our thrust. That's what the channel was all about. And I loved that, because we were pushing the limits with how we were covering and interviewing and consuming music and bands.
- It is never ok for politicians to abuse their power for self enrichment, and even for has-beens and also-rans there has to be some brand of justice so present and future presidents don't get lured into taking crafty, well disguised bribes pretending it's 'charity.'
- In politics there is plenty of division, hostility, tribalism, posturing; but there's almost no curiosity. Instead of wondering why someone holds a certain set of beliefs and asking how they came to them, it is easier to gather a mob and silence opposing viewpoints by force.
- If Rick Santorum and Rachel Maddow are both gunning for you, it probably means you're on the right track.

- Socialism is antithetical to freedom, because when it breeds and thrives, people die.

- People at Fox are very close, and always feel like they're part of something. We may not agree on every issue, but it is a very special place.
- With debt free college there is absolutely no incentive to rein in administrative costs when the government is foolishly pushing everyone to get a degree, regardless of need or desire, which only perpetuates the silly cycle for another generation.
- My mom was very disappointed when I came out as a Republican in high school. And being a Republican in high school was really fun because all of my teachers were extremely liberal. Expressing anything that was counter to their deeply held beliefs was so easily unsettling that that form of contrarianism was very comfortable.
- What people consider my worst interviews were kind of the best, as well, in a way, because they were so surreal, like J Mascis.
- Like sexual harassment in the workplace and two-martini lunches, VJs are the stuff of legend whose time and train have passed, but I was fortunate enough to sneak into the express and ride it through the greatest age.
- Easy spying is supposed to nab bad guys, but what happens when the small cabal of desperate men who head the security state see the future president as the bad guy?
- What's cooler than pretending you hate money and giving away someone else's stuff under the guise of 'fairness?' You know what's cooler than that? Having the ability to make your own money, your own damn choices and not being subjected to mob theft that steals opportunity right out from under you.
- It's really rare that you get to work with people who are passionate about what they do and show up every day and really put themselves into something.
- Madonna taught me more philosophy than Ayn Rand.
- I have nothing wrong with comics and writers poking fun at the President, as long as it's funny. When it's the same retread jokes with predictable punchlines, that's when it's offensive.
- When the tax law changes and people are allowed to choose where their hard earned money goes, then do-gooders can opt to have their money go wherever they see fit. I would rather keep mine and invest and donate with greater efficiency.
- Heavy handedness and entitlement goody bags are no way to solve our immigration and border crisis, but I've learned to expect almost nothing from the dimwits in power who feel entitled to take everything.

- Parents, teachers, professors, economists, pundits, entrepreneurs, tinkerers and misfits all have to do a better job of unapologetically singing the praises of capitalism and free markets which unequivocally demonstrate the ability to pull people out of poverty and improve and lengthen their lives.
- Implying women are too weak to take a joke is *implicitlty* sexist, and ridiculous.
- Conservatives who decried Trump's rise (and those who scoffed at his chances of winning a single primary were legion) are the same 'purist' boxing snobs who could never grasp the popularity - and populist legitimacy - of wrestling.

- Here is a piece of advice: If you want to strengthen your views, challenge them.
- I love the influence of surf culture on fashion in L.A.

- It was Comey who wrecked the FBI and allowed this witches brew of biased managers to simmer and boil over when things didn't go as he planned.
- Everyone wants to be liked. It's a basic human impulse for some of you, and that explains the turn-on-a-dime hypocrisy from people like Jim Carrey and Sean Penn.
- I loved 'Breaking Bonaduce.' I was amazed it made it on TV. It was so raw, so disturbing.
- It's hard to pin Beto down on what he really stands for. Between the clumsy apologies and vacant platitudes, he doesn't seem to have a set of philosophical priorities other than using his goofy ears to do a lot of listening so he doesn't have to make any truly bold policy declarations.
- People think that libertarians are probably greedy and anti-social, and I'm sure some of them are. But the nice thing about it is, it's really an umbrella term that covers a lot of different people.
- If you think about the kind of people you want to have in this country, you want people who are hardworking, people who are ethical, people who look out for their families and their communities and people who are very physically strong.
- I don't have the stomach for 'Fear Factor.'
- I'm consistently pro-freedom. No matter where I go, whether it's Fox or when I'm walking around the block or going to the dog park, I will agree with people on pretty much half of everything. Freedom is something I believe in across the board, and I will fight for that.
- Both my parents were Democrats. My dad was definitely more of a fiscally conservative traditional Democrat. My mom was more of a feminist Camelot Democrat. They definitely had an idealistic view of life as it should be in the United States. And they had a sense that government had to have some hand in making people's lives better.
- James Comey is a corrupt, narcissistic weirdo.
- Beto O'Rourke speaks in annoyingly pert platitudes like some mediocre yoga instructor who promises to 'build a movement.'
