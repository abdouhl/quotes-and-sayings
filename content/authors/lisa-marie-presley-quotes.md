- I have a lot of memories, but I don't go into capitalizing on that. Something's got to be my own. I'm not doing the record to sit here and broadcast my memories of my father.
- I have a tendency to kick it up. I like to rattle the cage.
- I'm more prone to his '70s material, which is what I was around for and watched a lot. I listen to a lot of that stuff. It probably influenced me quite a bit. I'm more drawn to the darker, sadder songs.
- I don't do yoga. I bite the hella outta my nails. I smoke, I eat all the wrong food, I don't exercise.
- Music has always gotten me through life, particularly honest, real music.
- I like Jailhouse Rock and Love Me Tender. The black-and-white films. With music, I tend more toward the '70s stuff because I was at the shows for those, so they bring back memories.
- I don't ascribe to any particular style or period.
- I sit with the intention to write a record.
- I don't deal well with admiration if it's for something I haven't done. Other than exist.
- I really went back through a lot of the dark corridors of my life in this. I wanted people to know who I am based on my music, not on what they read in the tabloids.
- If I'm alone too long I think too much, and I'm not interested in doing that. That won't lead anywhere good, I'm sure. If I'm busy I tend to stay out of trouble. An idle mind is the devil's playground.
- I do like to write nasty songs. It's a useful weapon to have, and it's cathartic as well, because I create art out of anger, something positive out of something negative.
- I've never even been out of my BMI range. I'm 5-foot-3. If I gain five pounds, it shows.
- Anybody in the spotlight can get lost in that if they are not careful.
- I knew that because of who I am, and the situation I'm in, that I'd attract more critics than your average person, and that was a little intimidating, but I wanted to get out there and pay my dues.
- I wanted to come through with my own voice and, hopefully, have it affect people. I want people to know that I'm not an Elvis impersonator.
- People that were in my life for a long time turned sinister and tried to control me, and all kinds of weird stuff happened. But there was no conscience involved; that threw me more than anything.
- When I'm doing interviews, I'm doing interviews, and when I am writing, I'm writing. I sit there with a musician and I write. It's the same process since I started writing in my twenties. I like to come in and leave with a finished song.
- I have always been a singer/songwriter, and I was pushed in places I didn't want to do, like pop or top forty. I don't belong there.
- I'm not eager to jump into marriage again. I'm in the corner right now, wearing my dunce cap. That area is obviously a nightmare.
- I have loved music so much from when I was little, and I don't know whether it was because I saw my dad doing it and then I got the idea; I don't know what came first... But I always had a hairbrush in the mirror singing. I was always with him backstage; I would go out and be pulled in for the last song.
- I went through a huge transition in my life where everything and everyone I knew and trusted didn't turn out to be that way.
- I don't think that I'm a top 40 artist in any way. So I don't think I'm that mainstream.
- It's hard for me to be happy because I'm always worried about something going awry or what could happen to screw it up. It's hard for me to sit and look around, going, 'Ah, I'm really happy.' I'm not that kind of person.
- I was always writing music anyway. I just sort of fell into it. Writing for me is a therapeutic process.
- I'm a hypochondriac. Yesterday it was brain damage from the vodka the night before. Today, heart attack - my arm and chest started hurting at the same time.
- I'm one of those people that, if I hear about something happening, I go crazy. I want to go help.
- I never not wanted to be a singer. Since I was 3, I knew this was what I wanted to do. Well, I can't say I wanted to do it, but I fantasized and thought about it all the time. I never thought it would actually happen.
- I'm just not interested in selling out to get on the charts and make people happy.
- Mostly singing was cathartic, writing was cathartic, therapeutic. I don't think I had a goal, particularly, to sing or put it out there for anybody.
- I take a situation, analyse it, break it down, put it in the form I want it to be in, and then I toss it away. Let somebody else go deal with it.
- I've been chased through airports with a screaming baby because the photographers are ruthless, and they want the picture.
- I'm not doing this to be a pop star. I've had plenty of money and attention. I'm doing it for credibility.
- I like helping children. I have a big thing with children. You can correspond with the child, send something to them as a gift. You know it's actually getting there and you are doing something to help.
- How many people have a family grave in the backyard? I'm sure I'll end up there, or I'll shrink my head and put it in a glass box in the living room. I'll get more tourists to Graceland that way.
- When I write, it's purging for me. It's a therapeutic process.
- I'm trying to have my own thing, and I don't know if it's even possible. I didn't realize so many people actually think I'm trying to be like my dad. I read comments like 'She's no Elvis.' I'm not trying to be. I never set out to be.
- I want to pave my own path artistically.
- With a lot of hair and make-up then I'm possibly, remotely attractive. But it's rare, I don't think I'm ugly but I'm nothing particularly special. I'm not a yoga and health girl. I don't exercise that much and I eat crap and smoke and bite my nails.
- I was quite the spoiled brat. I have quite a temper, obviously inherited from my father, and I became very good at ordering everyone around. I was the princess; the staff were absolutely terrified of me.
- I'll say it loud and say it proud. I'm completely insane.
- I would describe my aesthetic as definitely personal and harmonious with an eclectic yet bohemian sensibility.
- I remember him watching me through the crack of a door singing with a hairbrush. I was in front of his mirror. I think he wanted me to sing. He would get me on the table and make me sing sometimes or play the piano. He was very encouraging on that front.

- I work because I think that I wouldn't feel good about myself unless I was contributing.
- I think having kids just makes you want to do things to help people. You have children, and you see how fragile and innocent and helpless they are when they first start out. If they are going to be a victim of whatever they are surrounded by, I just do everything I can to try to make whatever change I can.
- I have, in the past, been attracted to really strong and dominant men. But on the other side, I have been attracted to very androgynous men. I don't typically fall for your average jock. I just like people that are a little atypical.
- If you lined up everyone I've ever dated, you wouldn't see any similarities.

- I'm a lot of work.
