- I was a blueberry picker, bindery worker, bookstore clerk and later manager, and a Realtor.
- Seriously, I dreamed that I was in my husband's dream, watching what he was dreaming about. Like, I was in his dream as an onlooker. It was so weird that I immediately wrote it down in the middle of the night. In the morning, it still sounded cool.
- I would love to go to Greece.
- One of my favorite ways to write paranormal, as in the 'Wake' trilogy, is to write very normal characters with just a hint of something other-worldly. Like somewhere, maybe, someone really can get sucked into other people's dreams.
- I had one of those defining moments in the fourth grade when my teacher said the story I wrote was the best in the class, and therefore I would be going Young Authors Conference where I'd get to hang out with authors all day.
- I would like to be able to disappear whenever I do something dorky.
- I went to Holland Christian High School in Holland, Michigan, and to Calvin College in Grand Rapids, Michigan.
- I vividly remember sixth grade. It's the year when kids turn mean, and it's definitely no longer okay to cry in public. So we force our hot tears back, and they burn our throats all the way down.
- I love Chris Crutcher, Sara Zarr, Lois Lowry, Elizabeth Scott, Madeleine L'Engle, Gordon Korman, Michelle Magorian, Heather Bouwman.
- I've always found teenagers really interesting. I think they've got so much going on in their lives, so that lends itself really well to fiction because there's so much drama, so much activity, so much growth.
- Nearly every notable event in 'Wake' has a date or a time stamp.
- I don't see a day when teenagers don't read. They are very enthusiastic. That is so inspiring to me.
- Who hasn't had the 'I went to school/work in my underwear' dream?
