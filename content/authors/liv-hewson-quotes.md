- I was asked recently about the fact I show my body more in 'Homecoming Queens' than I have in other things and whether that was difficult to do. I never thought twice about it.
- When we see a difference in media, we're more likely to accept it in our lives, and when we accept it in our lives, we also want to see more of it in media.
- You do some acting in a room for a few minutes, hopefully get something out of it that makes you a bit better at acting, and go home. Maybe the people in the room with you liked the acting you did. Maybe they didn't! Either way, it's not the end of the world; you'll be doing this again soon.
- One of the things I love about my job is that it offers me an opportunity to step into different people and different spaces and different kinds of work in every new thing that I do. I'm just looking forward to the surprises I'm going to have.

- When I was sent the material for auditions for 'Dramaworld,' I didn't know much about the international fandom surrounding Korean dramas.
- I speak publicly about the things I am speaking privately about, and there is no difference - the things I'm passionate about and dissecting with my friends and family, the things that are valuable to me, are the things that I publicly share and publicly promote.
- Anytime you're telling a story about monsterhood, you're playing around with ideas about otherness and alienation.
- Actors don't hate acting. Most people don't hate acting! Whether you're a child mucking around with your friends or a grown up being paid to be on a set, pretending to be other people is fun.
- I started in theatre when I was a teenager, and I sort of fell into screen acting by accident because I had friends who were at university studying how to be filmmakers, and they didn't have to pay me to be in their student films.
