- If I really want to be heard, I have that command, but a lot of heavy women don't. When I see someone heavy working on television, I say, 'Oh, God, go girl. You do it.' You know, it shouldn't stop your life.
- I'm Hispanic - don't mess around with my coffee. Leave my beans alone.
- I never thought I had a career. I think Meryl Streep has a career. I have jobs that I am lucky to get... I'm one of those actresses who never turns down a part, no matter how small. I don't have the luxury of picking and choosing. I take everything.
- I'm always striving to lose weight. And it's not a matter of wanting to be a size 3 again - I brought out my leotards, and a friend thought they were doll clothes. Being heavy isn't good for you. How long can your heart take the strain? So, I never give up, but it's hard.
- I have a stationary bike that I do twice a week, but I'm not really serious about it. I just do it until I get tired. And then I have a step thing that I really hate. It's hard on your knees. I have a treadmill that keeps getting stuck. It's nice to have equipment around, though, because you can sit on it anytime.
