- Gilmore Girls' was really a training ground for so many things. It's a real endurance lesson.
- But yeah, it's funny because I used to talk so fast before 'Gilmore Girls' and it took me several years of auditioning and being comfortable in auditions to sort of take my time because I would just go into it and rush, rush, rush.
- The thing that's the most lovely to me, looking back at my time on 'Gilmore Girls', was how fortunate I was to be a young actor and to be on a show that made it really cool for girls to be smart.
- It's a lot of feelings, I think, when people so strongly associate an actor with a character they play - but the main feeling is I feel very happy that I've been able to play somebody that people connect so strongly to.
- It's very bizarre to me to now really be a grown-up. I kind of can't believe that I'm there because I certainly don't feel that way a lot of the time.
- I did feel like I had a relationship and knew so many people in 'Shondaland,' and that certainly made me feel very welcomed.
- I think I'm starting to be able to stand a little taller. I feel like I paid my dues and I feel like I deserve to be where I am. I feel like I've worked really hard.
- Gilmore Girls' felt very apart from everything else that was happening. I felt very lucky to be able to be on a show dealing with those issues. I was proud.
- The interesting thing about a lot of serialized television is that it's a blessing and curse.
- Smart writers really take their time in investing in backstories and characters. As a viewer, you have to invest in them and love them before you can chip away at what's going on more on a deeper level with secondary characters.
- I think that 'Gilmore Girls' did so many things well, and it was a very feminist show in a time when that wasn't really being portrayed at all.
- I think I can get a little passionate about things that I believe in and maybe that can be a little intense for people. And I think a lot of that stuff comes out of the need of wanting to belong, and being insecure and uncomfortable.
- It can be very thrilling being able to witness Viola Davis do her thing for hours and hours, but there are also no windows, and you're just in a room for fourteen hours trying to keep it together.
