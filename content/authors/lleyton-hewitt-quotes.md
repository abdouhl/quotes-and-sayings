- I'd much rather win in three or four sets than go the distance all the time; I seem to put everyone through the wringer quite a bit.
- Even when I was No. 1 in the world, I was taking it one match at a time. I never was a player to look too far ahead, the way draws can pan out.
- I have sometimes played my best Davis Cup matches away from home when you stay in the moment a bit more. But it is tough when half the crowd are spitting on you.
- I'm fortunate: I can play as long as I want to play. There's no coach or trainer who is going to say to me that I'm dropped or sacked, it's time to move on. I can play as long as I want to play.
- There are people who love you and people who hate you, but for me, more so, people only think they know me by how I act or perform on a tennis court.
- I'm more in that Rafa Nadal high-energy high-octane mold out there. I wear that emotion on the court. That's how I play my best tennis. People either like that or not. And I can't change that: that's who I am on a tennis court.
- I liked Pat Cash, and I loved Mats Wilander. I went to the Australian Open with my parents, and I used to watch Wilander being cheered on by the Swedish fans, and with his game style being like mine, I drew comparisons with him.
- When I was a kid in Adelaide, I dreamed of becoming No. 1 in the world, winning a grand slam and the Davis Cup for Australia.
- I don't have too much spare time, but I try to play games as much as possible. I played a little growing up, but I never played any tennis games before.
- I'm one injury away from hanging up the racket at any time.
- I was lucky enough to win the Davis Cup in my first year in 1999. I won my first slam at the U.S. Open in 2001 and became world No. 1 later that year. By the age of 20, I'd done it all.
- Tennis players go into a press conference, and almost every one of them is the same. We do very little differently on a day-to-day basis.
- I'm not to eager to play tennis in my spare time. I'm more interested in doing gym work and stuff like that. We have a lot of schools and courts around where I live, so if I really want to play, I don't need to go too far.
- When I go out to play, I still believe I'm as good as anyone out there. I don't have to prove anyone wrong. I know what I've done and how well I can play.
- Matches are won and lost so many times in the locker room.
- You always love playing in finals at any tournament. The grand slams and stuff like that are obviously the priorities but any titles go on your record.
- My video game character is a bit better looking than me, actually. I don't think he has to worry about his hair getting messed up.
- I'm not a guy who needs to read motivation books.
- I am two different people. What you see on the court is just natural for me. I wear my heart on my sleeve. I have always said 'C'mon' purely to fire myself up. Off the court, I am a lot shyer. I stick to my team and my family and people I trust.
- I've probably put up with more criticism than a lot of people out there. At the end of the day, you block out everything, especially with your personal life.
- Oh, I get pretty fired up on the court. I try to play with a lot of emotion, especially when I'm playing in front of a large crowd. I want to go out and do my best, and to do that, I have to play with the most energy possible.
