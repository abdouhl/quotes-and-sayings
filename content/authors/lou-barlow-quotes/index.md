- I went back and reread the Dinosaur chapter in 'Our Band Could Be Your Life,' and it was so depressing.
- Harmony Korine, the screenwriter, was really into my early work. I did a lot of stuff under the name Sentridoh and a lot of 4-track cassette stuff that he was into.

- I'm a huge Zombies fan.
- 'One Part Lullaby.' It was our big major-label record. People reference it quite a bit, but it did absolutely nothing. It's like the 'Kids' soundtrack. It did nothing. It didn't start anything for me.

- I have an aversion to taking care of my gear, a wayward manifestation of my punk ethos.
- Most of the times that I've written break-up songs, it's been different because I was always trying to get back to something: get back to a situation or talk my way or sing my way back into the relationship.
- Don Henley is real fallback for awfulness.
- I wrote 'Healthy Sick,' from our first LP, when I was 19. I'll happily play it till I'm 91 because it always feels good and truthful.
- Every show I play is like a little celebration of something in my life that has gone really well.

- I've always tried to make music for someone who's never heard anything I've ever done.
- Los Angeles was really beautiful, and California in general is a great place to live.
- I just write... I follow the melodies that I can't forget/the ones that pop up in my brain the most.

- I've never been good at playing live in front of people.
- It just takes me awhile to get comfortable in any situation.
- From when I young, a lot of the things I grappled with, with instruments, was how large they were. When someone places a large guitar in your lap, it's hard - I'd learned how to play a guitar when I was a kid, but I never really felt like I was in control.
- My experience with Dino Jr. proved that making new music was a worthwhile pursuit.
- Some of my songs are positive and stuff, but some are about staring down at the ground and obsessing about stupid things, and it is teenage in a way.
- I wrote a song for my sister's wedding.

- Maybe I can't write without painting myself into a corner first.
- When I first started writing songs, I did play with my fingers, and I had these kind of weird strums. There's, like, three or four strumming patterns that seemed kind of unique to me.
- 'Brace the Wave' is an acoustic-electric record recorded with electricity on analog-digital and digitally-analog equipment.
- It's cool to think about nursing, because a lot of people decide to go into it later in their lives. I could slip into school to be an LPN or an RN as a middle-aged man, and it wouldn't be unusual.
- I remember being inspired by this band Godflesh, actually. They were a really heavy metal band, really nihilistic.

- It's kind of crazy how music helped me overcome the anxieties that I have.
- I hear people telling me a lot that the production of that particular record - 'One Part Lullaby' - really influenced them. I'm like, 'What? We were dropped from the label after that!'
- NYC is a wonderland full of passionate music fans. Once I got over being intimidated by rock critics and finicky hipsters, I realized that NYC was a great place to play.
- Just from the beginning, I really liked playing around with tape recorders. And then, when I got into punk rock, I only really liked - the rawer it was, the more I was into it.
- Everybody talking about being afraid of being boring is boring. You have to go for the real substance of life after awhile.
- Simplicity is at the core of Sebadoh.
- My family is the epicenter of my life.
- If you make a strange, eccentric record - like the Velvet Underground's 'White Light/White Heat' - it takes on its own mood because it's less about a shrewd marketing plan; it's more about an individual emotion.
- I don't know what ontological means... I barely graduated high school, and I have never heard that word in conversation.
- Early on, I really liked the idea of being confrontational. I loved the idea of making songs that made people really uncomfortable.

- I look forward to so many things about going to Japan. The shows are early. It's great! They're really early, so it helps make dealing with jetlag a little easier.

- I have really severe tinnitus.
- At 12 or 13, I picked up a guitar because my mother made me learn how to play.
- Young bands are so angry. There are young bands that are so incredibly successful, getting incredible reviews, and they are totally angry.

- I prefer to read into other people's songs what I want to hear in them.
- Someone who's a really good engineer is someone who's a little bit smarter than you but who also listens to you and doesn't impose agendas.
- I keep the tantrums to a minimum because people don't want to see that.
- Sebadoh were always kind of the un-band. We never really lived in the same town.
- To be doing interviews in 2006 for a band I was kicked out of in 1989 - a band that I never thought I would play for again - in a way, it's weird.
- Within Istanbul, there's a ton of people who are totally hip - like, the hippest people you could ever meet.
- There are very few songs I really hate.
- I think musicians naturally gravitate toward music that sounds real.
- It's weird to say, but Sebadoh is kind of Dinosaur Jr. Jr. My two bandmates in the early Sebadoh era, Jason Lowenstein and Jeff Gaffney, were huge Dinosaur fans. They were very influenced by Dinosaur.
- I have to focus and keep things together as much as anyone with a real job... It's just that I know, from experience, that the more fun I have doing something that the more successful it will be.
- At nine or ten, I was playing guitar in music class in my elementary school in Jackson, Michigan. They had a guitar class, and I played with ten of my classmates, and we did a little guitar orchestra for a school music.
- That's what I've figured out over the years - the way I write makes people feel uncomfortable.
- I'm the haphazard engineer of my own music.
- Coming back to Dinosaur Jr. and actually writing songs for the band was really intense for me.
- One thing about when I came back into Dinosaur that was really cool was that pretty much anybody that J. was working with who had a long-term relationship with J. were people I really liked and that I actually may have already known.
- For me, it's hard to enter any situation with people where we're considering everyone equals, because I bring all of this massive baggage into anything that I do, preconceptions of my work. That's a lot for the people that I might be bringing along with me to bear.
- I like to collaborate with other people for studio recordings because I believe collaboration, in any form, makes music better.
- I'm realizing I need to be in close proximity to everyone I'm working with because that - I don't know - it keeps me engaged.
- I enjoy Dinosaur for what it is. It's a unique band that has a unique chemistry.
- After discovering the Ramones, I discovered really crude ways to multi-track by taking another cassette recorder and plugging that into the eight-track, playing it back, so that as I was recording with the mic in my guitar, I could have another cassette player I had recorded on feeding into the recording.
- J. makes me laugh. He's incredibly dry and has a pretty harsh sense of humor that I enjoy.
- When I was a teenager, my mom got me a really nice baritone ukulele.
- I'm the Folk Implosion's biggest fan.
- Some people play steel string beautifully, but I'm not exactly a world-class picker.
- I really don't have a method. I gravitate towards the organic/acoustic, but I still often complete songs musically before attempting to find the lyric.
- I like all the obnoxious Eagles stuff that just drives people crazy. I love 'Life In The Fast Lane' and 'Hotel California.'
- I'm fully aware, I've gotten terrible reviews my entire career. It's not a really big deal; it's something I can deal with.
- I've put out a lot of stuff that just confused and alienated people: a huge chunk of songs that were verbal and musical challenges to myself, thoughts I was keeping myself busy with, nothing I had any intention of anybody grasping onto.
- I'll figure something out by writing a song about it.
- I think people, just because of digital recording and how computers have become such an important part of our lives, I think the means to record music now is in more people's hands. It's a lot cheaper than it used to be.
- When you're in a band, it's kind of a big thing to be friends as well.
