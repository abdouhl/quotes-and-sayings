- Space is something that you have to define. Otherwise, it is like anxiety, which is too vague. A fear is something specific. I like claustrophobic spaces, because at least then you know your limits.
- I know that when I finish a drawing, my anxiety level decreases. The realistic drawings are a way of pinning down an idea. I don't want to loose it. With the abstract drawings, when I'm feeling loose, I can slip into the unconscious.
- I was raised a Catholic. But I am not religious. In my work, I am interested in real flesh and blood.
- I have kept a diary as long as I can remember, and drawings are really another kind of diary.
- My art is a form of restoration in terms of my feelings to myself and to others.
- To express your emotions, you have to be very loose and receptive. The unconscious will come to you if you have that gift that artists have. I only know if I'm inspired by the results.
- My childhood has never lost its mystery, and it has never lost its drama.
- I don't watch TV. I don't use a computer, a fax or a cellphone.
- Tell your own story, and you will be interesting.
- I was a 'runaway girl' from France who married an American and moved to New York City. I'm not sure I would have continued as an artist had I remained in Paris because of the family setup.
- Even though what I do does enter the market, it doesn't interest me. I am exclusively concerned with the formal qualities of my work. It is about the need and the right to self-expression.
- I have drawn my whole life. My parents were in the tapestry restoration business, and as a young girl, I would draw in the missing parts of the tapestry that needed to be rewoven.
- Look at it this way - a totem pole is just a decorated tree. My work is a confessional.
- When my mother died, I fell apart. My father wanted to control me. As a consequence, I ran away to America.
