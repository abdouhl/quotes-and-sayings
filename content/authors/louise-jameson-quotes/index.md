- They handled it very badly. It was disappointing and very humiliating. John York was very rude. He never consulted with me over what he said to the press.
- It definitely puts a strain on family life - I miss them like mad. Being a working mother I've been juggling house and career from day one. I want to hold out for telly for the second half of the year.
- I think I was first choice for the part. I don't know - that's what they always tell you anyway. I didn't have to do any audition for the part. Sam saw me in Dinner and the whole thing slipped into place.
- I found that a bit unfair. However, I did feel quite liberated when I left. I'm very grateful to the show - it revived a flagging career, but I'm glad to be away from it now.
- We were the victims of the new producer but what annoyed me was they told the press we were leaving before us.
- I'm quite grateful to the BBC. They helped me back onto the touring circuit.
- I'm hopefully touring with Colin Baker next year in Perfect Strangers. I have performed with Sylvia Simms in poetry and music evenings. I would love to do those for the rest of my career - they are so fun and witty.

- I've been on the road for four years. I won't recognise the place again, until I walk out on stage.
- It's a comedy thriller, brilliantly written and it's full of twists and turns at every page. When I was reading it I was desperate to get to the end to find out what happens, it really hooks you.
- Tom is the most eccentric person I have ever worked with. We get on very well and I am most impressed with how he can hold an audience in the palm of his hand.
- They can certainly expect to be very impressed with the technical aspects of the show, fooled and led up the garden path by the story and ultimately have a jolly good laugh!
- I never watch TV. I'm a Radio Four addict. I love listening to music too.
- It was all to do with the change of producer as well as political reasons I don't really comprehend.
- I would love to go back as Leela in this new series.
- They must have a feeling of do or die. It is such an overcrowded profession.
- I cannot understate the ability to handle classical texts such as Shakespeare.
- I only have three scenes and each is a turn and she gets progressively drunker. It's all terribly funny and its main challenge is that it's so far away from what I usually do.
- I think it's one of my favourite theatres ever, so quirky and wonderful and steeped in history. The space is wonderful and the acoustics are brilliant.
