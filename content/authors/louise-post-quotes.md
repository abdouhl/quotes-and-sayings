- My big brother listened to classic rock, and I grew up listening to a classic rock station called KSHE.
- I saw Styx in sixth grade. I loved Tommy Shaw. I got sneakers like him - he wore these tan Nikes.
- I actually had the pleasure of meeting David Bowie at his 50th birthday party in New York City. I handed him the cassette of 'Eight Arms to Hold You,' which I had just got an advance of that day. He very graciously thanked me and tucked it into his jacket pocket.
- I don't have anyone curbing my instincts, doing anything destructive to my self opinion.
