- I think my dream career would be to own my own production company and be able to write movies and star in them every once in awhile. Kind of like a Judd Apatow type of guy. That would be really fun.
- I'm gay.
- I like all types of music: pop, rock and country.
- I liked writing before I figured out I liked acting.
- My house is surrounded on three sides by cornfields.
- I think I'm just really lucky to have my Internet career last more than a few months.
- I would describe Fred Figglehorn to someone who hasn't heard of him as a really hyperactive, temper-throwing teenager who's stuck in the mentality of a 6-year-old.
- My worst habit is probably awkward laughing. I always awkward laugh, like when you're talking to someone and no one is saying anything, so I'll do an awkward laugh. I wish I didn't do that.
- I really like Jim Carrey.
- For as long as I can remember, I was always creating random characters.
- I'm definitely not as crazy as Fred!
- I'm an actor so I've been pursuing movies and I have some TV series ideas to pitch too.
- I really like the movie 'The Jerk' with Steve Martin.
- I love working with crews. Filming the 'Fred' movie, for example, was a blast. You get to be around so many creative, talented people all day, so it's a blast.
- When I started on YouTube, no one talked about getting famous on the Internet or getting discovered on YouTube. I didn't even know it was a possibility.
- One day I hope to meet Ellen Paige - she's an awesome actress.
- I've been on 'iCarly' and 'Hannah Montana.' And a few other things.
- I love The Onion videos, those are amazing.
- I think with the 'Fred' videos online, I prefer doing it by myself. I mean it's YouTube. You want to have all the creative control because that's the only place in the world where you get that.
- My strategy isn't just to get the biggest audience; it's to get a loyal audience.
- My dream job is definitely to be an actor/director/writer, all three.
- I think online, like on YouTube and stuff, people could pretty much say whatever they want. They have no filter in their brain, because no one knows who they are. They're totally anonymous, so they could say whatever they want. But when they're in person with me, they wouldn't say those things, because I can actually see who they are.
- I get a lot of ideas living in a huge family.
- I would trade places with Michael Bay when he was directing 'Transformers' because I'd get to meet Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox, and also see what it's like to direct a huge action movie. That'd be awesome.
- My favorite kind of fast food is definitely Mexican.
- I've just always been making videos. And then I just put them online and, luckily, they all took off.
- When you are a really iconic character, everyone thinks that's all you can do. It's nice to show people that I'm not a one-trick pony.
- I don't want to be just a performer.
- I was always really creative and making up stuff.
- I just made random videos with my mom's camera, before YouTube even started. It was just my family and friends in a few spoofs of scary movies and mock talk shows. And then I found out about YouTube so I posted a ton of those videos on there.
- I don't take myself too seriously.
- Obviously I had a different sense of humor when I was 13.
- Judd Apatow is amazing, and everything he does is so cool.
- I've gotten to meet so many talented people!
- I love Johnny Depp.
- No, I've never met someone who was mean to me. Like, a fan or a hater or something.
