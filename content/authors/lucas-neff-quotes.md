- I'm a young actor and I haven't learned everything there is about acting.
- Ninety percent of the time, I'm wearing imaginary people's clothing. I don't feel a huge pressure to go out and, like, hit the town, hit the boutiques.
- There's sort of a very symbiotic thing that happens on good TV shows with great writers, which is that they start to sort of embrace who the actors are and try to make the roles more specific to what they bring and what they can do.
- I really don't want to do anything that resembles stand-up comedy. But I will agree to say that I am doing it, and I will hope that people expect it to be that, so I can thwart those expectations.
- I'm a big John Steinbeck fan. Cormac McCarthy. I've always loved the stories of regular people. Mark Twain, too. When you look back at some of the epic writers of our country's history, very rarely do you find upper-class royalty. We seem to delve into the struggle of life and the labor of life much more frequently.
- That honeymoon phase is so much fun in real life, when you meet and discover somebody new and fall in love and chase them. The pursuit. And that climactic final moment of ultimate togetherness.
- Yes, I want kids. I don't know that I'll ever be ready. But, I'll certainly want them. I'll have them regardless of whether I am ready, I think. I just don't have a timeframe on it yet.
- To be honest, I can't wait to be a dad. I really hope that that's how the cookie crumbles for me.
- I'm certainly not a trained singer. The only place I could probably carry a tune is my shower.
- Working on 'Raising Hope' is a very hurry-up-and-wait activity, and I just always liked the idea of being as productive as I can be. I write because I don't just want that time to dissolve, where I'm sitting in a trailer staring blankly at the paintings of moccasins that came with the trailer.
- I think that's part of the fun of being an actor - you get to not be normal all of the time.
- It's ridiculous. My life's been a series of happy accidents.
