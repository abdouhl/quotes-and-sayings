- My approach to recording and all that is pretty organic. It just has to do with all the songs I wrote; go in and record them.

- I just broke up with my boyfriend, and I've been spending more time alone than I'd like.
- I feel a lot more comfortable being me these days. I'm constantly told that my work is good. A lot of fans and a lot of other artists say my songs and albums mean a lot to them. Isn't that what's important?

- I don't mean to complain. I wouldn't trade my life for anything.
- The man I lived with is a Christian, so I would talk to him about it. What would this person do in the Bible? What's the story around this person? Generally, when people talk about characters in the Bible, there's one thing they're known for, like Job.
- I certainly had my God-can-you-just-take-me-now-I've-just-had-it-I'm-checking-out-let-me-off-the-train-I'm-done kind of thing. But, you know, I would never actually do it. I just can't imagine what it would take to do that.
- People let their own hang-ups become the obstacles between them and personal happiness.
- Sade's stuff is real deceptive. She's got stuff about prostitutes, poverty and people on the streets.
- I've had trouble being in relationships and writing. This has been a real problem for me. I don't know if it's because I'm not free to fantasize or create these fantasy things about other people.

- I write first for myself as a therapeutic process, to get stuff out and to deal with it.

- There's so many other things to write about than unrequited love.
- I'm trying to learn how to tap into the power of my own being. I know it sounds corny.

- I'm not just a doormat. I'm not just being stepped on all over the place. If you look at the bulk of my material, it's about trying to find some strength through that.
