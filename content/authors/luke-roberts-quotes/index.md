- Conflict is good in a negotiation process... it's the clash of two ideas, which then, all being well, produces a third idea.
- I give everything far too much thought. If you think you know what you're doing, then you can kind of relax, and then you can improvise and play and just enjoy the day rather than be chasing the lines.
- I was quite intrigued by the idea of following the exploits of people who are often in the margins.
- Playing the greatest warrior in the seven kingdoms, that's absolutely no pressure. It didn't help, during the casting, the director kept saying, 'Remember, you're the most legendary swordsman ever.' I said, 'Great. I'll try and convey that in my four lines of dialogue.'
- I don't think I'm a particularly good negotiator.
- It's nice to sort of walk in and at least create the illusion that you are, or your character is, a well-rounded human being, a complete person. Especially when you're playing these impressive, high-functioning professionals. You feel like you have to come in sort of guns blazing.
- I was quite intrigued by the idea of following the exploits of people who are often in the margins. You see the negotiators, but it's usually the SWAT team or the tactical team that draw our eye.
- Playing the greatest warrior in the seven kingdoms, that's absolutely no pressure.
- I enjoy a good reasoned argument. I love the power of logic.
- What I've learned is that the clearer the creative vision, the clearer the idea for the show, the easier it is to rally your partners around what you're doing.
- 'Game of Thrones' has kind of got the Midas touch, certainly for the lead actors and those recurring guest stars. It's the show that can do no wrong because it's so well produced. My contribution is short, but I think, in my mind, it was sweet because it involved such elaborate scenes.
- I grew up on courtroom dramas, and I really love the feel of a dramatic thriller.
