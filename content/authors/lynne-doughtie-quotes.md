- I started playing golf when I was just out of college and starting my career with KPMG. I took a few lessons, and my husband has always loved to give me pointers - for better and for worse!

- Innovation demands risk-taking - which, in turn, entails redefining failure, stripping away its power to inhibit.

- The best leaders begin with an environment that embraces and rewards change and innovation.
- Too often, women are waiting for someone to recognise their great work and tap them on the shoulder and say, 'Here - this is the next thing we want you to do,' and that may happen. But I feel you need to take more ownership of telling your story, advocating for yourself. You can do it in a way that's positive and that your leaders will appreciate.
- At KPMG, we are intentional about leading with inclusion because we believe it strengthens our ability to make a tangible difference for our clients, our people, and society.
- The most resilient companies foster a pervasive culture of innovation at all levels of the organization - one that values risk-taking, embraces experimentation and considers failure an inevitable part of thinking boldly.
