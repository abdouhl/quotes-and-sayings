- I really do believe some people are naturally novelists and some people are short story writers. For me, when I was in middle school or high school, I started with novels.
- I've just always been fascinated by what our belief can do, and what happens when we misuse that.
- I've really loved steampunk for a long time, ever since 'Wild Wild West,' and it's always been a genre and an era that's fascinated me. But so often it's set in England, and that doesn't really resonate with me, or maybe it just seems a little overdone.
- I love those books like 'Gone with the Wind,' the huge, sweeping family sagas.
