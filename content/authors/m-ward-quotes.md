- I got this Christmas gift with the entire Beatles catalog. I had fun trying to duplicate what I was hearing on these records, only using the instruments I had at hand - an acoustic guitar, and that's all. It was endlessly amusing to me to try to imitate John Lennon and Paul McCartney's harmonies using the guitar.
- I get most of my inspiration from older records. Most of the records that I listen to were probably made before I was born, and I was born in the mid-'70s. I don't know why, exactly, I'm drawn to those sounds.
- One of the great things about music is that it has the capability of time travel - you smell a certain smell in the room and it takes you back to your childhood. I feel like music is able to do that, and it happens to me all the time.
- I don't like the way recording to digital sounds. Most of the time, when I'm recording to two-inch tape, I still have a romantic vision of how songs sounded coming out of the radio when I was younger, and how they sounded coming out of my little four-track cassette player.
- I love the sound of Elmore James, the sound early guitarists like him got just by using minimal means.
- I'm somebody who doesn't feel the need to be in the driver's seat all the time. I appreciate the perspective of being in the passenger's seat sometimes, and I feel fortunate for that because I've learned a lot from that perspective.
- My grandparents are from Mexico, so I grew up with great Mexican food.
- I'm somebody who gets a lot of inspiration from dreams.
- When I first started making music, it was learning other people's songs and putting them onto four-track. Like Beatles songs and stuff. When I started writing, I used the singing side of the production as a vehicle for melody and lyrical ideas.
- I get most of my inspiration from older records and older production styles, and that ends up rearing its head in the records that I make.
- I love the idea that I planned my career. I did not. It started out by getting invitations from artists that I really love and respect, to share a stage... I've been very lucky in that I haven't had to create a five-year plan. It's evolved.
- It's no fun for me to cover a song and produce it the exact same way as it already exists. When I hear that happening, I have to say, 'What's the point?'
- I wouldn't want to cover a Hank Williams song in a country-western way. It doesn't occur to me instinctually to re-create productions. I'm interested in re-creating songs. Putting different clothes on them.
- I do watch 'American Idol' sometimes. It's not really that pleasurable... I take that back. It is the epitome of a guilty pleasure. Sometimes there's some good singers on that show.
- I believe in working with songs that have personal value for me.
- The best live recordings capture elements of surprise onstage.
- I learned a long time ago that fame and money is not a ticket to happiness.
- I have a very strong belief in God.
- The South of France is one of my favorite places in the world.
- There's a relationship between music and spirituality and inspiration and to a certain extent improvisation that draws me in, because I don't totally understand it. I know that those relationships have been telling me, since I started making records, where to go. What to write down.
- I always prefer other people's interpretations over my own, so I'm not very quick to make explicit what exactly a song or record is about.
- I find that the time that goes by is actually your best friend when you are making a record. The passing of time gives you perspective on what you recorded and what you wrote. If something sounds good to you 12 months after you recorded it then chances are pretty good that there's something valuable about the part or the song.
- I don't really watch TV series because I don't want to get hooked on them and have them suck up all my time.
- I definitely don't see myself as much of a singer, because my upbringing is really based around the guitar, learning chord progressions and that sort of thing. So the singing aspect of what I do has been a secondary adventure.
- I've worked with just as many talented women as I have talented men, and I feel fortunate enough to have that great balance.
- It's a luxury to not have to just be performing with other people to have my music heard.
- Certain things you have to stumble on to. They can't be preprogrammed.
- When you work on a record for three years, it's a great sense of relief when it is finally out in the world. It just feels good.
