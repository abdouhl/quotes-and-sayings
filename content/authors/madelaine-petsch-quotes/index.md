- When I was younger, I used to be very afraid of doing anything out there with my makeup because I felt like my hair was such a big, strong piece.
- I want makeup to be more about freedom of expression. If I want to put on makeup and make myself look different, I can, but it's not a standard for every single day.
- We had South African accents. I was a vegan. I was raised without religion. I was just the weirdest kid in this small town, so I got made fun of a lot for it.
- I've been obsessed with sunglasses since the beginning of time.
- I eat clean and non-processed food, which helps me avoid feeling fatigued on long workdays.
- I'm afraid of open bodies of water. I was in a glass-bottomed boat that broke a long time ago, so I've always been kind of freaked out.
- I try to use my platform for things that I believe in and for things that would have helped me when I was younger. I try to keep everything really positive, which is why I made a YouTube channel, to integrate fans more into my life.
- I'm a firm believer in reading actual books.
- I grew up in a small town, I was the only redhead other than my brother.
- I'm a sunglasses aficionado if I do say so myself.
- It's hard for people to differentiate between a character they see on television and a person who plays the character.
- I'm super weird about my lips. I actually don't let makeup artists do my lipstick. I know my own lip line. I feel, even, they go too much over my lip line or too much under my lip line, and I don't want my lips to look strange on camera. I'm very particular about my lips.
- I have been obsessed with sunglasses for a very, very long time, so it was a natural fit for me to partner with Prive Revaux on my own collection.
- Just, always remember that it's important to be your own person, and as you grow up, you start appreciating the things that make you different.
- I love Halloween. I love Thanksgiving. I love Christmas. I love New Year's.
- I have a very strict skincare regimen that I do every day.
- I'm definitely a jeans girl.
- I am beyond honored to bring bisexuality in females to the screen more.
- I've never really wanted to do the bra top or booty shorts at festivals. I'd rather be cool, casual, and comfortable, and I like wearing outfits that I can also walk on the street with. In short, I don't really dress differently at festivals.
- I always have my Biore strips because they're fun. I always have Crest White Strips. I always have lip balm, and I'll bring concealer with me.
- If it's the right role, yes, of course, I would shave my head, but I don't know what role that would be. I'm still very attached to the hair.
- I think the first role I ever played was the Magic Carpet in 'Aladdin Jr.' I did a lot of tap dancing and not a lot of dialogue. But I loved it so much, and I loved the way people responded to the characters.
- I'd rather kiss my best friend than kiss some random guy.
- When I'm not on set, I'm either fresh-faced to give my skin some breathing time, or if I'm going out, I prefer more of a nude palette, usually a mauve lip and some light brown eyeshadow!
- Somebody told me a story where they met a celebrity when they were six years old, and the celebrity was really mean. They still remember that to this day. I never want some 22-year-old in ten years' time to say, 'I met Madelaine Petcsh, and it ruined my idea of celebrities,' so I'm always aware.
- I've always been a performer.
- I feel like I see so much online of people being cynical about never being able to find love, and it's become, like, cool. You don't need it by any means. You can live without it, and you can totally be self-independent and happy. But you can also be in a great relationship that's rewarding and loving and caring - and that exists.
- I think fans sometimes forget we also have lives outside of the show.
- My favorite way to be bold? Bouncing on a little highlighter with a damp Beautyblender. Especially under the brow bone, on the tip of the nose, and on the Cupid's bow!
- Sunglasses were my accessory of choice, and I always had an abundance of pairs.
- There's not one part of dialogue left behind on 'Riverdale.' You have to really be on your toes when you watch it.
- It's a lot of scrubbing of my lips every day. I make my own lip scrubs at home with coffee grinds and coconut oil.
- The people who are bullying you, they're insecure about who they are, and that's why they're bullying you. It never has to do with the person they're bullying. They desperately want to be loved and be accepted, and they go out of their way to make people feel unaccepted so that they're not alone.
- From the ages of 5 to 17, I was a competitive dancer. I even went to an arts high school and double-majored in dance and theatre.
- The impact that movies, film, and TV have on me - the way that they can toy with my emotions - is beautiful, and I've always wanted to do that for other people.
- I moved to L.A. straight out of graduating my arts high school and worked three jobs to afford living while taking acting classes and auditioning often.
- When you're in high school, there are so many bullies, and a lot of kids don't know why the bullies are being mean to them, so they blame it on themselves.
- I don't really wear eyeshadow. I'm pretty much always about my lashes and my lips, and then I let the rest of it do its own thing.

- For me, because my life is so public, I just like to be alone sometimes in my private house and enjoy my time.
- I love being on stage. I went into theater at five. I realized I really had something here.
- Comics are so one-dimensional, especially 'Archie.'
- I didn't have a lot of skin care products when I was a kid - my parents were very au naturale - and I think I was about 9 years old when my girlfriend told me she used Biore. I was like, 'Hmm, never heard of it.' So my mom took me to the store, and I picked out five different things and have been literally using it ever since.
- Knowing that you're not alone, and that people genuinely care, is really important.

- The fans are really sweet.
- I'm really happy to bring bisexuality to TV because you don't see that often on television, especially with women.

- I think it would be the biggest regret of mine - getting anything tattooed.
- I've always been somebody who would put together an outfit, and my go-to accessory would be a pair of sunglasses.
- I think, very often, little girls look at these teen television shows and think, 'I have to have a boyfriend because Blair Waldorf has a boyfriend, and she's always fighting over boys!'
- My favorite lip balm is, weirdly enough, just a little tube of Aquaphor. It's clear, and it will keep my lips glossy and perfect for hours.
- I'm just a nerd at heart, and I'm actually quite nice.
- When I first started doing carpets, my stylist and I would pose in the outfit in the mirror, and we decide what pose works with the outfit.
- I've learned not to let anyone affect my thoughts of myself. And I learned to love my red hair - it's my favorite thing!
- If you look at my carpet photos, I'm doing the exact same pose all the way down the carpet - like, I literally shuffle in that pose.
- The Deep Cleansing Pore Strips have been a staple product in my life for years. I don't pop blackheads. I don't touch my face. I like that this allows me to feel like I'm getting them out without grossing myself out.
- My dad is very environmentally conscious, and so I've always been close to nature.
- I used to never wear red.
- I don't like looking like a crazy person in my seat with a mask on, so I go into the airplane bathroom, put it on for a minute, and then I'll wash it off. Once I'm out of the bathroom, nobody even knows I did the mask, but my skin does!
- My mom gave me a rose quartz that I carry every day. It promotes self-love. Whenever I feel a little down, I just hold it and get some good energy.
- People enjoy photos of me by myself, and people also love to see how in love I am - it's a really beautiful thing to share with my fans, actually.
- I do a lot of dance classes in my spare time. I'm a dancer at heart.

- The first skincare product I ever got was nose strips. I was 8 years old, and I was like, 'I want to feel like a grown-up.'
- I don't triple cleanse if I'm not working. If I don't have a bunch of makeup on, I'll do one wash, and then I'm done.
- I start off by cleansing with the Biore Baking Soda Acne Cleansing Foam. I've tried so many different acne products and what I love about this one is it's very gentle and won't dry your skin out, all while keeping acne in check.
- I'm obsessed with everything Ryan Murphy does.
- My diet works for me because I can be very flexible about what I eat in a day.

- I'm very type-A.
- If you love what you're doing, it doesn't feel like work.
- I was the weirdest kid in this small town in Washington. I was the only person who was from somewhere else, so I think they just didn't understand it... They said I was a weirdo or that I didn't belong there. That was the hardest one when people said I didn't belong there.
- I was raised by vegan parents, and we ate out of my backyard garden for my whole life.

- Being vegan keeps my body fueled and running smoothly.
- I've been working on this career path of mine since I was three years old.
- My way of finding a book is to go on Emma Roberts' reading list.
- Every human being goes through a period of time in their life where they feel like they've lost who they are, and they're trying to figure out who they are and what they want to be.
- Whenever your agent and your manager are on the phone with you at the same time, you know they're either going to give you the most amazing news or the worst news.
- I think my generation is extremely cynical about love.
- I'm a working actress in Hollywood. You unfortunately don't get the pick of the litter when it comes to auditions and jobs.
- I feel like it's extremely rare to find a female who's bisexual and not either lesbian or straight on television shows.
- I'd love to challenge myself and play characters that overcome experiences like homelessness or abuse, because social justice is really important to me.
- My skin really reacts to stress.
- I love rose gold - it's just beautiful and classy and timeless.
- My mom put me into my first play at five at a local theater, and the next day after my first practice, I was like, 'This is what I want to do with my life.'
- I went through whole scene kid phase from when I was, like, 12 years old to 15. Black eyeliner - I got gauges, which I definitely regret now - and I had the world's worst haircut: it looked similar to a mullet with a rat's tail, essentially. It was not great.
- If I dyed my hair, my mother would actually disown me.
- Bisexuality is normal in our society.
- The pore strips have always been a staple for me. I like products where you can really feel like it's working, and of course you can see all your blackheads getting ripped out.
- I'll read tweets that people will tweet at me from time to time, but I try not to read too much about it, because you just never know what's going to end up influencing you.
- I'm a huge advocate of showing my relationship online because love does exist, and I think it's so important for our generation to know that love will win. No matter who you love, what you love, it will win.
- I had actually auditioned for a guest star role on 'Legends of Tomorrow,' and the show had the same casting director as 'Riverdale.'
- I love a good book. I'm not a club girl. I like hanging out and reading my books.
- I've been plant-based my whole life.
- I'm so happy I get to do 'Riverdale,' and I love the people I'm doing it with.
- I've got this weird thing where I wake up and put lotion all over, and when I go to sleep, I put lotion all over. I don't know if it's a good or bad thing, but it's shameless.
