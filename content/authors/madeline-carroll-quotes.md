- Gerard Butler is like a big kid; he's so nice.
- Acting is a tough business, but if you really want to do it, you should go full force.
- I have three brothers, and they'd torture me if I ever told them I liked a boy.
- Kids nowadays, I remember when I was in school, they were just rude, even to the teachers and stuff.
- I think girls from a young age know what they want, and boys kind of have to keep up and catch up to them. Even in kindergarten, girls are pretty much the ones that like the boy first and the boys are like, 'Oh, I want to play with my trucks.' They think it's not cool. I think girls are definitely more ahead than boys.
- My brothers and I love playing outside and climbing trees. We really love sports, too - I think football's probably my favorite.
