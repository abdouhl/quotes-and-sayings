- I used to just let people tell me what to do. I didn't really have a mind of my own, and I couldn't really say yes or no to things because I didn't really know what I wanted, but now I feel really confident in the fact that I can really be distinctive on what I want and how I want to do things.
- I like when my freckles show or when I do shoots and they accentuate them. It's such a compliment.

- I feel like the word 'influencer' is something that I've - I don't want to say struggled with, but I've kind of, like, expanded on that because I started as a musician. And my following came because of that, so it's always been, like, musician first and, I guess, social-media influencer second.

- I use the Tatcha Cleansing Oil. That's probably what I splurge on the most.
- 'Melodies' is just about having fun! The song's message is about being who you are and having a blast. I had such a great time recording it - I'm glad it's my first single.
- My weirdest scent association is probably Axe Body Spray, because every boy I know wears that stuff, and the smell is so specific! And the loud noise when you spray it! My little brother used to wear it, and the whole house would reek of it for days.

- I think Rihanna's awesome, and I love her music.
- I always said that I want to sell out Madison Square Garden before I turn 21.
- I'm so proud of 'As She Pleases.' It's a really personal record, and I put so much of myself into it that; it feels like I am sharing part of my soul with the world by releasing it.
- There was a time in my career when I felt like I wasn't being true to myself. I was being moulded into an artist I wasn't, and I knew I had to do everything I wanted to do. I think that's an issue a lot of women face, and men do have it easier in a lot of ways.
- I'm very much focused on my career.
- People would expect me to be this ditzy, bubblegum-pop girl. I was selling myself short.
- The worst thing any of us can do for our self-esteem is compare ourselves to others, and that's especially true of women.
- I have a very intrusive life, I guess you could say. I think that a lot of people know too much about me, truthfully.
- I think my fans inspire me a lot. They're a huge part of my career. I wouldn't be where I am without them, so I try to feed off what they're going through. I read their tweets and Instagrams.
- With everything I do, I'm 100 percent involved. I don't really let anyone just take over and hear what's going to go on. I like to have full creative control, pretty much, and really be involved with everything.
- I hope it never gets to that point that I'm gonna have people around me that are using me. I'm very good with noticing that.
- I stopped using make up wipes, and it made my skin so much better. They messed up my skin big time.
