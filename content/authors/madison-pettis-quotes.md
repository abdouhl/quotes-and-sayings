- I just like being on stage and making people happy.
- I've been acting since I was five, and I hope it's something I can do forever. I love it.
- I want people to realize that they can dream big.
- I love researching. That's one of my favorite parts about school.
- I like to work on T.V. because it's like a normal thing, and then I like to do movies when I'm on break or hiatus.
- When I was really little, my favorite book was 'The BFG'. I read it - my teacher in, like, first grade read it to us. I love that book.
- I think that T.V. shows are more like working at a home. You know you're going to the same place every day, working with the same people, the same cast and crew. You're in a dressing room instead of a trailer, so I think that that's more of a normal sort of lifestyle.
- I love going to football games and going to homecoming dances and just doing normal things.
- When I'm not shooting, I go to school every day. When I am shooting, I have tutors on set helping me.
- The thing I like to do most is shop.
