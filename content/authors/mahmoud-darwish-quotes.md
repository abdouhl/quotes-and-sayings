- The importance of poetry is not measured, finally, by what the poet says but by how he says it.
- When a writer declares that his first book is his best, that is bad. I progress successively from book to book.

- I never wanted children; maybe I'm afraid of responsibility.
- For the Arabs in Israel there is always a tension between nationality and identity.
- History laughs at both the victim and the aggressor.

- Sarcasm helps me overcome the harshness of the reality we live, eases the pain of scars and makes people smile.

- Some people ask, 'How do you attract the young and so many different people when your poetry is complicated and different?' I say, 'My accomplishment is that my readers trust me and accept my suggestions for change.'
- A person can only be born in one place. However, he may die several times elsewhere: in the exiles and prisons, and in a homeland transformed by the occupation and oppression into a nightmare.
- Poetry and beauty are always making peace. When you read something beautiful you find coexistence; it breaks walls down.
- I believe in the power of poetry, which gives me reasons to look ahead and identify a glint of light.
- Nothing, nothing justifies terrorism.
- I don't decide to represent anything except myself. But that self is full of collective memory.
- When I passed the age of 50, I learned how to control my emotions.
- The metaphor for Palestine is stronger than the Palestine of reality.
