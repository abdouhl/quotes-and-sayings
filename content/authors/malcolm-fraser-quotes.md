- Politicians today are not highly regarded... there seem to be people young and old and in the middle saying that they have never heard such wretched debates.
- We could try and establish a world in which the great and the powerful adhere to that international law which they require ordinary mortals to adhere to.

- Socialism is not a way of life. It is an unworkable formula which would apply to robots but not to men and women.
