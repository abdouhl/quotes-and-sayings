- You talked about national identity cards and the terrorism bill. We have made a government that has grown used to viewing us as subjects, has grown used to seeing its role as commanding us.
- Yes, many immigrants cherish the value of choice and opportunity and the value of education more than 7th or 8th generation Americans.
- It's insanity for a party that believes in freedom to allow some Republicans to seize an agenda that is totally alien to the agenda that was established in the election.
- Finally we are a nation with some conscience. It means alliances are extremely important when they're based on a national interest. We have to have the ability to sustain our presence within those alliances.

- I don't think the only place to fight for freedom is in the halls of Congress.
- We are a studying nation. Scholarship from science is important to the whole world and those people need to be able to be safe and secure in what they do.

- We are a communicating nation which needs access to space, access to the seas.
- The concept of minimum wage is crazy, if you really stop to think about it. If $8 an hour seems right, why not $20 an hour? If it's coming by order of the government, why stop at any level? Why not just say everyone should get what Gates gets?
