- What I do is I get the sheet music and I put it out for myself and then I use a visual tuner to go through each note individually. And every time I make a mistake, I start the song over again, so I use the muscle memory of intervals and then watching that tuner, and then a lot of repetition.
- I am not the performing type. I was the one who would cry, throw up or pass out.
- I was always a shy child and slightly hard of hearing, so music was my outlet.
- Music gives people the ability to dream, to leave their troubles behind for a moment and experience something beautiful. You create dreams and that's a beautiful thing!
- So I studied a lot with the balloon, and in learning how to sing with other musicians and keep in time - that's all by touch. A lot of that I feel in my body, and growing up with hearing I have pretty good muscle memory, and I was born with near perfect pitch.

- I really hope my music and my life can help encourage people not to give up.
- When I'm playing with my band, I designate different parts to feel different things. The bass pounds in your chest when you go to a concert. It almost replaces your heartbeat. Then the drums you feel on the floor.
- I miss the common things, the things that used to really annoy me, like an alarm clock. The sound of your zipper as your fly is being pulled up so that you know it actually is up. The sound of the door as it closes, to know that it's really shut.
- A long time ago I started talking into a balloon so I could feel myself talking, to practice judging volume, and compare it to other musicians.
- I was in Colorado for about 15 years but my family is all from Florida.
- I don't live my life based on fear of failure. I live my life with an understanding of failure and I'm embracing it, because every time I fail, I learn something new.
- I started writing music long after I lost my hearing.
- I really wanted to change the idea of what is possible and to show that 'deaf can' and what better place to do that than on national television?
- I am an ambassador for a nonprofit organization and I love being able to help people crush their barriers. I recently wrote a book. I want to do more with my life and help people do more with their lives, whatever that looks like.
- I didn't wake up one day and just couldn't hear. I woke up one day and realized I was having difficulty, and that I had overcompensated by lip reading, so that I didn't really understand how bad it was.
- My touring band, they're just brilliant, and all of them are learning ASL, so the wall of communication is breaking.
- I found my way back into music and realized that it's not that the music went away after losing my hearing, I just get the privilege of enjoying it and experiencing it differently.
- I grew up with hearing, so I have a really good understanding of music theory and the structure of music.

- TV has been so far outside my comfort zone.

- Losing my hearing was always my biggest fear, so what's the worst that can happen, sing the wrong notes? Who cares, it's not going to kill you.
- I work a lot with dynamics of how loud I'm talking, like speaking into balloons and then feeling the texture on my fingertips, and then I get used to the feeling on my throat.
- I don't need pity. I want to be looked at like a musician, because I am one. I happen to be deaf.
- Technology is improving to prevent musicians from losing their hearing while performing on stage... audience members losing their hearing from listening to loud music... people being able to experience music not just with their ears, but with touch or with through their eyes.
- It's just I do things differently and I want people to appreciate music for what it is, and not because of a story.

- I use the aid of technology while running through songs. Visual tuners and feeling the vibrations through the floor to keep time.

- The thing I love about music... you can close your eyes and be transported back to a memory or a dream or a feeling.
- I was a shy child. I had anxiety. I used to cry when I had to give a presentation.
- I made the mistake of pouring my entire identity into one single dream and convincing myself that I was not capable of anything else or creating any other dream.
- When I was losing my hearing, we had to buy hearing aids and they were incredibly expensive. It was a huge financial situation.
- You can feel the drums, and you can feel the bass. So, being able to feel the music through the floor, it makes me feel like I'm a part of the band and not just the only person in the room who doesn't really understand what's going on.
