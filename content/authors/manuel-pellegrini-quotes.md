- When I started to be a coach, I expected a lot - maybe too much - in terms of physical approach, tactics, and technique. There was too little emphasis on human relationships.
- I enjoy working, and I enjoy working every day - and it is for that reason that I don't so much like the idea of working with an international squad. To have every day on the pitch is important to me.

You have to speak a lot to the players, have to make them feel what you expect of them. Have to convince them. Therefore, it's very important for a coach to have a life outside football.
