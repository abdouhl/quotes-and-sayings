- I don't walk the mean streets.
- The 1890s was a decade when life began to change in urban America. Modern conveniences that we now take for granted came into use; women's roles became less restrictive; and San Francisco, a port city with influences from all over the world, was a lively place in which to reside.
- As I sat in a small room constructing what seemed to me awkward sentences and paragraphs, McCone was out having exciting adventures.
- It's very hard to get one publisher to accept an author going over to the other author's company to collaborate.
- We writers of series fiction tend to idealize ourselves in our characters, giving them attributes we wish we possessed and ever more interesting lives.
- About 10 years ago, in an effort to gain a better grasp on McCone's world, I took up the hobby of building fully electrified scale models: first of the legal cooperative where she started out, and then of her own brown-shingled cottage, a pursuit that the more tactful of my friends label unusual, and that the more blunt refer to as obsessive.
- We have a cottage on the Mendocino coast.
- Women in mystery fiction were largely confined to little old lady snoops - amateur sleuths - who are nurses, teachers, whatever.

- Anna Katherine Green wrote about a female inquiry agent, and there were a scattering of female investigators in the 1970s, authored by men, who just didn't ring true. So I thought, 'Well, there's an opening here for something.'
- I was never a good journalist, because I would make things up. A lot of people frowned on that, which is why I ended up in fiction.
