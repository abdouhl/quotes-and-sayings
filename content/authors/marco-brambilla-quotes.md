- Thematically, most of my work deals with transition, our culture's constant acceleration, and emotional connection and disconnection through technology.
- Usually, the energy in elevators is so awkward; I mean, I can't imagine the politics in the ones in the Conde Nast building.
- Just doing a project because it's an opportunity won't create meaning. As an artist, I need something to communicate.
- I never intended to become a commercial filmmaker in the first place. What I do requires time and experimentation. Commercial work is often not the best way to get the most innovative work, because it's about money and marketing. Although advertising is now embracing non-commercial people.
- Being able to make work - if it's on your terms, and it's a good fit with the people who are supporting it - can be a very interesting exercise. When it doesn't work is when an artist just connects with a brand, and they try to take advantage of each other.
- I like controversy. The more controversial it gets, the more interesting it is.
- I think that in a weird way, as technology gets more sophisticated, people have become less aware of it. It's become part of our day to day life. We're seeing large-scale projection mapping, like on buildings. There's video everywhere. It's much less noticeable that we're actually looking at technology.
- I love the idea of bringing my work to the general public, not just people who go to gallery openings.
- The art world has become the R&D department for so much fashion and music, so knock-offs are getting better and better.
- I think in America there's this free flow between fashion, art, architecture, music and design. In Europe, it's more segregated between those different disciplines, I think.
- For me, a lot of my work has dealt with what it means to be at the center of the universe and how alienating and kind of seductive it is. A lot of my work is very aggressive and very visual, but at the same time, it has a lot of tension in it and makes you kind of uncomfortable sometimes.
- I'm a huge cinemaphile. My interest in filmmaking came out of experimenting with different genres, and I wanted to go back to working in a way that was more personal, which, for me, was artwork. Commercials and films are more collaborative.
- Most of my work has no conventional narrative, so it's not essential to have a beginning and an end - your attention can flow in and out of the experience rather than having a set entry point.
- I'm very obsessed with the energy of New York and the idea of the way people behave in the city versus the way they behave in a natural environment.
- A lot of very popular mainstream artists are products of record companies and marketing companies, and any time anyone can stand outside of that, that's interesting.
