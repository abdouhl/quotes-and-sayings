- I think Mancini did a huge job. He did very well wherever he coached. He has been criticised, sure, but again, that's part of the picture.
- PSG have become one of the seven or eight best teams in the world. That is why there are so many players, some of which I don't know, who want to play for PSG.
- I don't care about who's playing alongside me. I'll try to do my best and then the coach will make his evaluations.
- I've never played with someone so strong and I probably never will again in my career. Zlatan is one of the best three in the world, it's an honour to have him at PSG.
- My debut was against England back in 2012.
- When great teams look at you it's always a source of pride. It means you're doing well and you're on the right track.
- Ancelotti spoke to everyone as a person, not just in a coach-to-player way. That doesn't happen often in football.
- No, I don't play for a side who have transitional seasons.
- When a player chooses to play for PSG he is also choosing a project that may one day win the Champions League. In this town, that will mean five times more than winning it at another club.
- It is a pleasure to be compared to a player like Xavi.
- My dream is to win here in Paris.
- When you are part of a big project, that makes you feel big.
- Compared to Pirlo, I can't even throw a ball. I like to learn from him about what to do ahead of time.
- We have to find the strength to pick ourselves up. We have to be men.
- Anyone who comes to Paris Saint-Germain knows there will be a lot of pressure, and that comes with having big targets.
- I prefer to play with pressure rather than being relaxed.
- Serie A is a great league, just like in Spain or England, so if one day if I were to leave Paris, I would evaluate and see what to do.
- I want to play differently because I think I have got something, something different, and if one day I let a goal happen that should not have happened then, well, I will take the responsibility for that but I will also continue to play that way.
- Back when I played for Pescara I was sought after by a lot of clubs, but if I had ended up at Juventus I doubt they would have given me the same space that I have with PSG.
- The important thing is to give everything and to have no regrets.
- All lessons are useful.

- My dream five-a-side team will be: me, Messi, Ibrahimovic, Maxwell and Thiago Motta.
- We Italians are very superstitious so before the game we prefer to predict that the opponents will win.

- The Premier League is really strong but I'm not a player who likes new challenges just for the sake of it.
- Apart from the talent God has given Mbappe, he is a very professional boy, he always plays with the desire to score whether in training or in a match. He listens a lot. He already has, I think, everything needed in football. He knows how to stay focused, how to get into the game.
- Some of the yellow cards I get are for tactical fouls, which is fair enough, but I don't like the others - the ones for protesting.
- I prefer entertaining football but having a personality like Costa in your team is always good. He uses warfare to win the games but I know him, he's a good guy who transforms when he comes on the pitch.
- Ancelotti immediately understood me and put me in the right situation to adapt quickly. I was 18 and, at that age, it is difficult. He helped me a lot off the field, too. He advised me on how to behave. You can say he was a father to me in the footballing world.
- The Champions League is made up of cycles and experience to be acquired.
- I had the pleasure of getting to know David Beckham, an icon of football and beyond that. He's a great person, but I had no idea he was such a shy guy. Sometimes when you speak to him he blushes. It's very strange, he's famous around the world but in private he is very shy.
- I have played against greats, like Ronaldo and Hazard. But I love watching Messi's touch of the ball, his style.
- If I was to leave Paris one day, I would have no problem going to Serie A.

- Clearly I am pleased to be of interest to a club like Juve, but I repeat I am very happy in Paris.
- I'm fine in Paris. I am well set and I intend to stay there as long as possible.
- Often, when a player loses his starting place, he is a little left out.
- Results are paramount, and when you don't win, it's easier to criticise the manager than the whole team.
- When I was little, I loved Alessandro Del Piero, who made history with Juventus and the national team. And growing up, once I took to the pitch, I looked closely at what Andrea Pirlo was doing.
- I know how rewarding it is to play for the national team. It's the dream of every player.
- Juve are not a club who sell their champions.
- Training under Conte is strange - there's a lot of tactical work. In that respect, though, he is one of the best coaches I have ever had.
- Our supreme goal is to win the Champions League, that's what we're here for.
- On the outside, maybe trophies are minimised, but, for us, these are true goals.
- I never came to PSG and told them 'I want to leave.'
- I have known a lot of coaches, but Tuchel gets to get into the players' heads quickly. You want to listen to him. And give 100% because he gives himself thoroughly.
- Every year rumours seem to emerge that I am going to Juventus, so this story has been going for a long time.
- Each manager has a different way of doing things with his players, of making them understand things.
- Xavi is the best midfielder in history.
- I think it's normal for all the big players to come to the PSG because here there's a big project like few in Europe and a really competitive team, and then the city is incredible.

- We have to avoid putting too much pressure on ourselves.
- It's nice when a big team like Real Madrid is interested in you, but I decided to win with Paris.
- Matuidi is a midfielder of international importance that has everything and gives it all. He is physically strong, intelligent, always progressive with the ball.
- Coming to training with a straight face, it does not work.
- A lot of the time I am told to clear the ball, kick it out, 'degager le ballon' they shout, but I can't do that and if I have to do that then it feels like a defeat for me. I don't know how to do it. I never get rid of the ball that way and when I am watching TV and I see players who do get rid of the ball then I don't accept it.
- I made the best choice coming to PSG, and after almost two years I have no doubts about it. I've been very well received, I'm playing and wearing the jersey of a side that can win it all.
