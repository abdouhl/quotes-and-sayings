- I've never bought into any sort of hard and fast, this-box/that-box characterization. People are individuals. Yes, they may be expected to be a particular way. But that doesn't mean they're going to be that way.
- Popular art is the dream of society; it does not examine itself.
- The genesis of a poem for me is usually a cluster of words. The only good metaphor I can think of is a scientific one: dipping a thread into a supersaturated solution to induce crystal formation. I don't think I solve problems in my poetry; I think I uncover the problems.
- Science fiction is filled with Martians and space travel to other planets, and things like that.
- Our problem right now is that we're so specialized that if the lights go out, there are a huge number of people who are not going to know what to do. But within every dystopia there's a little utopia.
- '1984' is not a wonder tale. Not only could it happen, but it has happened, but under different names.
- I don't think the relationship between novels and realities are one to one. Of course novels play different roles. It's essentially just a long narrative form. What you use that long narrative form for can be very different.
- Writers and books are cheap dates, especially when you compare the cost of a book with a ticket to the opera - or an NHL game.
- I think every age lives in a blend of technology so there's always older ones mixed in with newer ones, and when the new technology goes down, the immediate fallback position is either that technology just before that or one several technologies back.
- People use technology only to mean digital technology. Technology is actually everything we make.
- I hate to tell you this, but you will never actually go to a galaxy far, far away and encounter Darth Vader. That's science fiction; it isn't going to happen.
- There would be no Sherlock Holmes if it were not for serial publication.
- Fiction is not necessarily about what you know, it's about how you feel. That is the truth about fiction, and the other truth is that all science is a tool, and we use our tools not to actualise what we know, but to implement how we feel.
- Vampires get the joy of flying around and living forever, werewolves get the joy of animal spirits. But zombies, they're not rich, or aristocratic, they shuffle around. They're a group phenomenon, they're not very fast, they're quite sickly. So what's the pleasure of being one?
- Gardening is not a rational act.
- The story as told in The Odyssey doesn't hold water. There are too many inconsistencies.
- Victorian literature was my subject at Harvard.
- Science and fiction both begin with similar questions: What if? Why? How does it all work? But they focus on different areas of life on earth.
- If you're waiting for the perfect moment, you'll never write a thing because it will never arrive. I have no routine. I have no foolproof anything. There's nothing foolproof.
- Science fiction, to me, has not only things that wouldn't happen, but other planets.
- I'm not interested in cutting the feet off my characters or stretching them to make them fit my certain political view.
- Within one's own family, money is not the measure of things, unless the person is an absolute Scrooge. Only the most extreme kind of monster would put a price on everything.
- Some bioengineering is good, especially if it results in plants that are more drought-resistant or perennial food crops.
- I grew up in the golden age of Flash Gordon and sci-fi.
- I hope that people will finally come to realize that there is only one 'race' - the human race - and that we are all members of it.
- The object is very clear in the fight against racism; you have reasons why you're opposed to it. But when you're writing a novel, you don't want the reader to come out of it voting yes or no to some question. Life is more complicated than that.
- The darkness is really out there. It's not something that's in my head, just. It's in my work because it's in the world.
- Another belief of mine; that everyone else my age is an adult, whereas I am merely in disguise.
- I began writing at the age of 5, but there was a dark period between the ages of 8 and 16 when I didn't write. I started again at 16 and have no idea why, but it was suddenly the only thing I wanted to do.
- You need a certain amount of nerve to be a writer.
- War is what happens when language fails.
- A divorce is like an amputation: you survive it, but there's less of you.
- You hear doom and gloom about the Internet ruining young people's command of English - that's nonsense.
- I have a big following among the biogeeks of this world. Nobody ever puts them in books.
- I don't think of poetry as a 'rational' activity but as an aural one. My poems usually begin with words or phrases which appeal more because of their sound than their meaning, and the movement and phrasing of a poem are very important to me.
- I'm a person of whim, and easily distracted. I don't like multitasking. When I'm doing one thing, I like to do just that thing.
- You can examine the whole 19th century from the point of view of who would have maxed out their credit cards. Emma Bovary would have maxed hers out. No question. Mr. Scrooge would not have. He would have snipped his up.
- If it's all instruction, you get annoyed with it and bored, and you stop reading. If it's all entertainment, you read it quite quickly, your heart going pitty-pat, pitty-pat. But when you finish, that's it. You're not going to think about it much afterward, apart from the odd nightmare. You're not going to read that book again.
- You could tell 'The Handmaid's Tale' from a male point of view. People have mistakenly felt that the women are oppressed, but power tends to organise itself in a pyramid. I could pick a male narrator from somewhere in that pyramid. It would interesting.
- An eye for an eye only leads to more blindness.
- A ratio of failures is built into the process of writing. The wastebasket has evolved for a reason.
- Social media is called social media for a reason. It lends itself to sharing rather than horn-tooting.
- You're never going to kill storytelling, because it's built into the human plan. We come with it.
- As an artist your first loyalty is to your art. Unless this is the case, you're going to be a second-rate artist.
- There's a difference between describing and evoking something. You can describe something and be quite clinical about it. To evoke it, you call it up in the reader. That's what writers do when they're good.
- The beginning of Canadian cultural nationalism was not 'Am I really that oppressed?' but 'Am I really that boring?'
- I tend to feel if people say they're going to do something, they will, if given the chance.
- If I waited for perfection... I would never write a word.
- Younger people have greatest fears. Why is that? Because they don't know the plot. They don't know their own individual plot... they don't know what's going to happen to them.
- I grew up with the biologists. I know how they think.
- Canada was built on dead beavers.
- I'm a strict, strict agnostic. It's very different from a casual, 'I don't know.' It's that you cannot present as knowledge something that is not knowledge. You can present it as faith, you can present it as belief, but you can't present it as fact.
- I got into trouble a while ago for saying that I thought the internet led to increased literacy - people scolded me about the shocking grammar to be found online - but I was talking about fundamentals: quite simply, you can't use the net unless you can read.
- Foreignness is all around. Only in the heart of the heart of the country, namely the heart of the United States, can you avoid such a thing. In the center of an empire, you can think of your experience as universal. Outside the empire or on the fringes of the empire, you cannot.
- Time is compressed like the fist I close on my knee... I hold inside it the clues and solutions and the power for what I must do now.
- I didn't go to school for a full year until I was 12. In the summer I was a wild child in the woods, with no shoes, and in the fall it was back to the city, shoe shops and school.
- If you're put on a pedestal, you're supposed to behave yourself like a pedestal type of person. Pedestals actually have a limited circumference. Not much room to move around.
- If social stability goes pear-shaped, you have a choice between anarchy and dictatorship. Most people will opt for more security, even if they have to give up some personal freedom.
- We still think of a powerful man as a born leader and a powerful woman as an anomaly.
- When things are really dismal, you can laugh, or you can cave in completely.
- Religions in general have to rediscover their roots. In Hinduism and the Koran, animals are described as equals. If you walk into a cathedral and look at the decorations of early Christianity, there are vines, animals, creatures and birds thriving all over the stonework.
- When you're writing a novel, you don't want the reader to come out of it voting yes or no to some question. Life is more complicated than that. Reality simply consists of different points of view.
- You quickly find, when you are a hand-reader as I am, that nothing interests people so much as themselves.
- Reality simply consists of different points of view.
- Please don't make the mistake of thinking that 'Oryx and Crake' is anti-science. Science is a way of knowing, and a tool. Like all ways of knowing and tools, it can be turned to bad uses. And it can be bought and sold, and it often is. But it is not in itself bad. Like electricity, it's neutral.
- Speculative fiction encompasses that which we could actually do. Sci-fi is that which we're probably not going to see.
- Never pray for justice, because you might get some.
- There may not be one Truth - there may be several truths - but saying that is not to say that reality doesn't exist.
- Once upon a time, novelists of the 19th century, such as Charles Dickens, published in serial form.

- The answers you get from literature depend on the questions you pose.
- The myth that everyone once read great literature is just a myth.
- If you feel that there's the author and then the character, then the book is not working. People have a habit of identifying the author with the narrator, and you can't, obviously, be all of the narrators in all of your books, or else you'd be a very strange person indeed.
- You will always have partial points of view, and you'll always have the story behind the story that hasn't come out yet. And any form of journalism you're involved with is going to be up against a biased viewpoint and partial knowledge.
- Like many modern poets, I tend to conceal rhymes by placing them in the middle of lines, and to avoid immediate alliteration and assonance in favor of echoes placed later in the poems.
- If one of the arguments against eating meat is to do with cruelty and animal intelligence, then lab meat avoids that. There's also the environmental argument for it.
- If I were going to convert to any religion I would probably choose Catholicism because it at least has female saints and the Virgin Mary.
- I've never understood why people consider youth a time of freedom and joy. It's probably because they have forgotten their own.
- Canada is a balloon-puncturing country. You are not really allowed to be an icon unless you also make an idiot of yourself.
- Optimism means better than reality; pessimism means worse than reality. I'm a realist.
- Little girls are cute and small only to adults. To one another they are not cute. They are life-sized.
- If I pick up a book with vampires on the cover, I want there to be vampires. If I pick up a book with spaceships on the cover, I want spaceships. If I see one with dragons, I want there to be dragons inside the book. Proper labeling. Ethical labeling.
- Science never makes things that do not have to do with what we feel, by which I mean what we want and what we fear.
- I spent much of my childhood in northern Quebec, and often there was no radio, no television - there wasn't a lot to entertain us. When it rained, I stayed inside reading, writing, drawing.
- I grew up in the north woods of Canada. You had to know certain things about survival. Wilderness survival courses weren't very formalized when I was growing up, but I was taught certain things about what to do if I got lost in the woods.
- For years I wanted to be older, and now I am.
- If I pick up a book with spaceships on the cover, I want spaceships. If I see one with dragons, I want there to be dragons inside the book. Proper labeling. Ethical labeling. I don't want to open up my cornflakes and find that they're full of pebbles... You need to respect the reader enough not to call it something it isn't.
- The society in 'The Handmaid's Tale' is a throwback to the early Puritans whom I studied extensively at Harvard under Perry Miller, to whom the book is dedicated.
- When I am writing fiction, I believe I am much better organized, more methodical - one has to be when writing a novel. Writing poetry is a state of free float.
- I'm bad at picking heroes.
- Every utopia - let's just stick with the literary ones - faces the same problem: What do you do with the people who don't fit in?
- Every aspect of human technology has a dark side, including the bow and arrow.
- I was once a graduate student in Victorian literature, and I believe as the Victorian novelists did, that a novel isn't simply a vehicle for private expression, but that it also exists for social examination. I firmly believe this.
- Communications technology changes possibilities for communication, but that doesn't mean it changes the inherited structure of the brain. So you may think that you're addicted to online reading, but as soon as it isn't available anymore, your brain will pretty immediately adjust to other forms of reading. It's a habit like all habits.
- Genres aren't closed boxes. Stuff flows back and forth across the borders all the time.
- I was warped early by Ray Bradbury and Edgar Allan Poe. I was very fond of Franz Kafka.
- Reading and writing are connected. I learned to read very early so I could read the comics, which I then started to draw.
- Debt is part of the human condition. Civilization is based on exchanges - on gifts, trades, loans - and the revenges and insults that come when they are not paid back.
- Their mothers had finally caught up to them and been proven right. There were consequences after all but they were the consequences to things you didn't even know you'd done.
- This above all, to refuse to be a victim.
- Some people mistakenly think nature is very nice and benevolent and never betrays.
- The Eskimos had fifty-two names for snow because it was important to them: there ought to be as many for love.
- I know that some books and some writers, you can pretty much draw a square around it and say, 'Nobody under 40,' or 'Nobody under 25.' With my books, it always has been, and continues to be, spread right across the board, and I think the operative term is 'reader.'
- Science is a tool, and we invent tools to do things we want. It's a question of how those tools are used by people.
- The threat to the planet is us. It's actually not a threat to the planet - it's a threat to us.
- I'm the only person you've ever met who has read Longfellow.
- The thing about delirium is you think it's great, but it actually isn't.
- I have been known to buy e-versions of my books because I was in a hotel room and I needed one right away to look up something in it; very handy for that - you can have it just the next minute; you can press the button and just have it.
- Reading and writing, like everything else, improve with practice. And, of course, if there are no young readers and writers, there will shortly be no older ones. Literacy will be dead, and democracy - which many believe goes hand in hand with it - will be dead as well.
- Storytelling is a very old human skill that gives us an evolutionary advantage. If you can tell young people how you kill an emu, acted out in song or dance, or that Uncle George was eaten by a croc over there, don't go there to swim, then those young people don't have to find out by trial and error.
- In the spring, at the end of the day, you should smell like dirt.
- I learned to read very early so I could read the comics, which I then started to draw.
- We shouldn't be saying 'Save the planet'; we should be saying: 'Save viable conditions in which people can live.' That's what we're dealing with here.
- When I was 16, I started publishing all kinds of things in school magazines.
- I was born in the Ottawa General Hospital right after the Gray Cup Football Game in 1939. Six months later, I was backpacked into the Quebec bush. I grew up in and out of the bush, in and out of Ottawa, Sault Ste. Marie and Toronto.
- Myths can't be translated as they did in their ancient soil. We can only find our own meaning in our own time.
- My brother and I were both good at science, and we were both good at English literature. Either one of us could have gone either way.
- I'm from the generation that had the boys' door and the girls' door when you went to school, and you got in big trouble if you went in the wrong one.
- Sooner or later, I hate to break it to you, you're gonna die, so how do you fill in the space between here and there? It's yours. Seize your space.
- Some of our earliest writing, in cuneiform, was about who owes what.
- Our generation in the west was lucky: we had readymade gateways. We had books, paper, teachers, schools and libraries. But many in the world lack these luxuries. How do you practice without such tryout venues?
- All fiction is about people, unless it's about rabbits pretending to be people. It's all essentially characters in action, which means characters moving through time and changes taking place, and that's what we call 'the plot'.
- Before the Civil War, Canada was at the top of the underground railroad. If you made it into Canada, you were safe unless someone came and hauled you back. That was also true during the Vietnam War for draft resisters.
- A voice is a human gift; it should be cherished and used, to utter fully human speech as possible. Powerlessness and silence go together.
- I particularly like Twitter, because it's short and can be very funny and informative. It's a little bit like having your own radio program.
- There is good and mediocre writing within every genre.
- As soon as you have a language that has a past tense and a future tense you're going to say, 'Where did we come from, what happens next?' The ability to remember the past helps us plan the future.
- Heroes need monsters to establish their heroic credentials. You need something scary to overcome.
- A reader can never tell if it's a real thimble or an imaginary thimble, because by the time you're reading it, they're the same. It's a thimble. It's in the book.
- If the national mental illness of the United States is megalomania, that of Canada is paranoid schizophrenia.
- We have to rethink our whole energy approach, which is hard to do because we're so dependent on oil, not just for fuel but also plastic. If plastic vanished, there would be total chaos. We have to think quite carefully about using oil and its derivatives, because it's not going to be around forever.
- Because I am a mother, I am capable of being shocked: as I never was when I was not one.
