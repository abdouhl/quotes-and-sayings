- Why can't all different types of women be considered beautiful? Why can't we can't we all be considered possible love interests?

It's always too filthy. I'm dying to sell out. But I love doing comedy, I love touring, and I think I would do everything for free.

- It's important to feel beautiful; it's political to feel beautiful.
- Politics has less to do with where you live than where your heart is.

- I am star-struck but also I've known a lot of people for a long time. Like I'm super star-struck by Grant Lee Phillips and Jon Brion but I've known them for 17 years. So it's kinda like weird to be star-struck still, but I still am!

- Maybe I wanted to hear it so badly that my ears betrayed my mind in order to secure my heart.
- I do love the road, because for me, the road is very comfortable, and it's very much what I've always wanted to do. It's one of the most appealing things about comedy for me, so I do really have an affection for it.
- I punished myself and avoided my reflection in mirrors and any windows. I would see myself reflected back, and I would look away, trying to pretend I didn't exist, because I hated myself so much.
- When it comes to children, my mom doesn't believe in borders. She loves all children, and that's a good example of mothering the world. I need to do that, but before I can, I need to get over my fear of kids in the first place.
- If public figures came out of the closet, then the LGBT kids who saw them on TV would feel safe before they even knew why they felt dangerous. Maybe if enough people came out of the closet, gay kids would never feel dangerous. Maybe we could have a world where we could all just live. We may not all agree, but why can't we just all live?
- The best tattooists are in San Francisco, and they're kind of like my family now. I'm always excited to come back to San Francisco.
