- From the time I was 20 and people would say, 'Chicks with Picks,' I hated it. It's not a genre, it's a gender.
- For a long time, I was very naive and very trusting. I Just didn't think anyone would want to do anything to harm me, but I learned through trial and error that that's not the case.

I'd stay by myself on the North Carolina coast for a couple of weeks, with my dog and my gun, and my mom would be terrified. I told her, if I stay home, a lamp could fall on my head. You can't spend your whole life inside because you're scared.

- I worried so long that I would sing to empty bars my whole life. I was singing my guts out; there would be five people into it.
- A lot of people like mainstream country because they're not given another option of country music to like that's modern.
- I taught and studied dance in college, and for over a decade, I thought that would be my career: tap dancer, ballet dancer, modern dancer. I still find myself doing some tumbling or interpretive dancing in the grocery store every now and then.
- I think it's okay to talk about grief and sorrow. Especially for women, when you lose a child or have a miscarriage, it's good to talk about it, as a lot of people don't want you to speak about those things. It makes people sad, but sometimes you've got to.

- Women get labeled 'bossy' when it's like, 'Maybe I'm a leader. Maybe I just know what I want.'
- I know so many girls that have felt like they've been taken advantage of. Not only in the music business, but in every single career out there.
