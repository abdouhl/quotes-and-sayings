- Nobody is going to tell me that I can't do three games in a week. No one is going to tell me that I can't do it well. I'm going to work really hard at it. I get bored if I don't have 10,000 things on my plate.
- When we launched the SEC Network, I think I cried.
- I didn't want to just be an analyst for women's basketball and volleyball. I didn't just want to be a sideline reporter. I didn't just want to be a host. I wanted to be someone that my producers or coordinating producers could call on me for any event, any subject matter or any role.

- For me, I want everything to be easy, breezy, and everyone to have a blast. And I feel like those are all the things that happened regardless of whether or not it was the perfect color scheme or the flower arrangement was this and that.
- I think it's so important as a woman, and especially as a minority, to lift as you climb. So having people shadow you or mentoring people - that's important to me.
- It's just been this incredible steady climb, but I've seen a company that believes in me and has let me make mistakes, has let me grow and evolve and try and find new and inventive ways to use me. I feel like I came up through the farm system.
- From the beginning, I knew I wanted a beach wedding so I'm thankful looking back that this is how everything turned out.
- You always knew there was love, but marriage adds this layer of security. We're going through our life together, forever.
