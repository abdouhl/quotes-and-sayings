- I like to keep my wheels on the ground.
- The Marianne Vos Route goes through the seven villages of Aalburg, where I grew up, and celebrates my World and Olympic titles with a number of benches along the route, where you can stop and rest your legs. You'll see the white windmill in Meeuwen and, in Babylonienbroek, a statue of the silver bike I rode to celebrate my Olympic track win.
- I want to be motivational and inspirational for everybody: my big aim is more women on bicycles.
- Thanks to the Tour de France, riding the Champs-Elysees has a great cycling history.
- I'm kind of well-known in Holland, which is nice. But in Holland, we're down to earth; there are no paparazzi in my garden and no autograph hunters at the door. We have 'Strictly Come Dancing,' but I've not been asked.
- I'm from Holland, and I'm used to rain.
- I like to sit down, relax, have a cup of coffee on the terrace and read a book. I like to travel the world - and I'm lucky to see so much through cycling.
- My big objective this season is to win three gold medals at the Olympics, in the road race, the time trial and the points race.
- There can be crowd issues everywhere in cycling. But it's a good thing for cycling that it's so accessible for spectators. That's why it's so popular - because fans can get close to the road and the race. But you also have to be aware of the dangers.
