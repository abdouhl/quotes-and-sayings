- We are constantly nothing but a bunch of energy being processed. Into this whirlpool, the more complex the system, the more energy it requires to hold it together. Therefore, the more complex - the scientists call it 'coherent' - the more fluctuations are possible.
- Fear is a question: What are you afraid of, and why? Just as the seed of health is in illness, because illness contains information, your fears are a treasure house of self-knowledge if you explore them.
- Yes, an individual could be electronically stimulated to fear, anger, or euphoria from a distance. However, the procedure is complicated, not always accurate, and far too tedious and expensive as a method for taking over control of the world.
- Evolution happens in jumps, very rapidly.
- It is a dark, unspoken truth that the powerful - the 'ruling class' - make up the rules as they go along.
- The ferment and viability in any society is directly proportionate to the number of people actively living their ideas. This is not positive thinking - it is positive action: the spirit of experiment.
- Despair is a cop-out, the ultimate abdication of all responsibility, in which people feel justified in their feelings of impotence. But if, on the other hand, you feel that your work in the world does make a difference and that you do have the power to change things, the nay-sayers will turn a deaf ear.

- The New Age, I think, is a term that is well laid to rest.
- 'Aquarian Conspiracy' is the term I have coined for the network of people working for social transformation based on personal inner change. Such a notion is not at all alien to the American milieu.
- Victory doesn't lie in taming our nature but in progressively discovering and revealing more of it.
- The paradigm of the 'Aquarian Conspiracy' sees humankind embedded in nature. It promotes the autonomous individual in a decentralized society... The new perspective respects the ecology of everything: birth, death, learning, health, family, work, science, spirituality, the arts, the community, relationships, politics.
- Most of us are having to invent, discover, and create the next steps of our lives without a light, a map, or a relevant tradition.
- We are going to see a burst of creativity that will make the Renaissance pale in comparison.
- Although focusing is best pursued as a deliberate strategy over a period of time, it is also valuable as a kind of psychological first-aid, as useful to a distressed, 'stuck' person as a tourniquet to an accident victim.
- The best artists are scientific, and the best scientists are artistic.
- In the most important areas, as individuals and countries, we don't change our behavior until we have our backs to the wall.
- If you start thinking of stress as not a bad thing but inevitable, resulting in change that itself leads to transformation that leads to sharp and radical changes... it can be a very useful way of thinking.
- Over the years your bodies become walking autobiographies, telling friends and strangers alike of the minor and major stresses of your lives.
- We should not become so ashamed of the disappointments and travesties of democracy that we become ashamed of the idea itself. It is the outer reflection of our self-acceptance.
- Achievers have an enabling attitude, realism, and a conviction that they themselves were the laboratory of innovation. Their ability to change themselves is central to their success. They have learned to conserve their energy by minimizing the time spent in regret or complaint. Every event is a lesson to them, every person a teacher.

- People are seeking more power in the individual and less in government and institutions; they want more cooperation and less competition.
- I feed on conferences.
- I believe that social change has almost reached critical mass. So many people have undergone personal transformation that their effect on society is having a geometric - not arithmetic - impact. This coalescence of energies brings about meeting, networking, and a sophistication in communications that is unprecedented in history.
- You can break through old limits, past inertia and fear, to... richness of choice, freedom, human closeness.
- Sometimes things have to get worse before they get better.
- The chaos in our world may have brought you close to despair, but if you are willing to look at reasons for hope, perhaps you are ready for the 'Aquarian Conspiracy.'

- Academicians get nowhere.
- You can be more productive, confident, comfortable with insecurity.

- Everybody knows that love is better than hate, and peace is better than war.
- Power is changing hands, from dying hierarchies to living networks.

Its members have broken with certain key elements of Western thought, and they may even have broken continuity with history... this benign conspiracy for new human agenda has triggered the most rapid cultural realignment in history.
