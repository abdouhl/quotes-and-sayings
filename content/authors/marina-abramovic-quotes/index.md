- All the aggressive actions I do to myself I would never dream of doing in my own life - I am not this kind of person. I cry if I cut myself peeling potatoes. I am taking the plane, there is turbulence, I am shaking. In performance, I become, somehow, like not a mortal.

- I grew up with my grandmother because my parents were making careers and didn't have much time for me. She was a highly religious Serbian Orthodox, spending most of her time in church. It's a great mix, and I use all these elements in my work.

- When I taught art, I was always asked, 'How do you know you're an artist? What makes you an artist?' And to me, it's like breathing. You don't question if you breathe; you have to breathe. So if you wake up in the morning, and you have to realize an idea, and there's another idea, and another, maybe you are really an artist.
- There are good artists that have children. Of course there are. They are called men.
- I hate studio. For me, studio is a trap to overproduce and repeat yourself. It is a habit that leads to art pollution.

- I didn't get paid for performances most of my life. If I did, I would be billionaire now, and I'm not.
- You know how you feel somebody looking at you, and you turn, and somebody actually is? It's the same at an art gallery. You're looking at one portrait, turn around, and there is a work of art directly behind you. Because it's all energy. Every single thing has energy.
- If I'm not nervous, I'm nervous. You never know how people are going to receive the work.
- A powerful performance will transform everyone in the room.

- I am only interested in the ideas that become obsessive and make me feel uneasy. The ideas that I'm afraid of.

- People in New York never have time for anything.
- The world doesn't need an artist who shows reality as it is.
- I have always staged my fears as a way to transcend them.
- From a very early time, I understood that I only learn from things I don't like.
- From the very early stage when I started doing performance art in the '70s, the general attitude - not just me, but also my colleagues - was that there should not be any documentation, that the performance itself is artwork and there should be no documentation.
- Time is an illusion. Time only exists when we think about the past and the future. Time doesn't exist in the present here and now.
- You know I very much respect Yvonne Rainer, she is very important - in American dance, the entire development of modern dance, and creating a wonderful physical language.

- I believe the artist has an obligation to society.
- I hate studios. A studio is a black hole. I never use a studio to work. It's very artificial to go to a studio to get new ideas. You have to get new ideas from life, not from the studio. Then you go to the studio to realize the idea.
- Cancer is an emotional disease.
- An artist should not fall in love with another artist.
- I've been criticized by my generation, artists from the '70s - and there's nothing more tragic than artists from the '70s still doing art from the '70s - because I blur all these borders between fashion and pop.
- For me, performance is a holy ground. When I perform, I really step into a different state of consciousness.
- The only time I really feel tired and old is when I look back; I always like to look just in the front of me. I'll always feel like I didn't finish enough, such a short time is left, and there's still so much to do.
- People have so much pain inside them that they're not even aware of.
- I want to dominate the man's world.
- In every ancient culture, there are rituals to mortify the body as a way of understanding that the energy of the soul is indestructible.
