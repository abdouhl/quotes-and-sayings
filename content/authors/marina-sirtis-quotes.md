- As an actor, of course, you want to be in something that's successful.
- The thing about 'Star Trek' is that it is not judgmental. You can do what ever you want, within reason.
- I was originally cast to be the brains of the Enterprise. Somehow I became The Chick. There's a little ugly girl inside of me going 'Yay! I'm a sex symbol!'
- What they told us about 'Star Trek: The Next Generation' when we first started was that we were guaranteed 26 episodes, so that was the longest job I've ever had. And that was basically it - we didn't know what the premise of the show was going to be and we waited, week by week, to see a script.
- Gene Roddenberry's thing always was, we should not pass judgment on anything that anyone else believes in or what they do in their lives.
- I wasn't a 'Star Trek' fan, yet I knew who all the characters were. that goes to show what an impact the show had not just in entertainment but in life. I knew who Chekhov was and I knew who Kirk and Spock were, although I probably had never seen the show.
- I am not a sound bite person. I prefer to run at the mouth.
- I've been getting a lot of science fiction scripts which contained variations on my 'Star Trek' character and I've been turning them down. I strongly feel that the next role I do, I should not be wearing spandex.
