- Brexit wasn't the European people's first cry of revolt. In 2005, France and the Netherlands held referendums about the proposed European Union constitution.

- I am well placed to know that Le Pen is not an anti-Semite. If one considers his life seriously... a man who went to fight with the Israelis in '56! Many times, he tried to better the party's relationship with the Jewish community, even though I do not like the term.
- We cannot let ourselves be infantalized. We cannot let ourselves be stereotyped.

- I'm against the Right of money and the Left of money.
- They have acted like carnivores who used the world to enrich only themselves, and whether it's the election of Donald Trump, or Brexit, the elites have realized that the people have stopped listening to them, that the people want to determine their futures and, in a perfectly democratic framework, regain control of their destiny.
- The euro ceases to exist the moment that France leaves.
- Do we want a multicultural society, following the model of the English-speaking world, where fundamental Islam is progressing and we see major religious claims, or do we want an independent nation, with people able to control their own destiny, or do we accept to be a region managed by the technocrats of the European Union?

- The reality is that Islam is facing a phenomenal rise with regards to fundamentalism. It cannot control it, but what is sure is that neither can European states control and monitor the development of fundamentalist networks in their own territory.
- I think France should be free, independent, and be the cultural heart of the world because those play a balance in the world.
- I believe that politics is a matter of person. Specifically in the Fifth French Republic. In a healthy political system, a political party should resemble its leader.
- I think that the elites have lived too long among themselves.
- I believe that sovereignty is the twin sister of democracy. If there's no sovereignty, there's no democracy.
- I chose as the campaign logo a blue rose, which means 'make possible the impossible.' I think the British with Brexit, then the Americans with the election of Donald Trump, did that: They made possible the impossible.
- I do not stop repeating it to French Jews... Not only is the National Front not your enemy, but it is without a doubt the best shield to protect you. It stands at your side for the defense of our freedoms of thought and of religion against the only real enemy: Islamist fundamentalism.
- I consider that France and the Republic were in London during the occupation and that the Vichy regime was not France.
- Russia is a European country, and so we'd better, if we want a powerful Europe, negotiate with Russia.
- It's true that I have a strong social sensibility, because - bah, because I raised thre children on my own, and I know the difficulties that can represent. All of that makes it appear that there's a difference between Jean-Marie Le Pen's program and mine. But the big ideas are the same.

- France can certainly accommodate foreign people on its soil long-term, those with foreign citizenship... as long as they respect French laws and French values, which is often a problem on the immigration issue. It's not really a problem with Israel on this topic.

- I would never betray the people.
- We have to go into fundamentalist mosques; we have to stop foreign financing of Islamist groups.

- Without any action, this migratory influx will be like the barbarian invasion of the 4th century, and the consequences will be the same. We must immediately stop this madness to safeguard our social pact, freedom, and identity.
- When people live on our territory and are not criminals, they do not dispute our laws or our ways of living, our customs, our values. I see no reason why we should not continue to welcome them in the French style.

- You cannot force a country to do something that is against its own interests or against the democratic process.
- There's a big difference between France and the U.S. In the U.S., immigrants must work to live. In France, they're taken care of by public finances. In France, there are millions of unemployed people already. We cannot house them, give them health care, education... finance people who keep coming and coming.
- I have never tried to bear a judgment against my own father because I consider that, in our European culture, one does not judge his parents. Now, I have expressed my disagreements with my father on certain points, disagreements related to the way one should express things, something that has also to do with a difference of generations.

- Honestly, the dangerous situation in which Jews in France live is such that those who walk with a kippa are in any case a minority, because they are afraid.

- I think 2017 is going to be the year of the grand return of the nation-state, the control of borders and currencies.

- I am opposed to those who have an ideological vision of immigration, and I think that, given the situation in France, it must stop.
