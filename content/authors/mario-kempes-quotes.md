- Argentina have always produced very good players, and mine is just another name on the list.
- Good players can do well everywhere and Soldado is a good footballer.
- You don't get called up to the national team because you tell good jokes, you are funny, you are handsome or because you are Messi's friend. You are called up because you have a role at your given club and you have personality.
- A World Cup without Argentina and without Messi would be a catastrophe.
- I am lucky because I can feel at home anywhere, I don't get homesick.
- You can only succeed by playing in the way which comes naturally to you.
- Maradona was absolutely the best player I ever played with.
- Maradona is Maradona, that's indisputable, but he doesn't play anymore. He stopped playing a long time ago.
- I will tell you another thing, we Argentines criticise Messi because we are specialists in criticising what is ours.
- You can put the players on the pitch but they always move and systems change. I think, though, that Messi has to be a special case and that the other nine outfield players should support him. But one player on his own is not going to win you the World Cup.
- When Diego won the World Cup in 1986, perhaps he had the luck that Messi has not had. Diego had very good teammates and things went well.
- Now winning is more important and it trumps the way you achieve it. Unfortunately for soccer, the style doesn't matter so much.
- You cannot give the ball to Messi all the time.
- I wasn't a No. 9, as everyone believes today. Every time I played as a No. 9, I failed.
- Suarez and Neymar play the way they play because of him. They are great players but they are made greater by Messi.
- Messi is Messi and Messi is Barcelona.
- We cannot pretend that Messi will solve all the problems. He cannot carry everything on his shoulders.
- I think players of the national team are not entitled to make an opinion about who is making the team and who is not. At least in my days it was like that.
- It is very difficult to play beside Messi and whoever understands it any other way is a fool.
- I love travelling and if my wife and my daughter are with me - I am happy.
- Machines can break down under pressure. But so can humans.
- This is one thing every coach can take from Menotti. If you win the World Cup, no one can criticize you.
- On the field Icardi always does a good job, what he does off it, I don't care at all. What I do care is what he does for my team on the pitch.
- I wasn't your average striker because I didn't play as an out-and-out centre-forward.
- I love working, wherever it is.
- I couldn't be bothered with the whole shaving-every-couple-of-days routine.
- When you're a player and you win the World Cup and other titles you don't get the chance to enjoy the moment because of the media scrum. You end up getting tired of it. But when the years go by and you look back on it all, then you understand just what it is that you achieved, that we achieved.
- Sometimes it is not bad to be scared.
- The only ones who would be happy if Messi doesn't go to the World Cup would be Maradona fans because, that way, they can keep saying that he's the best.
- Messi is a human being and we have to respect him.
- I have worked in so many countries over the years that I must have moved house about 20 times.
- I have stopped being a Valencia ambassador through contract but not through the heart.
- I wasn't skilful at all... but I'm not saying I was that bad either! I used to take my chances. I was more of a midfielder and therefore a weird striker.
- Every time Maradona speaks it makes life difficult for everyone and there are those of us who don't agree with that, not when he talks about football, but rather about people.
- Dybala only lacks the belief that he is a great footballer. After his great experience at Palermo he had a great start with Juve and he did beautiful things.
- If you ask me who I would have liked to play with, I would say that with Messi.
- For any tournament to succeed, you need the big guns to fire.
- Messi owes something to Argentina. He knows that.
- I don't score many with my head but, as it happened, that's how I netted my first-ever World Cup goal.
- All of us know that Messi cannot win alone, except for the fanatics or the mental patients who put in doubt Messi's talents, saying that he is a bottler, that he feels nothing for Argentina, that he doesn't sing the anthem, that he goes to the bathroom 50 times before a game. Those are things that are said to make an impression.
- Argentina is a powerhouse in soccer.
- People are saying: 'the Argentina uniform should not be stained.' Forget about it. The Argentina uniform is already pretty stained.
- I love being able to play myself if I fancy, and take myself off as soon as I've had enough.
- I'd love to work in Argentina but there aren't any possibilities to manage there. The managers always remain the same. They just swap clubs once in a while.
- I remember listening to my first World Cup in 1966. I was with my parents, helping them build our house and listening to it on the radio. We still didn't have a TV back then, but fortunately the first time I listened to a World Cup Jose Maria Munoz was commentating, and he's one of the best there is.
- What's the problem that people have here in Spain with Maradona and Messi? They spend the whole day comparing them.
- It's impossible to replace him. You will not find another Messi, but you can train a team without having the best in the world.
- Every time the national team took to the field, we had the confetti shower and the ticker-tape thing.
- They say Maradona is God, but there's only one God!
- The game was different then, when I used to play. The ball ran more than the players and to some extent there was greater technical skill.
- It's different the way the game is played now and the way we played the game.
- All teams starting the season should aim to be as high as possible and Valencia are no exception.
- Clearly finals are one-off games and they always depend on starting well in order to impose yourself on the game.
- Maradona doesn't play soccer anymore, he coaches it. He needs to remember that.
- Times have changed. Football has changed.
- Missing the 1978 World Cup made Maradona an even better player, as he showed on the following year at the Youth World Cup, and he never looked back.
- English football is a lot different to Spanish football but Soldado is an international for Spain, he is a player who has become accustomed to playing against great teams - and he has always scored goals.
- What Guardiola has done as coach of Barcelona is really spectacular.
- I am just one of many who have played their part in Argentina's football history.
- In one game I'd have defenders completely wiping me out, but three days later I'd have my chance to get revenge. What had happened a few days earlier would never affect my confidence.
- Even Cristiano Ronaldo has developed from a selfish goalscorer into someone who likes to pass the ball.
- Argentina has never been able to convince itself that it can win in Brazil. For some reason we have always struggled.
- I started every match knowing that this could be my day. It's like in life; you can have a bad business idea, but then you have a new one the next day and you just go for it.
- Lautaro, for a couple of years now, has proven to be a great No.9. He's shown it at Inter and Argentina.
- It's not easy to carry forward the national team because you have a whole country behind you. But I would be willing to take charge of the Argentina national team.
