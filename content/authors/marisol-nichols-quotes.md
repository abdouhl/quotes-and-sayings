- Growing up, I just wanted to be like everyone else. I didn't value or understand the beauty in being different at the time in my life.
- I'm pretty good with languages.
- Yes, I have used my success to bring goodness to the world. Because I'm an actress, and I'm on someone's favorite show or whatever, I think maybe they will listen to me. I feel there's a responsibility to use that platform wisely.
- I really want to work with Tim Burton and Johnny Depp.

- The second I got on stage, it was like, 'Oh my God! I love this! I love this!'

- I have two paintings that used to belong to my grandmother, who lived in Chicago. When I was young, I used to sleep over at her house. They came to me when she passed away. I remember looking at them when I was a girl, and now, every time I see them, I feel good.
- If it's an international flight, I always like to wear a sheet mask.
- When I first moved from Chicago to L.A., I starred in the 'Vacation' movies as Audrey Griswald, and that was like the starring role in a Warner Brothers movie. I thought everything was made, and then six months later, I'm back auditioning.
- We moved around a ton when I was a kid. I think we lived in 9 different houses before I was 15 - we moved from the city back to the suburbs; different suburbs, different houses, all over the place.
- Years ago, I used to skip breakfast altogether, wrongly thinking that if I didn't eat it, I might lose weight or something.
- I had a job since I was 12 years old. I did everything under the sun. I pumped gas. I worked at gas stations, car washes, dry cleaners, anything and everything that I had to do to pay the bills. So for me, I know what it's like to hustle.
- Every year, my family and I would go visit my mom's family in Texas. We would drive from Chicago to Texas, and once we started to get towards San Antonio, everyone looked like me! It was such a great feeling. Everyone had the same brown skin that I did.
- Nothing really prepared me for the amount of work, or the amount of rewards, that came with being a new mom.

- Use spices for flavor in food rather than adding a bunch of oils, fats, or sauces.
- I use Stevia instead of sweetener. I add it to coffee or tea instead of sugar - you can even cook with it. The vanilla flavor is to die for!
- As soon as I became a mom, my birthday stopped having any meaning whatsoever.
- I love Vancouver.
- If you want a favorite book, Orson Scott Card's 'Ender's Game'. You'll be hooked. I think he's written like twelve or thirteen.
- I am not really ever accused of being shy or meek.
- I would love to do a really stupid character on 'The Office'. I'm so an 'Office' fan.
- I can bring Rain with me everywhere I go, but when she's in school, I don't know what I'll do. The longest I've been away from her is three days, and I cried my eyes out. The first day of school will be so hard.
