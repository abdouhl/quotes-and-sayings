- I'm a geek.
- If I had been more self-conscious about being a woman, it would have stifled me.
- I think, you know, a fellow CEO said to me that the interesting thing about being CEO that's really striking is that you have very few decisions that you need to make, and you need to make them absolutely perfectly.
- Will the social networking phenomenon lessen? I don't think so.
- One of the interesting applications of symbolic systems is artificial intelligence, and I spent some time thinking about how to create a brain that operates the way ours does.
- The baby's been way easier than everyone made it out to be.
- Yahoo!, over the years, had been the king of the banner ad.
- For many people, Google is the most important tool on the Web.
- Eric Schmidt from Google is one of my favorite mentors. And Eric would always say this very humbling thing that's really true, which is, he would say, 'Good executives confuse themselves when they convince themselves that they actually do things.'
- I really like even numbers, and I like heavily divisible numbers. Twelve is my lucky number - I just love how divisible it is. I don't like odd numbers, and I really don't like primes. When I turned 37, I put on a strong face, but I was not looking forward to 37. But 37 turned out to be a pretty amazing year.
- Really in technology, it's about the people, getting the best people, retaining them, nurturing a creative environment and helping to find a way to innovate.
- If you can find something that you're really passionate about, whether you're a man or a woman comes a lot less into play. Passion is a gender-neutralizing force.
- Our theory is, if you need the user to tell you what you're selling, then you don't know what you're selling, and it's probably not going to be a good experience.
- The turning point for me was realizing that I would learn more at Google, trying to build a company, regardless of whether we failed or succeeded, than I would at any of the other companies I had offers from.
- I loved Stanford and symbolic systems. For me, I came to Stanford assuming I would be a doctor and got really deep into chemistry and biology, but I noticed everyone who was on the same track as me was taking the exact same classes. I wanted to do something more unique.
- I refuse to be stereotyped.
- Search is an unsolved problem.
- I could imagine, some number of years from now, starting my own company. But not yet. Not for a while.
- When you're coming into a company and, you know, have to do a transformation, what you really want to do is look at the company and say, 'Okay, here are the parts that the company does well. How do we get those genes to hyper-express? The genes that are getting in the way, how do you turn those off?'
- Product management really is the fusion between technology, what engineers do - and the business side.
- I have a theory that burnout is about resentment. And you beat it by knowing what it is you're giving up that makes you resentful.
- I didn't want to lose my sense of myself in my profession.
- I took a computer-science course to fill a prerequisite at Stanford, and I realized that every day was a new problem, and every day you got to think about how to solve something new, how to reason through something new, how to develop an algorithm to solve for something you hadn't worked on before.
- Management is defense. You basically say, 'This is the direction; this is where we're heading,' and then it's my job to get everything else out of the way. All the other things that can become a distraction keep us from executing well. Get those out of the way, because the team ultimately needs to run in that direction and execute well.

- For some people, what really matters to them is sleep.
- Well, I think the social networking is really interesting.
- The interesting thing is when you look at what people want to do on their phone, it's mail, weather, check stock quotes and news. That's Yahoo's business. This is a huge opportunity for us because we have the content and all the information people want on their phones.
- I want Yahoo to be the absolute best place to work, to have a fantastic culture.
- I was Google's first woman engineer.
- Well, I have one of the best jobs in the world.
- I love technology, and I don't think it's something that should divide along gender lines.
- I always did something I was a little not ready to do. I think that's how you grow. When there's that moment of 'Wow, I'm not really sure I can do this,' and you push through those moments, that's when you have a breakthrough.
- I think that there is a generational change, where new generations that have grown up always having access to the internet have a somewhat different view in terms of personal information and what needs to be kept private.
- Walmart is an amazing story of entrepreneurship and, as one of the world's most powerful brands, touches millions of lives every day.
- What you want, when you want it. As opposed to everything you could ever want, even when you don't.
- I had to think really hard about how to choose between job offers.
- I was always good at math and science, and I never realized that that was unusual or somehow undesirable.
- I don't believe in balance, not in the classic way.
- Geeks are people who love something so much that all the details matter.
- Blackberry is a great product and really useful. But I think that Yahoo!'s future is going to be rooted in mobile apps. And we know that we need to have apps on some of the core platforms, and so iOS and Android, probably the two most important platforms for us.

- I've always liked simplicity.

- I think what's really amazing is that given the scale of the web and getting the compute power we have today, we're starting to see things that appear intelligent but actually aren't semantically intelligent.

- I think that for me, it's God, family and Yahoo - in that order.
- With data collection, 'The sooner the better' is always the best answer.
- I like to stay in the rhythm of things.
- Shifting toward management meant greater responsibility and influence, but it also meant giving up programming day-to-day in my role, which was hard because it took me out of my comfort zone.
- I really wanted to be a doctor, until my freshman year of college when I realized that while I was good at chemistry and biology, I really wasn't feeling challenged by it.
- I think that ultimately over time we really should strive for a place where most information is available online and is searchable.
- When I came to Yahoo! in 2012, I came because I really wanted to work hard. I thought it was a great challenge.
- I pace myself by taking a week-long vacation every four months.
- I don't feel overwhelmed with information. I really like it.
- You can be good at technology and like fashion and art. You can be good at technology and be a jock. You can be good at technology and be a mom. You can do it your way, on your terms.
- When people think about computer science, they imagine people with pocket protectors and thick glasses who code all night.
- I don't think that I would consider myself a feminist. I think that I certainly believe in equal rights, I believe that women are just as capable, if not more so in a lot of different dimensions, but I don't, I think have, sort of, the militant drive and the sort of, the chip on the shoulder that sometimes comes with that.
- I like to get myself in over my head.
- The internet creates more of an appetite for media - it doesn't replace physical books, radio or TV.
- There are probably industries where gender is more of an issue, but our industry is not one where I think that's relevant.
- I think it's very comforting for people to put me in a box. 'Oh, she's a fluffy girlie girl who likes clothes and cupcakes. Oh, but wait, she is spending her weekends doing hardware electronics.'
- I think that burnout happens because of resentment. That notion that, 'Wow, I worked 100 hours last week, and I couldn't even have this thing that I really wanted.'
- When you need to innovate, you need collaboration.
- The thing that surprised me and really puzzled me is that the job is really fun. Yahoo is a really fun place to work.
- My first week at Stanford, I bought a computer, and it was the first computer I ever owned. I had to be taught how to turn it on and even how to use a mouse, even though, for a lot of people, a mouse is very intuitive.
- Employees, especially young people, want more than a paycheck.
- I don't need much sleep.
- To me, speed is really about convenience.
- Before Google, I spent the summer building a program that would look at what websites you would go to and what websites other people would go to - and built a collaborative filtering program that helped you find related sites to look at.
- The utmost thing is the user experience, to have the most useful experience.
- I didn't set out to be at the top of technology companies. I'm just geeky and shy, and I like to code.
- I like to do matrices. One option per line, different facets for each column. Salary, location, happiness index, failure index, and all that.
- I really believe that the virtual world mirrors the physical world.
- I think Google should be like a Swiss Army knife: clean, simple, the tool you want to take everywhere.
- I like to stay in the rhythm of things. My maternity leave will be a few weeks long, and I'll work throughout it.
- Communications is the biggest driver of frequency of use of anything. Think about how many times a day you check your email on your phone or text someone or message someone.
- It was a very well-rounded childhood with lots of different opportunities. My mom will say she set out to overstimulate me - surround me with way too many things and let me pick. As a result, I've always been a multitasker; I've always liked a lot of variety.
- Beyond basic mathematical aptitude, the difference between good programmers and great programmers is verbal ability.
- Good students are good at all things.
