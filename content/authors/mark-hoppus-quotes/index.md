- I miss the experience of walking into a record store and find old stuff without expecting to.
- I'm always asking friends what new music they're into, and I love showing people new talented artists.

- I firmly believe artists should be paid for what they create.
- Thank God I never got in a fight. All of the jock dudes hated me, but all of their girlfriends thought I was nice so they wouldn't touch me. It was infuriating to them.
- Make yourself look really stupid so you don't feel bad doing something a little stupid.
- I never thought of punk rock as the absolute act of rebellion for the sake of rebellion. There's a lot of that in there, but for me I think punk rock was always about questioning things and making decisions for yourself, which is a great message to pass on to your kids.
- Once you declare your loyalty to a team, every person who doesn't support that team, it's their job to ruin you, to tell you you're an idiot and to tell you that you made the wrong choice.
- I did mostly good things, except light things on fire.

- During the downtime on tour, I simply walk from room to room, staring into my computer.
- We're really good friends and we hang out. It's like I get to hang out with my friends and get paid for it.
- We just kind of did our own thing and got made fun of by the popular kids. It was kind of like a badge of honor to be an outcast.
- The naked thing was short-lived. It was only around for about six months because we thought it was shocking. Once people expected us to do it we kind of never did it again.
- I don't want to spend a month and a half in a studio with music I don't like, and fortunately I don't have to.
- The thing you realize as you get older is that parents don't know what the Hell they're doing and neither will you when you get to be a parent.
- There's no doubt that the ready availability of music online has created a thousand more opportunities than it's destroyed.
- I don't have a problem being on 'MTV,' and I don't have a problem being on the radio. I actually like it. So there. And anyone that calls me a sell out is just jealous.
- Ideas are really what interest me in producing a band, if I can bring something productive to the project.
- Parents don't understand kids and kids don't understand parents. My parents were divorced when I was really young and I went to live with my dad.
- Screw them. Yeah. But not literally. I'm not advocating promiscuity.
- Everything in high school seems like the most important thing that's ever happened in your life. It's not. You'll get out of high school and you never see those people again. All the people who torment and press you won't make a difference in your life in the long haul.
- Mom's dad was in the army, stormed the beach at Normandy, fought through the French hedgerows, the Battle of the Ardennes, the Battle of the Bulge, and liberated concentration camps at the end of the war.
- I just want everyone out there to know that I'm super-awesome and a great guy and really cool to talk to and that I appreciate all the support.
- It's a real challenge to complete a story arc and end up with a cool punchline in 120 characters.
- I grew up the biggest fan of the Cure. Knew every lyric, had every album, B-side, single, poster, everything. Then cut to fifteen years later, and we're working on songs together. Ridiculous.
- I like the beaches in Orange County the best. I think Orange County has great beaches. Everything from Dana Point to Newport to Laguna; all over the place.
- 'The White Album' is a record I can go back to time and time again, and always find something different that I never noticed or appreciated before.
- If we tried to write about politics, you'd realize that we're all a bunch of idiots.
- I don't stream or buy CDs... pretty much everything I buy, I do it on iTunes.
- Antarctica is otherworldly, like nothing I've ever seen before. Stark, cold, beautiful desolation.

- I believe that artists should be paid for their creativity. There's no other industry where people can come in and take what you create for free and give it away for free and that's acceptable.
- All I can hope to do is instill great morality in my son and trust him along the way. The music he listens to or how he chooses to wear his hair doesn't define his moral compass, and if he wants to listen to country music and wear a cowboy hat too, that's fine.
- Music is life. Music defines peoples' experience on this planet. Name one time in your life that wasn't punctuated by the music you listened to at the time. When people are down, they listen to music that commiserates that emotion. When people are amped up, they listen to more upbeat, loud songs.
- My parents were pretty lenient with me. But, they gave me morality while I was growing up. They taught me the difference between right and wrong.
- Getting to meet other artists that I admire is one of the best parts of my job. I don't know if I'd say 'star struck' as much as excited to hear other peoples' ideas.
- I dated the same girl all through high school.
- I don't think of them as teenage songs. The things that happen to you in high school are the same things that happen your entire life. You can fall in love at 60; you can get rejected at 80.
- I lived in small town out in the desert and my friend used to steal his mom's car in the middle of the night. He'd drive over to my house, I'd sneak out and we'd go out to the desert and just burn things down.
