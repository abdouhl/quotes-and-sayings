- I want to show that I'm a real teenager, not some fantasized Hollywood kid.
- 'Ugly Betty' has been four years of my life, important adolescent years. I think that all I've really known was getting pampered and interviewed and getting my picture taken.
- 'Ugly Betty' has opened my eyes to the world of fashion journalism - I'm looking forward to going to college for that. Until then, I don't know. Will I appear on 'Glee?'
- 'Ugly Betty' taught me everything about fashion.
- I definitely love T.V.
- Chloe Sevigny always dresses appropriately but doesn't blend in with the crowd.
- I'm really interested in fashion journalism.
- I've loved musicals ever since I saw 'The Lion King' on Broadway.
- Before I really became interested in fashion, all I would look at in a fashion magazine was the ads. It only dawned on me recently that just looking at the ads really doesn't teach you everything you need to know about the fashion world.
- I didn't know who Jimmy Choo was. I think Vanessa Williams was also a very big part of that, teaching me about the designers. I had no choice but to learn, and I'm glad I did.
- I came from a small town in Pennsylvania - where 'style' was whatever was new at the Gap. Being on 'Ugly Betty' at such a crucial time in my life sparked my love for the industry.
- It's very hard to be OK with who you are and not care what other people think of you. Believe me, I know.
- I want to do a jean line for boys and girls that are sometimes too skinny to fit into jeans, or sometimes a little bit too husky to fit into some jeans.
- I've been doing a lot of stuff that has to do with charity and giving. I'm trying to give and not take as much.
- I know you don't always need to spend a ton of money to be stylish.
- Fashion week is very inspiring, and you can't look at things one dimensionally. And I think that everyone who works in this industry has a very three-dimensional view of what fashion is and what art is.
- Ugly Betty' has definitely helped me cope with issues I would have never been able to cope with if I wasn't a part of a show that has such unique characters.
- I think that androgyny is so amazing. Men's shows I can look at and say, 'I would wear that.' But there's things I see at Nina Ricci, and I'm like, 'They need to make that in men's,' or 'I want those pants.' Everything is inspiring.
- When I was 4, my dad let me 'help' him back out of the driveway, but I'm amazing at driving golf carts.
- I would never turn down a movie, but at the same time, but my ideal job would be a half-hour sitcom.
- I guess if you're independent, not afraid of much, and extremely stylish, that makes you a pretty good candidate for being a New Yorker.
