- I was lucky enough to get to perform on stage in front of 20 million people on TV, and 150 thousand in concerts. For 15 minutes I got to be a rock star, the 15 minutes is great! It turns into Spinal Tap after 20 minutes.
- Rebellion is obsolete - change things from the inside working out.
- I really appreciate anyone trying to inject art into mainstream film.
- I don't cook - I can cook - but I'm not very good. I like being asked over for dinner, because she can't cook either. We would starve if it weren't for modern technology. I know how to work a microwave, but love home cooked meals.
- As far as the style, I was fascinated by surrealism.
- My major was Fine Arts and Education thinking I would become an Art Teacher. I couldn't visualize myself as an art teacher, thinking how it wouldn't work.
- We've turned down multi million dollar films, simply because we liked the film better. We have the luxury to do so - we have projects that make the money, and others that we do for love.
- The stories I write are often literal to events that have happened or observations that I've made, and sometimes they're fantastical.
- When I was a kid, the book that I liked the most was 'Aesop's Fables.' There was a version of it that my father read stories to us kids out of. I liked the idea of the short story format.
- I went to Kent State basically to avoid going to Vietnam, I had no idea what I was doing in the world. I was lost, and trying not to get into a fight every day.
- Right now I just finished writing the music for a Rugrats feature film and the third week of September I go to London, and the Orchestra is going to perform the score.
- To me I think artists in general make a statement - and for the rest of their lives - every album, every book - are variations on a theme.
- I write all the time. I do artwork that's part of a diary, and I write short stories to go with them pretty much every day.
- My favorite films, I would put my answering machine up to the television set and hit record. I'd tape my favorite movies and then I could go back and listen to them again. I only had the soundtrack, I didn't have the visuals. But I think it made me really pay attention to the soundtracks.
- Personally I'm very happy to be behind the scenes. I like collaboration, I like working with directors.
- I've worked with a lot of directors, some of them you wouldn't really attach the word 'artist' to their name.
- 'To Kill a Mockingbird' represents Hollywood at its very finest, when a popular film could truly contain a message. It has one of the most moving scores of all time.
