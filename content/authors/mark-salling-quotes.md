- You don't really have time to watch TV if you work on TV.
- I like a girl who doesn't play any games. I like a very sweet girl.
- I saw the film 'Amadeus' from when I was five, which made me want to take piano lessons.
- I'm not really anything like Puck - I'm worse!
- I've had so many different influences musically, even from people who aren't even musicians. If you're inspired by someone and you document it musically, then they are your influence.
- I would like to be known as an 'artist'. Whether that be music, acting, sketching, cooking, whatever. I'm interested in all of those things.
- Music is my wife, and acting is my girlfriend.
- Girls don't really recognize me on the street. No one has tried to serenade me or rip my shirt off.
- I decided I wanted to be a musician when I saw the movie 'Amadeus' around 1987. I was five years old, so it was a good time to start piano lessons after seeing Tom Hulce who played Mozart play the harpsichord on his back with his hands crossed. Such a great movie to inspire a five-year-old.
- I've been through almost every type of obsession as far as music genres go, so I usually say I just like a good song, but the songs that are the most universal that a person on the other side of the world knows and can relate to is a very powerful entity.
- I usually go for the ethnic ladies. That's kinda my preference, but I don't discriminate.
- I love nineties stuff like Alice in Chains and Nine Inch Nails. It'd be my dream to have a Radiohead-themed episode of 'Glee.' I also love jazz greats like Coltrane, Miles Davis, and Herbie Hancock.
- I play a bad boy on television, but in real life I have a passion for nature and nature conservancy, specifically bird rehabilitation.
- Every day, I hear a song and I think, 'This would be great to cover on Glee.' I like Led Zeppelin, of course, and Pink Floyd, Alice in Chains.
- Doing good for the community is something that should be a part of who you are. The more you get, the more you should give back.
- Some girls go for bad boys because they like the challenge of changing them - which is usually unrealistic.
- 'Ten' by Pearl Jam is still by far one of my favorite albums and is a big part of what inspired me to learn guitar.
- I don't usually try to rely on songs to woo a girl, but I think Coldplay can get a girl in the mood... or make her cry, one or the other. I used to play in cover bands; we sure did our fair share of Coldplay. I like 'Viva La Vida.'
- It's great that 'Glee' is making viewers more aware of the arts. People appreciate it.
- Playing music was always a part of my life; I don't know anything else.
- I play Xbox in my underwear.
- I've studied several guitar players and songwriters, mostly from Al di Meola to Dimebag Darrell, from Freddie Mercury of Queen to Kurt Cobain of Nirvana and Bradley Nowell of Sublime.
- Glee's good because it tackles the issues by embracing what's different, and telling people, 'That's what makes you special' - I think that's the underlying thing.
