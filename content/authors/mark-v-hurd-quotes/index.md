- I like being pushed.
- I like to have a team environment where I can go anywhere and not threaten management.
- After formulating and communicating the right strategy and optimizing operations to execute that strategy, CEOs and other top leaders then must be able to build management teams that truly understand the big picture.
- CIOs have earned a strategic seat at the table, but now they've got to hold that seat - and the only way they can do that is to converse in the language of business value and business benefits and business outcomes that all align perfectly with the strategic agenda of the company.
- We make a significant effort at Oracle to focus the organization on making customers successful in how they deploy Oracle technology and transform their business through IT.

- Without execution, 'vision' is just another word for hallucination.
- The more I use a matrix, the easier I make it to blame someone else.
- I'm old, I'm used to crummy service, I'm trained to get crummy service. To me, the fact I can get through to a call centre and then hold for 15 minutes, I don't get that upset. My kids won't. They want to know the answer to their question now. As a company you have to provide an answer to that consumer.
- My objective with strategy is to be very repetitive, to be somewhat boring, to allow people to coalesce behind a common direction.

- I go all over the place. I do like the ability to go around the company at different levels to find the people that have the actual answers to the question.
- Most tech companies do one trick and die. If you can do two or three or four, that's where wealth gets created.
- In times of crisis, you just have to bear down and lean on your own instincts and your own beliefs and make decisions.

- Not everyone is comfortable with being pushed.
- CEOs can stay too long.

- Like it or not, at HP we are technologists, not executive compensation consultants.
- Everyone wants to lead when things are going well.
- From a productivity standpoint, you're supposed to reduce headcount on par with declining revenue. If you believe the environment isn't going to improve, you should take a bigger cut to get in front of the problems.

- I have to put people in the right spot so that if they execute, we win.
- The fact that everything ever works perfectly together, anybody who tells you that is pulling your leg.
- Oracle will continue to componentize all of its solutions so we can work in a heterogeneous environment.
- It's counterproductive to lower my price, because I have to sell more units to make up for that lost revenue. Generating brand-new products can take a long time. Improving service is typically the quickest way that I can take market share. So aligning technology strategy to better service customers becomes an essential path to revenue growth.
- At its core, HP has the best technologists on the planet Earth.
- I really don't want the best people at the highest cost.
- Customers want to talk to other customers.
