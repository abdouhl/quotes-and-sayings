- Cycling keeps me lean and I need to stay in shape, especially as I still like eating chocolate and ice-cream! I like to go mountain biking too. Running is also good; it's what we were designed to do as humans, so it comes naturally.
- When I'm driving I should make more of an effort with my iPod, but I'm too lazy to organise a playlist.
- We don't get groupies, well I don't see them, anyway. That was something that I always looked forward to and am constantly disappointed by the lack of!
- My mother and I took over abandoned buildings to sleep in.
- I love driving at Monaco but the rest of it, well, I can absolutely take it or leave it. It's extremely pretentious and really not my cup of tea.
- Red Bull are backing a spinal-injury research charity called Wings For Life, which I am an ambassador for, with a programme called Faces for Charity that will run at this year's British Grand Prix.
- Formula one is very one-dimensional in terms of what we do in the cockpit.
- Only one guy can be world champion, and so if everyone else thought they were failures you'd have no one left on the grid.
- I am healthy, my family is healthy. That is the important thing. After that we go racing.
- For me to train and get ready for racing, I can't just sit in the gym all the time and that's the way it is. Responsibility starts and stops with me. My main gig is grand prix driving, that's what I do and I need to keep that in the forefront of my mind.
- Winning in Monaco is always special. That track has always been good to me. I won there in Formula 3000, battled for the victory with Williams in 2006 and now I've won two of the last three grands prix there.
- I hate wearing trousers and shoes. I wear jeans and sneakers most of the time.
- You know, when my dad was a racing fan in Australia he would follow Jack Brabham and sometimes only hear if he won two days after a race - when the result finally appeared in his newspaper. These days I can tweet something and it's all over the world in seconds.
- I would love to be better at cooking but I hate cleaning up afterwards. I love the process of putting everything together and the chance of getting it right or wrong but it takes ten minutes to eat it and then ages to clean.
- Sitting beside the pool is fine for two weeks, but after that I think it'd be quite hard to live with - so I need to keep racing.
