- I've seen such a turnaround with this new administration, with President Trump, that when we came to a conclusion, the answer was yes - yes, we can make a difference.
- I didn't have any idea what politics was like. I was surprised at how difficult it is to get something done. In the private world, if I have an idea, I just do it.
- The last thing we want is to make people think we're going back on our word.
- I would have never run for office if it wasn't for the fact that my biggest threat to my company was the federal government and the overreach of the EPA. They've gone too far, and it's time for them to be pulled back in.

- The idea of having to match a pair of socks to your tie or to your pants just doesn't make any sense to me... With boots, you don't have to worry about it. Nobody sees your socks.
- A person gets pushed down; they think they're being 'body-slammed.' There's really not any certain thing - that came from more fake wrestling - you know, 'the body slam,' being picked up in the air and thrown to the ground. It's all in someone's interpretation of what someone thinks a 'body slam' really is.
- When we censor our history by disguising our scars, we belittle this process and the struggles our ancestors fought so hard to overcome. America doesn't cower behind political correctness. It defiantly and courageously moves forward, with its history as a reminder of where we have been.
- We've all lost our temper at some time. Unfortunately, not all of us have done it in a public setting.
- America is - and will always be - a success story. We have African Americans, Native Americans, Hispanics, and members of other ethnic groups elected to positions inside our governments.

- I'm willing to negotiate, but not compromise my core principles.
- As a Cherokee, I can attest to the fact that Native Americans have been on the losing side of history. Our rights have been infringed upon, our treaties have been broken, our culture has been stolen, and our tribes have been decimated at the hands of our own United States government.
- The American free enterprise system is the greatest tool to lift people out of poverty ever created in human history and when applied properly, does not discriminate by race, religion, or skin color.
- You've got to respect people; you've got to understand where they come from. We know where people in Oklahoma come from - that's why we get along.
- I'm paying more taxes inside my company and personally than I'll ever receive from Congress.
- Without question, I'm not a fan of the EPA. The EPA has overstepped their boundaries each and every day. They get into areas they shouldn't be involved in... the states have the right to regulate themselves if they have the ability to do so - and we do because we have the Department of Environmental Quality.
