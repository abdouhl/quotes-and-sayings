- When I am on the plane and turbulence kicks in, I can't abide it. I feel like we are all going to die, and it takes everything in me to stay calm. But there are worse things to have to cope with.
- I never understand when people say, 'School days are the best of your life.' So it's all downhill from 16? How depressing.
- I didn't grow up with pets, but I live alone and figured a dog might be good for me. His name is Drexl, and he's a shih-tzu.
- A well known director wouldn't take the chance on casting me for an American role after he discovered that I was English. Some time later, he expressed his regret that he hadn't taken the chance with me.
- I've taken classes most of my life, and it's no secret among my friends I want to be in a movie about dance. Maybe 'Step Up 2,' with the delightful Channing Tatum.
- I have never seen a ghost. But yes, I believe because I know too many people who have had experiences. When I lived in Notting Hill, I shared a flat with a mate who was convinced that there was a presence in our house.
- I know it sounds cliched, but if we just treated each other as we'd like to be treated ourselves, we'd all be doing a lot better.
- There is definitely a pressure for funny people to be funny. People want them to perform all the time.
- I think that Vegas is one of the wildest places I've ever been to. You can look to your left and there's a drag queen getting married by Elvis, to the right there is some old bird sticking quarters into a slot machine for hours.
- I enjoy the reaction I get in the U.S.A. when people discover I have an English accent. They don't expect that, and it's kind of a kick.
