- I'm trying to build a Disney. Not only as a creator, but also be able to create universes where then that content can go into toys, and live on multimedia platforms, whether it's apps, books, movies, cartoons. It's like building a whole world, which takes a lot of money.

- What if Macauley Culkin were black in 'Home Alone?' Most people would write it differently... but I would write it the same way.
- If you play sports, use sports. So many of our kids get used by the game and then get nothing out of it. Use it as a tool to open up other doors that you want to open in life.

- It's always cool to make a comeback like 45 Michael Jordan did, or like Marshawn Lynch.

- A lot of times when you're around really, really smart people, you don't really understand them.

- I'm not a guy who holds up a product and says, 'Drink this.'
- For some reason as a kid being a smart athlete didn't seem like the right thing, because you didn't fit in. You didn't want to be too smart because you'd be a nerd. But then you didn't want to be too dumb either because then you didn't get the grades you needed to play.
- I'm trying to build something that lasts forever. If it's tied to my legacy as an athlete, then when I'm gone, it will have no momentum or can't keep selling.

- I've always been creating, no one had to teach me how to create, I always made things.
