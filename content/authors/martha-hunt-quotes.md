- I think film is the best medium to inspire people. It's a combination of image, dialogue, and music, which can make for a powerful message or a simple escape.
- I think it is really important to indulge on the holidays, I think that we all deserve that; I think that the more you worry, the more it's a problem. I think everyone's relationship with food is all about giving your body what it wants and what it needs. I think indulging is good and working out, too, for sure!
- I think workout clothes should be fun! I definitely don't think I have to wear all black to work out. I would say I am more minimal in my personal style... but my workout style, anything goes.
- The most beautiful destination I've been to was the Seychelles Islands, and the most culturally inspiring place was Mumbai, India.
- Fitness is very important to me because it helps give me a routine when I travel. It gives me one hour of 'me' time and passes the time when I'm lonely. Living with scoliosis serves as a constant reminder to keep my core and back strong. If I get lazy, I feel it in my back first.
- If anything, I'm constantly trying to figure out how to look chic with the minimal effort required because I'm constantly packing. My off-duty style is always influenced by my mood.
- It's great to have girlfriends who are in the industry, that you know have your back.
- I do yoga almost daily. I try to fit in swimming and cycling when I can.
- I can't choose one favorite place because all destinations have something different to offer. My favorite city to explore is Paris; I love the culture of Morocco and the waterfalls in St. Lucia. I just can't choose one. I would like to go back to New Zealand to see more of what it has to offer.
- I think a scarf is the most versatile item. On a plane, it's good to wrap around when you're cold or rest your head on it. I love scarves.
- I've learned how to adapt to different cultures and understand all different walks of life. I've also learned that confidence is key, even if you have to fake it at times. Fake it till you make it, as they say.
- I like to look casual yet chic. I love high fashion, vintage, and places like Zara, of course.
- I was excited to come to Australia to shoot for Seafolly because I've been wanting to visit since I was young. There wasn't much time to explore because we were so busy, which happens often during shoots. We had to take a boat to the Whitsunday Islands every day to get to the locations, which was a great way to start the day.
- I try to keep it in a very low impact - I have scoliosis, so exercises can be really hard on my back, whether it's too much running, jumping or boxing. I'll do those things once in a while, but I keep it mostly Pilates, resistance-band based, softer exercises that build strength from inside the muscle.
- I truly wish I could sing.
- I think sometimes less is more. I don't think it helps to overdo exercising - I think you need to do it to keep your body healthy and fit, but there is a fine line between, you know, healthy and obsession. You have to build your foundation first. Your brain has to sort of connect to your body.
- After workouts, I always try to eat protein right away, like a protein smoothie or an organic protein bar - you get them online.
- It all started when I went to this model search in Charlotte when I was 18. That's when I met all these agents and realized I could do it, and I won! I met a photographer at the competition who persuaded me to sign with a different agency than the one that was offered to me. So, I started with a small agency and eventually moved up to IMG.
- Stella McCartney is just the coolest show to do. I love the collection. I love the setting. All of her stuff always feels so fresh.
- Growing up in the south, N.Y.C. always seemed like a destination to visit but not to live in.
- I think I just stick to eating a well-rounded diet. I don't cut out anything; if I crave something, I eat it. But I definitely try to stick to a balanced diet always.
- I stick to lots of protein and veggies and try not to eat so many carbs, even though carbs are my favorite. I eat healthy things like quinoa, and I add fresh juices to my diet to get extra vitamins.
- Taylor Swift - I can't say enough good things about her. I admire her so much as a person and as a role model for young women.
- I definitely feel most at home in New York City, although I get stir-crazy if I'm here too long.
