- In America, the policeman is a working-class hero. In England, the policeman is a working-class traitor.
- Deciding to write a novel about something - as opposed to finding you are writing a novel around something - sounds to me like a good evocation of writer's block.
- Language leads a double life - and so does the novelist. You chat with family and friends, you attend to your correspondence, you consult menus and shopping lists, you observe road signs, and so on. Then you enter your study, where language exists in quite another form - as the stuff of patterned artifice.
- I would never write about someone that forced me to write at a lower register than what I can write.
- It's an ancient idea that the leader of a democracy should not be the cleverest but the most average. That's an arguable point, but the world has decided otherwise - except in America, where it still divides the country right down the middle.
- Novelists are stamina merchants, grinders, nine-to-fivers, and their career curves follow the usual arc of human endeavour.
- If God existed, and if He cared for humankind, He would never have given us religion.
- When I go back to the core of my childhood, my cousin Lucy seems always to be in the peripheral vision of my memories. She is off to one side, always off to one side, with a book, with a scheme or a project or an enterprise.
- Bullets cannot be recalled. They cannot be uninvented. But they can be taken out of the gun.
- Money doesn't mind if we say it's evil, it goes from strength to strength. It's a fiction, an addiction, and a tacit conspiracy.
- Novelists tend to go off at 70, and I'm in a funk about it, I've got myself into a real paranoid funk about it, how the talent dies before the body.
- When we read, we are doing more than delectating words on a page stories, characters, images, notions. We are communing with the mind of the author.
- Tennis: the most perfect combination of athleticism, artistry, power, style, and wit. A beautiful game, but one so remorselessly travestied by the passage of time.
- If every inhabitant of a liberal democracy believes in liberal democracy, then it doesn't matter what creed or colour they are.
- It's becoming clearer and clearer to me that the world is there to be celebrated by writers, and in fact this is what all the good ones do, and that the great fashion for gloom and grimness was in fact a false path that certain writers took, I think in response to the horrors of the first half of the twentieth century.
- Only in art will the lion lie down with the lamb, and the rose grow without thorn.
- Novelists don't age as quickly as philosophers, who often face professional senility in their late twenties.
- No novel has ever changed anything, as far as I can see.
- Like fundamentalist Judaism and medieval Christianity, Islam is totalist. That is to say, it makes a total claim on the individual.
- Weapons are like money; no one knows the meaning of enough.
- The process of writing a novel is getting to know more about the novel until you know everything about it. And it's been described as a kind of dreamlike state where you're letting the novel make its own shape, and you're putting into it the pleasure of creation, which is intoxicating.
- Only in art will the lion lie down with the lamb, and the rose grow without the thorn.
- My literary career kicked off in 1956 when, as a resident of Swansea, South Wales, I published my first novel, 'Lucky Jim.'
- Everything seems fine until you're about 40. Then something is definitely beginning to go wrong. And you look in the mirror with your old habit of thinking, 'While I accept that everyone grows old and dies, it's a funny thing, but I'm an exception to that rule.'
- Style is not neutral; it gives moral directions.
- Jane was my wicked stepmother: she was generous, affectionate and resourceful; she salvaged my schooling and I owe her an unknowable debt for that. One flaw: sometimes, early on, she would tell me things designed to make me think less of my mother, and I would wave her away, saying, 'Jane, this just backfires and makes me think less of you.'
- All writers of fiction will at some point find themselves abandoning a piece of work - or find themselves putting it aside, as we gently say.
- Every 10 years you're a different person, and the really great books evolve with you as you get older. They're full of new rewards.
- Kingsley Amis was a lenient father. His paternal style, in the early years, can best be described as amiably minimalist - in other words, my mother did it all.
- All novelists write in a different way, but I always write in longhand and then do two versions of typescript on a computer.
- You cannot combine being a movie star with not being a movie star.
- The literary interview won't tell you what a writer is like. Far more compellingly to some, it will tell you what a writer is like to interview.
- When I wrote 'The Pregnant Widow' three or four years ago, I tried to reread my first novel, 'The Rachel Papers,' because their young heroes are the same age. I couldn't finish it. It seemed to me so technically slapdash and weak.
- Present-day Spain translates as many books into Spanish, annually, as the Arab world has translated into Arabic in the past 1,100 years.
- I am, incidentally, the only writer to have received the Somerset Maugham award twice - the first time for my first novel, the second time for my second first novel.
- The middle class is doing fine in fiction. But it's not what gets me going. I love the working class, and everyone from it I've met, and think they're incredibly witty, inventive - there's a lot of poetry there.
- The process of writing a novel begins with a pang, a moment of recognition, and a situation, a character, or something you read in a paper, that seems to go off, like a solar flare inside your head.
- People ask me if I ever thought of writing a children's book. I say, 'If I had a serious brain injury I might well write a children's book', but otherwise the idea of being conscious of who you're directing the story to is anathema to me, because, in my view, fiction is freedom and any restraints on that are intolerable.
- Very broadly, literature concerns itself with the internal, cinema with the external.
- Every writer hopes or boldly assumes that his life is in some sense exemplary, that the particular will turn out to be universal.
- It is very difficult, it is perhaps impossible, for someone who loves his mother to love the woman whom your father left her for.
- Watching an adaptation of your novel can be a violent experience: seeing your old jokes suddenly thrust at you can be alarming. But I started to enjoy 'Money' very quickly, and then I relaxed.
