- My mantra is 'stay perpendicular.' Horizontal is not as good.
- I'm certainly not going to play any of Matt Damon's roles in the future. But he will eventually grow into mine, since he'll be around for a long time.
- Dialogue is what a character's willing to share and reveal to another character, and the 90% they aren't willing to share is what I do for a living.
- A film is not going to change the world. But if it can do that to individuals on an individual level, I think it's a magnificent movie.
- You have to be crazy to do theater.
- Subliminally, I had always wanted to act. Although I had only performed in a couple of plays, I was serious about it and was subsequently trained by people like Lee Strasberg and Elia Kazan.
- They were like little palaces: all rococo or art deco. You'd walk in off those hot streets into a nice, air-cooled theater, and you'd spend all day watching Cagney or Jimmy Stewart. It cost all of 17 cents.
- I'm usually cast by people who are oddly goofy.
- I've got two daughters, and it's impossible for me to say one of them is a favorite.
- A lot of the time with an independent production, you go onto the set, and you rehearse it in front of the crew, and at that point, the cinematographer takes over. You start accommodating the camera instead of the camera accommodating you.

- I played a wide variety of roles.
- I love to see lack of clarity in a performance as well as clarity, as well as trust, as well as the kinds of things that human beings go through. I love to see spontaneity and 'inevitability.' How it gets there is going to shock the hell out of me, but it will get there somehow.
- How a character hides his feelings tells us something about him.
- I've always been interested in science fiction.
- As a Jew, there's a need to keep that atrocity alive. There were Catholics and gypsies and homosexuals who died in the Holocaust, too. It's amazing that people allowed this slaughter to take place. There's a need to make these films and reiterate it happened.
- I always tried to play the bad guys as guys who didn't know they were bad guys. There are villains we run into all the time, but they don't think they are doing anything wrong. If they do, they think they are cunning and smart. When people break laws and ethical rules, they justify it in their own terms.
- I look for roles where there is some kind of an arc to the story.
- 'Mission' was a mind game. The ideal mission was getting in and getting out without anyone ever knowing we were there.

- People do not necessarily reveal what is going on - only bad actors do.
- Great teachers are the ones who inspire you.
- I could play a lot of things. And it's hard for people and logically hard and understandably hard for people to think of me for certain roles.
- I've always felt, pound for pound, I'm one of the best guys around; but you get stuck in people's eyes in a certain way, and it takes an imaginative director who will look at you and realize you can play different kinds of parts because you are an actor.
- A good director makes a playground and allows you to play.

- I don't know anybody who's any good who isn't nuts.
- I've turned down a lot of roles. Some of them made stars out of the people. I have no regrets.

- In any age range, there are some limitations in terms of good, good parts.
- I always say, if I tell you a joke right now and it's funny, you laugh. Now, we set the lights, and I tell you the joke again, it's hard to find it funny the second time.
- Everything that has happened to me is of value to me. As painful as certain things are, and have been, and were, there's a use for those things in my life and in my work.

- I was offered the Gene Hackman role in 'The Poseidon Adventure' four times, and I turned it down four times. I didn't want to do that movie. I called it the upside down boat.
- I don't like to do what I call 'the grunters' - a character who sits at a table and grunts and young people make fun of. I turn a lot of those down.
- I studied with Strasberg, Elia Kazan. They raised the bar. They weren't easy to please, and they made you achieve the best you could do. That's what a teacher does: he infuses you with passion for something.

- Teachers are important in this world.
- There are not many A-list directors who get to make the movies they want to make. I know two: Woody Allen and Tim Burton. Two different textures, but both get to do what they want, and that's rare.

- I can take scripts directly to actors. Agents don't like to hear that.
- Human beings are fascinating with religion and stories about not dying. Or dying and being brought back to life. I think it's just part of our make up.
