- One of the frustrating things for people who miss the first rally in a bull market is that they wait for the big correction, and it never comes. The market just keeps climbing and climbing.
- The problem with most people who play the market is that they are not flexible.
- Success means making profits and avoiding losses.
- Generally, a rising trend in rates is bearish for stocks; a falling trend is bullish.
- Monetary conditions exert an enormous influence on stock prices. Indeed, the monetary climate - primarily the trend in interest rates and Federal Reserve policy - is the dominant factor in determining the stock market's major direction.
- Big money is made in the stock market by being on the right side of the major moves. The idea is to get in harmony with the market. It's suicidal to fight trends. They have a higher probability of continuing than not.
- Basically, what I do is place a stop, generally 10 to 20 percent below the current price, whenever I buy a stock. The exact level depends on my own analysis of a stock's trading pattern. If a stock violates this stop, I'm out.
- The trend is your friend.
