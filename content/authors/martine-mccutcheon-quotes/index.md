- There are times when I'm so bored with being healthy and organic that I crave sugar and additives.
- For me, the show must go on - it doesn't matter how ill you are, you get on and do it.
- When I was younger, I used to look at movie stars with pencil-thin noses and think about a nose job. I've got a grown-up baby nose; it's not chiseled and structured. Then I saw how beautiful Audrey Tatou was in 'Amelie' and thought, 'She's got a nose like mine, and if she can have a baby nose, so can I.'
- I run or walk three times a week. I do Pilates, too, which is amazing - it makes you longer and leaner.
- A huge part of youth is how you behave: I'm always looking for fun and anything that makes me feel alive - that in itself keeps me feeling young.
- I eat foods such as fish, chicken, fruit and vegetables while avoiding red meat, dairy and wheat.
- If you're a man and you ask questions, you're a genius; if you're a woman, you're difficult.
- Any actress will tell you, when you've been given a starring role in the initial run of a show, you want to be getting the standing ovations every night, not just on review night.
- I've been told if you're an actress you can't sing, if you're a dancer you can't act, you can't do theatre and be respected if you've done a TV soap, you can't have a No. 1 record. All these different things they've told me I can't do, but I wanted to do them, so I've done them.
- Adele is great because she promotes the idea of being happy as you are.
- I've never pretended to be a supermodel.
- I believe love isn't simple, and it's one of the things that makes people break all the rules.
- I don't think for a second that I'm the best at anything, but I know I'm really good at quite a lot of things because I work hard.
- I want to make my mum's life and my life safe.
- I don't want to fly the flag for being unhealthy and overweight, but I don't want to fly the flag for being too thin, either.
- I've grown up in the public eye, and every decision I've made has always been so public and often inaccurately reported.
- I can't dance on ice, because I'm like Bambi on ice.
- I'm a Taurean, so I'm very passionate and determined and materialistic. Down the years, I've spent a lot of money and saved a bit of money and had a lot of fun.
- I never rule anything out. I'm an entertainer. Be it presenting, singing, acting, I just do things I love.
- I think you have to be careful not to do too much as yourself. Otherwise you stop getting the acting roles, and at the end of the day that's what I love.
- Any actress will tell you - it's really hard. If you're not an A-list Hollywood movie star, if you're in the middle, there are people who assume you wouldn't do certain things without even asking you, when actually you probably would. And there are people who always think you are busy doing something else.
- I look very different on camera compared with how I do in real life. On camera, I look my best when everything is enhanced, especially my eyes - I like a smoky eye. In real life, I like myself best in tinted moisturiser, lip balm and mascara.
- Eating lighter makes you lighter. No one can wave a magic wand.
- It's taken a while, but I've finally grown up and got my head around the fact that the healthier the food you eat is and the more exercise you do, the lighter you'll be. It really is that simple.
- I think it takes time to find your natural style and learn not to be swayed by trends that might not flatter you.
- I love nice things - I consider Ralph Lauren sheets to be a necessity, not a luxury - but I've known what it's like to be poor.
