- 'The Villain' gets off on the idea of disgusting the crowd and then telling the crowd to keep the noise down while he does it. The reason it works is because it comes at a point in matches where the anxiety shows.
- I've always had an awesome relationship with New Japan.
- What excited me about Ring Of Honor, again, was that promotion is based, for the most part, on in-ring action. And I felt like I, as this character, I feel like it has so much potential to do some really great things and touch people more than any pro wrestling match could.
- I've pinched things from people I look up to, of course, like Roddy Piper, and CM Punk, and Terry Funk, those guys who I love, so of course it's going to happen.
- As a wrestler in the world, traveling is a big part of it.
- I started in November of 2016, during the UK tour and it's been great. What I really like about ROH is how the company is built around the in-ring product, and obviously there are a lot of glitz and glamour as well, but it's pretty much based on what goes on in the ring.
- Most of the jobs I had when I was younger, I got fired from. I never had the attention span.
- ROH has been a great home for me. I've had some of my greatest wrestling experiences here. To me it has potential to be everything wrestling should be.
- I'm always going to work best, I think, doing things on my own. In terms of WWE, great company, I'm not sure if that's ever something that I would really want to do.
- It's been a real sort of juxtaposition in my life because I've gone from wrestling for the past 15/16 years to this new role where I'm essentially running a wrestling company so, during the week, where I used to train and work out and go tan, now I'm working 24 hours a day.
- I can be the best Villain. If I make the Villain different and unique to a point where no-one else can do it, that's where people are going to want me.
- For those in America, ITV is the biggest channel in the UK and they are getting wrestling on that station on New Year's Eve.
- I'd love to follow in Bryan Danielson's footsteps in Ring of Honor and go even further, then get knighted by the queen, which I shall do.
- 'The Villain' doesn't really have any heroes, as such, but as someone I looked up to more than anyone else and was influenced by, it was the 'American Dragon' Bryan Danielson.
- If you've got two great companies, rather than going at it head to head, let's work together and, at the end of the day, that's gonna be best for business for everyone, but most importantly the fans.
- The great thing with wrestling, independent wrestling more considerably, is that you can be who you want to be. There's no-one there to tell you what to do.
- I've always had a saying, 'Change is good.' I don't shy away from it, I embrace it. Make the most out of everything. Sometimes change is a blessing in disguise.
- I feel like me coming to ROH, I can help the company grow, and I can help take it to places it's never been before.
- When ROH came to me, they made it very clear they wanted me on their team. It wasn't a case of them finding me, I chose them. I knew they were the company for me.
- My whole act, my music, it's different; no-one does what I can do.
- I kind of knew already what kind of company ROH is, and I know the platforms that they give their guys, and for me it was very important to have that kind of freedom. Obviously, I let ROH know that was the case.
- If I want to turn up to the NWA and cause some noise, that's exactly what I'm going to do.
- I've really enjoyed working with Brody King and PCO, and offering a different side of 'The Villain' to the audience.
- The national treasure, Nick Aldis calls himself the real world's champion. Back earlier this year in the Crockett Cup, I gave Nick Aldis the fight of his life. Not just of his career, but of his life. And even though I came up short in that match, I know deep down in my heart, what is left of my broken heart, that I can breat you, Nick.
- I've been wrestling for a long time and it was time to do something new and set a new challenge for myself. ROH have always been amazing to me, and I'm very grateful for the opportunity to be more involved.
- A lot of wrestlers could be better off with getting off of social media to be fair.
- The only thing I'm concentrating on doing is becoming world heavyweight champion.
- Then I see tweets saying it's a shame that they can't watch Marty on the WWE UK show tournament. Then I tell them that I am on ROH, so watch that. Watch me wrestle some of the best wrestlers in the world.
- I'll be an independent contractor and I'm going to make sure that I am my own boss, that I pick my own hours. I'm going to make my own business decisions.
- Ring Of Honor has always been about young, hungry talent, and going out there and leaving it all in the ring.
- I'm the most versatile wrestler on the planet.
- I had good grades in school, but I was always in trouble. I used to get suspended and I'm not very good at being told what to do.
- Wrestling fans always want something new, they hate constantly going back to the well.
- I always think it's unique how you can have a show in a venue, and had a collection of different talent from all over the world, different backgrounds, different cultures, and all come together to put on this amazing show called pro wrestling.
- Obviously I have made much more of an impact than Ospreay has in Ring Of Honor, but I've made more of a splash than Ospreay.
- Daniel Bryan is the reason I wanted to come to Ring of Honor. I watched all those years and saw his body of work in Ring of Honor, and it appealed to me so much.
- I've never been one to want to stay the same. Quite the opposite, I relish the chance to be different and unique.
- If I make history, I don't need to blab about it. My first concern is not 'making history,' it's myself and becoming world champion. That's all I care about.
- The WWE has the largest amount of eyes on it and is the biggest wrestling company in the world. It would be a huge honor for myself to work there, but am I going to be given the same 'Villain' mic time?
- I have the best entrance in all of professional wrestling for crying out loud.
- My character is very organic and an authentic representation of who I am as a person at the time. As a 28-year-old, I'm different as a man than I was as an 18-year-old. As you grow as a human being, the character evolves.
- Wrestling is my passion and that's something I embrace. The wrestling world needs me and I'm going to enjoy it.
- I'm creatively driven to create a body of work. I was made to put on this Earth to wrestle and perform. Create a legacy, create this Villain persona to put down in the history books for people to watch for many years to come.
- The Villain wasn't necessarily something I sat down and thought, 'Oh this is going to be my character.' It's most like other great wrestling characters, where it's more of a reflection of my actual character.
- I thought Ring Of Honor didn't have any British guys. And I can come to Ring Of Honor and not only have they not seen anyone like me before, there's not anyone that can talk like me, wrestle like me, see my character is pretty unique, so that was important for me.
- It's all very well to go out there and put on an exciting match, while some of my matches are the most exciting out there, but having a character like mine that people can relate with is very important. I feel like that is a good reason why my character has worked.
- Wrestling is about connecting with the audience. Giving them a reason to care. Same reason I binge watch series on Netflix, because the stories and characters get me invested.
- As a business man running a huge enterprise, it wouldn't be smart for me to discuss my potential business decisions with a journalistic tabloid. That being said, I certainly aim to make waves in the wrestling world, and continue to raise Villain Enterprises stock through the roof.
- I like to do everything to the best and to the extreme, and for me that's a big part of why I came to Ring Of Honor.
