- Whether looking at pop music, hip-hop or R&B, it's rare to find an artist who hasn't been touched or affected by the power and soul of gospel music. In fact, many of today's popular artists such as Whitney Houston, John Legend, and Katy Perry started their careers in the church choir.

- My assignment is to take my situation and to use it to help others who feel hopeless and/or helpless because of loss.
- D.C. is one my largest audiences. They buy tons of records of mine in Washington, D.C.
- Sometimes I still wonder what my fans look like, but if I had to describe them, I'd say that they are everyday people with everyday needs who need a supernatural message to help them though their natural walk.
- Our job in gospel is not going away. It's a sustainable genre. It sells - without question.
- I understand now that God trusts me enough to give me three kids - Marvin Jr., Mikaila and Madisson - who totally depend on me. They know I'm going to be there for them no matter what.
