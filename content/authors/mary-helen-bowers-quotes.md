- I want my workouts to feel like a luxury, a way to pamper yourself and add a beautiful dimension to your everyday life.
- A lot of fitness has that very masculine energy and drive, and that never worked for me. I want to be challenged. I don't want to be told that I'm terrible and that I suck and that I'm not good enough - that's not motivating.

- I like to customize my tights by cutting them myself to create a stirrup or convert the look into a capri.

- I think being in the right mindset is a huge challenge for women, who often take an all-or-nothing approach to working out or eating well.
- The image of a pregnant woman embracing her figure and really putting it out there can be scary to some people, but I don't let that stand in my way, and I don't think other women should either.
- For a ballerina, the center of balance is everything - creating a strong center of balance begins with building strong abdominal muscles.
- Generally, I snack on lots of fresh fruit and raw nuts, such as almonds.
- I became completely obsessed with body oils while pregnant.
- A lot of people think the body is just about genetics, but the right approach can change its shape.
- By continuing to work out and dance while pregnant, I feel a double reward from maintaining my normal routine but all the while knowing that baby is sharing in my day.
- Sometimes people feel really trapped by the body that they have. Women are told, 'You have this body shape; you're a pear or string bean, and you can't change the way you look.' That's just not true.
- Generally speaking, I love a workout that includes stretching and toning exercises for legs and core on the mat paired with ballet-inspired cardio and Barre exercises to get the heart rate up and take the results to the next level.

- It's not about having a perfectly sculpted figure; it's about feeling healthy, fit, and confident.
- I've learned that there are many people out there who want to feel powerful and strong on their own terms, who want to tune out the noise and the punishing nature of grueling workouts.

From there, I continued to build and expand the method itself along with the business, always looking for ways to share the workout with others around the world.

- You won't find me in a sports bra and low-slung leggings.
- Ballet can be hard on your joints, and when you're on a movie set doing take after take, it can become really repetitive.
- I've been so fortunate to have had such a healthy, easy pregnancy and have been incredibly active the entire way through. My favorite part is feeling the baby move - but the entire process is such a miracle.
- When you're not experiencing your food, that's when it's harder to pay attention to when you're full, and that's what being satisfied really means.
- A lot of fitness is about contractions - you're doing squats, or you're on a bike and your knees are bending but never stretching all the way, so your muscles get strengthened but look short and thick.
- I'm very sensitive to salt. I always see and feel a big difference in my body when I eat it, so I try to consume salt in moderation.
- With ballet, you're really focused on the inner thigh and butt and just lifting and lengthening everything, including your arms. You're not using weights, but holding up the weight of your own arms is a challenge.
- Stretching before and after every workout keeps muscles supple and helps elongate the lines of a ballerina's limbs.

- Before founding Ballet Beautiful, I was a ballerina with the New York City Ballet.
- I love berries, greens, and salmon.
- The muscles that are used in Ballet Beautiful are similar to those used in classic ballet. They're also muscles that don't get used very often, which is why it burns so much.
- I think most people don't need as much cardio as they think they do.
- I'll buy a special occasion dress even if I don't know when or where I'll wear it.
- I had the opportunity to train with Natalie Portman for 'Black Swan,' and the program we created was intense and involved a lot of travel.
- I find that the thing that makes every body look the best is great toning, and really, really targeting the muscles, and low cardio, where you're sculpting and getting your heart rate up but not beating yourself up.
- It definitely wasn't cool in junior high, when everyone else is trying out for cheerleading, to have a life consumed by ballet.
