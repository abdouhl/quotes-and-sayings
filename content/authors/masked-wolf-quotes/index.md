- If you don't seize that moment you sort of fall behind and get left in the smoke, so it's full steam ahead.
- I mean, the whole point of 'Astro' was to speak more about myself and open up, which was something I wasn't really doing in life.
- It's always important for me to say something with my music, even if the deeper message is hidden inside of what sounds like a fun, upbeat song.
- Everyone has their own battles, people feel bad all the time for different reasons. For me it was feeling depressed, anxious and out of place. But I wanted to give people something that could sit with them on their own personal level.
- I could've given up on music and stuck with my day job. But I chose to work hard and articulate my sound. I look back on that time and I think to myself: I used it wisely.
- I liked my job and I loved my boss, but every morning when I got in that suit it was like, oh man. I felt like I was meant to be in hip-hop clothes. I'm supposed to be in that astronaut suit up in space, you know what I mean?
- When you don't have a lot of views, it can feel like nobody cares about you. But it's not necessarily that. It's just that the industry is super tough. You need to find that moment and when you find that moment, or you have that song, you've got to capitalise on it.

- I always said I just wanted to be an artist that made like $500 a week from music and anything on top would be a bonus, so everything that's happened to me now is unreal. Like, I really can't believe it. It's like when you watch a Netflix show and the main character becomes a superhero; I feel like I became a superhero.
- So I don't know what the world's doing to me at the moment. I'm just on the surfboard. The wave's there, and I'm just going along with it, wondering when the wave's gonna stop and just enjoying the sun.
- I used to just say I'm in sales. I couldn't be bothered telling people I do music. But now if I don't say I do music, I'm lying. Because that's my only job.
- Ever since I was like 13 and 14 writing music, I said, I have to be able to do different types. Because if you just keep doing the same thing over and over again, it will just get boring.
- If we met today and you had no idea who I was, you'd just think I was a normal guy. You wouldn't think I'm a rapper.
