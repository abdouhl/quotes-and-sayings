- You know, I started doing movies. I mean, my mind was brought into saying, 'You know what? I want to build a generation of wealth.'
- I think my thing is I grew up in the ghetto, and I was able to get a second chance. That's what I'm trying to tell kids.
- I think you've got good people and bad people in everything you do. If you start making a big deal of it, then it's a problem. It's like in life. We've got bad doctors and lawyers. We've got bad priests! We don't target every priest and say he's bad. You have to go to church and you have to go see some doctors. Some people have to be good.
- Television is not like making records. I wanna tell all you kids, do not try this at home, 'cause it's hard. It takes a lot of hard work, a lot of practice, and a lot of different takes.
- Work hard and never make excuses.
- I think everybody has a good and bad side.
- If I can go through what I've been through and do a television show with my son and then be a boy from the hood making records for the people I make records for, that's reality.
