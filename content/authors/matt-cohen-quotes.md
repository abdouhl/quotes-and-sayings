- I wanted to play football all my life, and when I got accepted to Florida State, it was academically - it wasn't for any kind of scholarship. I kind of sat down and said, 'I'm not going to make it to the NFL. I'm not the size nor the skill.'
- I work out seven days a week, and I love every minute of it. It really is a way just to get away. I weight train and do cardio and stay active as much as possible every day; I have to just to clear my head. I love to get into the gym.
- These 'Supernatural' conventions are such a great time. The fan base is like none other, and I'm sure I'll never experience a fan base that support is the same with - their kind of unbridled decency towards the actors makes me not have to worry about going into the crowd.
- I don't do a lot of dating. I guess it's kind of like everyone is always trying to set me up with somebody, so we go out and hang out at a club or somewhere. I think dates are weird.
- Everything about a date is weird, especially if it's a new person you don't really know. You want to take them somewhere you think they're going to like, but you don't want to ask that question because you want to look like you're in control of the situation. So I think dates are just weird in general.
- There is nothing like watching the woman you are in love with make a baby, make a miracle! It is one hell of a ride, and I am only seven months in. Time is flying by, but I am taking it all in. It is the most important thing that I have ever been a part of in my life.
- I played football all my life throughout high school and ran track.
- I welcome newcomers to cons, or 'con-virgins' as I like to call them, by saying 'Welcome to the 'Supernatural' Circus,' and I mean it. We take pride as a cast to deliver a show that not only entertains the fans but ourselves, Creation Entertainment, and everyone involved on both sides.
- I'd always told people that I would have liked to pursue some sort of professional fight career. I don't know if I'm quite right for it, since I'm extremely prone to injury. I've been boxing for a couple years, and I've messed around with some Jiu-Jitsu, and I've always felt that there's such a passion in a real fighter's heart.
- I am a great motivator. I have struggles in my life, and the only way I can push through them is to motivate others. It really is quite selfish.
- I designed a tattoo for a girl once, and she got it, which I thought was pretty cool. We no longer speak. She'll always remember me, though - I can guarantee that.
