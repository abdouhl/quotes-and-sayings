- Reality is, you have to work harder the older you get.
- Coaches coach guys on the field. I get to spend time with practice squad receivers and tight ends or a young center who's always inactive on Sundays... I feel really good about having an impact on those guys and their careers.
- It's definitely hard when you're putting in the work and the guy who's starting isn't, especially if he's overhyped or you're not winning. I can't imagine how hard it would be to be that guy's backup.
- Arm strength, I think, is a thing that's, like, incredibly overrated in the NFL.
- I would say I'm very surprised it went down the way it did. I thought it was a possibility, but when I left for vacation, I definitely didn't think I would come back as not a member of the Titans. But we had a difference of the opinion somewhere along the way.
