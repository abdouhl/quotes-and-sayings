- I worked for a breakfast catering company on commercial shoots, which meant getting up at 3 or 4 A.M. and loading up your car with a bunch of food and driving out to some set in Santa Clarita and making breakfast for a bunch of people.
- From the first audition on stage, I knew I loved acting.
- I was offered the role of the Reverse Flash on 'The Flash' by Executive Producer Andrew Kreisberg and Greg Berlanti, who co-created the series with Andrew. I said 'yes' immediately because I had worked with those guys before on the show 'Eli Stone.'
- I have a mind that always wants to be busy.
- To go straight to 'Scandal' and get to play the larger-than-life guy who has the page-long rants and gets drilled in the leg with blood flying everywhere, it was a blast. It's really been a nice counterpoint after the first season of 'The Carrie Diaries.'
- Nobody wants to hear me sing! I can sing, but nobody wants to be there for it.
- 'Carrie Diaries' is very heartfelt and earnest in a lot of ways.
- I am always really respectful of anything that has the kind of longevity and fan base that something like DC Comics has and 'The Flash' series in particular has.
- I was not a comic book kid.
- I'm really drawn to chameleons; I'm really drawn to people who can play a wide range of roles, who are really versatile, but are so in a way that's with ease.
- My first movie was 'The Mask Of Zorro,' and that was all swords and horses and swashbuckling, and I thought, 'This is what movies are.' Obviously, I never made another one like that again; those are very rare.
- Your tenacity is a larger deciding factor in your success than however good or bad an actor you may be. I feel like that's just something that cannot be overstated enough for people getting into the business. You have to really want it more than anybody else.
- Sadly, in the most nerdy way possible, my superpower is anagramming.
- During my senior year, when I was attending the University of Michigan and getting a drama degree, the Purple Rose Theatre was in its second season. The year before was the company's inaugural season. I, of course, wanted to work there. It was started by a really prominent local actor, Jeff Daniels.
- In terms of preparation, if there's some historical context that's needed, I do like to read a lot. Working on Joe Kennedy for 'Boardwalk,' I read a couple of biographies on him. It's nice to have a broader context of the man outside of where the show is coming from.
- As an actor, you are always waiting for someone else to be able to tell you when it's okay to work, and as a writer, you can just pick up your computer and start whenever you want. That is really freeing.
- I don't want to infringe on Alec Baldwin's territory, but I'm a pretty darn good 'Words With Friends' player.
- Why would anybody say no to somebody's happiness?
- I've resigned myself to the fact that the world needs clowns, too, and I was born to be one of them. And it is an important role in our society to play.
- I've had enough rejection for multiple lifetimes.
- The ban on assault weapons was a good and necessary law that was allowed to lapse through the influence of special interests.
- You especially want to strive for that nuance on a show like 'The Flash,' which is different from 'Legends' in the sense that it's really, at its heart, a smaller show. It's a more intimate show, in a way.
