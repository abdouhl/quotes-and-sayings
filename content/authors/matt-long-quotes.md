- I wasn't athletic. I played baseball, but I was terrible.
- I was a conservative kid, but I had fun. I was in a fraternity and stuff. I wasn't a player - that's for sure.
- I would hate to be 65 and think, 'What if I had tried to be an actor?'
- There was a time I thought about being a professional guide. I'm a big outdoorsman, but the acting thing has always been there - always something I wanted to do.
- I see myself being married to my girlfriend and backpacking all over the world. If I can go out and do a 15-mile hike and climb a 12,000-ft. peak, I'm good to go.
