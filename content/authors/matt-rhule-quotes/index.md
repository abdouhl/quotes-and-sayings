- I don't just get bogged down in, 'I want to win.' There's something even greater than that. And that's the way that you play the game. I want to play beautiful football. That's our purpose: to go out and play the game at the highest level, play it the right way.
- There are a lot of high school coaches out there who could coach in college or the NFL.
- People always say you've had success as a head coach, and really it's Phil Snow who has been with me the whole time.
- You always have an eye to the future but you always honor the past.
- Baylor has stood here before the state of Texas was even formed. It will be here for a long time. It hit a rough time, but this is what Baylor stands for. It stands for excellence and leadership and service and a spiritual mission.
- Some mistakes in life you can come back from. Harming someone else is something different. With my own team, we're never going to harm someone that's weaker than us.
- I count my friends in my life by the people who are there when you need them.
- I'm a little long-winded. My dad is a preacher, my mom is Italian, so I come by it naturally.

- There's a lot to accomplish at Baylor. And most importantly, it's just each and every year, I want to put together a championship-caliber team.
- To me, I think we want an organization that's aligned. We want an organization that has the same vision. But we don't want an organization that all has the same ideas. We want people that are willing to argue, fight, scratch and claw, but everyone is working together.
- There's people that believe tempo is the star. There's people who believe the system is the star. There's people that believe the players are the stars. I come from that mindset.
- It's probably the ethos of our program - like, you learn from the past but never dwell on the past. It's just a mindset of we don't wallow, we don't worry... we just attack.
- One thing people don't realize is coaches, we pick up our families. We rip them out of their homes. We rip them out of the places that they are. Sometimes you do that until you get to a point where you find happy. You shouldn't mess with happy.
- My wife and I had watched 'Fixer Upper' so much, that was my introduction. I had this image in my mind of what Waco was based upon that show.
- I don't tolerate people being disrespectful or bullyish to each other. You can't hurt women. You can't hurt people that are less fortunate than you. You can't bully other people.
- I'm supportive of social justice.
- Obviously, like anything else, I have views on how we should play defense but I don't call the defensive plays. I have views on how I want us to run our offense but I don't call our offensive plays. It's in collaboration with Phil Snow, with Joe Brady, with all of our coaches.
- I'm not going to sit here and tell you that I'm perfect in every way, but I do know this. I'm a Christian man, and I go where God tells me to go. I do what God tells me to do, as best as I can.
- I'm always looking three, four, five years down the line.
