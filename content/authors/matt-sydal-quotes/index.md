- At WSX I think I was very much trying to figure it out on my own and we were creating our own style and our own thing. I can only speak for myself, I was not trying to be anything. I was not trying to be like anyone else.
- There is this energy, a lifeblood energy that runs through Ring of Honor.
- Of course, I was an insane ECW fan. You don't get this deep into wrestling unless you are obsessed with wrestling so that was the final hook.
- Now I think a lot of wrestlers want to get signed so that way they can be with a company where they can learn, but they're really kind of looking for a contract, and I do think that makes sense.
- All the people who were on WSX Season 1 are the life blood of the alternative wrestling business, and now the mainstream wrestling business as well. That is what Lucha Underground is doing.
- You have to realize WWE's contract. They're not getting paid from advertising money. USA makes that money. WWE gets paid by USA, they get paid a lot of money, and the money increases every year. Ratings aren't the most important thing to them.
- I was down in Peru, and I was watching AAA in Spanish on my TV, and it just it blew my mind because they weren't following any of the rules, yet the crowd was still there.
- You know I'd be all about that if there were guys who could take my place as a babyface but there is no one that can step into my shoes. There's no one who can do what I do.
- Let's face it: when we were crazy into wrestling, there were 20 million people on Monday nights watching wrestling. So what you have are 17 million lagged wrestling fans. People who connect to it somewhere, but haven't really found an inspiration or a cultural connection to it.
- I am in a closed state where I'm just reacting and moving based on my instincts, knowledge, technique and years of experience.
- Brodie Lee would be a match I'd love to have. When he was the TNT Champion, I was sort of hoping to work my way up to that level.
- The hardest thing to do in wrestling is that every time you show up, there's just a ring with three ropes, turnbuckles on each side, it's extremely hard to do something to surprise and shock the fans.
- There are ties that began when I was just a young kid trying to cut my teeth in the business. I would drive 14 hours to wrestle on a Ring of Honor show that I didn't even get paid 20 dollars for.
- I'm the best Crusierweight, X Division, Junior Heavyweight wrestler whatever you want to call it.
- There are so many people in Ring of Honor and so much talent. It was almost intimidating to be thrown back in with this wealth of talent.
- When I was working for WWE I felt like I was trying to make someone else's vision happen instead of my own. And I think that's where I became less true to myself and I think it showed in my work.
- I'm always impressed when fans' knowledge surpasses me.
- I was creating content that I had in my head and I was making it in the ring and WSX was giving me an opportunity, an uninhibited opportunity, to create and manufacture my vision for wrestling for other people.
- I am not like any other wrestler.
- It may not be the most popular thing online, but I believe in what I'm doing. I believe in what I'm creating at my dojo.
- When I began in Ring of Honor, I was very fortunate to get on shows and get looked at and get the experience. I was working with a ton of guys who had more experience than me at the time, like AJ Styles and Christopher Daniels.
- I run my wrestling school, SyDojo, I do independent wrestling events all over the world.
- I have a little dojo in Clearwater called the Sai Dojo and I've just been putting in extra work there and so, when I get a chance to wrestle now, my comfort level in the ring is higher, my skills are sharper and I just felt like I couldn't have a better time to get these huge opportunities.
- Whether I am the Champion or not is irrelevant to me. I am not attached to it.
- I don't really pay attention to WWE stuff as it's just not for me.
- I loved wrestling when you had to get a VHS tape from a strange.
- Wrestling has become its own thing separate from what it was in the past and now when people think of pro wrestlers they don't think of Hulk Hogan, they're thinking of guys like me.
- Me and my girlfriend make all my costumes here ourselves at home.
- I do work for Impact Wrestling, but I'm just a straight up freelance agent in wrestling. I can work for anybody at any time. Basically every company calls me up.
- Evan Bourne is a ship that has sailed but if he wound up back at WWE, I'm imagine I'd run back to that name because of copyright ownership stuff.
- Impact is just always improving at all angles. There is a lot of creativity and thought that goes into everything.
- The Japanese style, they really do have concern for their neighbors kind of more than themselves.
- There's room for five or six of these federations because people love wrestling.
- I always love the locker rooms that I end up in.
- You can catch me following good wrestlers wherever they are.
- If you're just trying to get by, you're going to be left behind. The caliber of shows I'm on are incredible, and it makes me just want to raise that bar even more.
- I use the right hemisphere of my brain and what I have is this advantage that makes me exceedingly interesting in pro wrestling.
- I worked extremely hard and dedicated my life to pro wrestling but the more I grow in ways not related to work, my work grows.
- At WSX the message was loud and clear consistently, even as a rookie signing a contract and kind of talking about things and getting into the nitty-gritty details. I felt like I was always given a lot of respect and in fact sometimes I thought they were almost tooting my own horn too loud I thought it was almost silly.
- For me, as much fun as it is to watch wrestling is, actually wrestling is what struck a chord with me.
- Locker rooms always evolve with the wrestlers that are in it.
- For me, I'm not trying to be the flavor for everybody. But I'm just proud when people I respect or people that I want to be my fans are my fans.
- The internet has given pure equality to everyone. The cream rises to the top. It is the era of not take a job, but create your own job.
- It's more about the feeling and how you felt when it was going on. Were you laughing with your friends? Were you having a good time? That's what makes wrestling good. It's not the wrestling itself. It's the experience that people have.
- I wouldn't want to go see a comedian if he was using the same jokes. So I'm not going out there trying to do the same thing that and my body's changed, my life's changed and really if people have already seen me do something a 1,000 times, 1,001 is not going to impress anybody.
- When you're in the Ring of Honor locker room, you feel like something special is happening every night.
- Scientology is completely irrelevant to any of the talks that have been given to me.
- People try and make it a big deal, but a show's a show, work's work, if you haven't wrestled in New York in a couple months, it's always good to take a booking there because there's a lot of great wrestling fans up there.
- When I was at IMPACT and X Division Champion, my neck wasn't able to handle the workload and after losing the belt to Brian Cage in a match I just realized my neck just can't handle this anymore.
- I always stand behind the things that I do. I don't listen to those who downplay things nor do I pay attention to those who grovel at our feet and tell us that we're the greatest. For me, that is just noise.
- I've been living this extraordinary life with a new enlightened perspective, to see things from a higher perspective. I feel like I'm able to see things from that higher perspective at Impact Wrestling right now where there are unlimited opportunities and room for growth and to make some work I can really be proud of.
- For the last two years, since I left IMPACT in 2018, I've spent basically the last two years just trying to be healthy, be strong, be ready for when that opportunity comes and I sort of felt like that's what I've been putting into the universe.
- The thing I noticed most from challenging from country to country is not the differences but the similarities. Wrestling fans are all the same.
- I mean I imagine I could have done a better job with keeping my paperwork and paying my taxes. For the most part, everything happened exactly the way it should.
- When I'm out there, it's not even me who is doing the acting and the wrestling and the moving. It is something that I feel like I see channels more than anything else. So, for me, I tune into the right frequency. I get turned on and we're ready for take off.
- WWE was pretty wonderful to me because I was able to rehab my foot 100 percent before I was released.
- Of course I am not going to be the favorite pick of everybody. That's because some people don't see things from my perspective.
- I always wanted to be the worst wrestler on the shows I was on so I could just learn from the guys above me, and that's a great way to be in your first few years of wrestling.
- I can know what Brian Cage is doing before he's doing it because he's doing me. I've been facing the man in the mirror my entire life. That's been my hardest battle is the one where it's me versus me.
- I remember when I had just left WWE and I was wrestling in England and Germany, I could just tell that this influx of this new wave of wrestling was coming much like it felt when I began wrestling back in '99.
- I don't wanna say I'm anti-military as my mission is the exact opposite and I'm a unifying force. I'm there to show everybody that we're all the exact same.
- Triple H was so generous to me with his time and his knowledge when I was like the young up-and-comer wrestling Chavo, and every life event, after our matches, he would come back and give me just a list of things to work on which is exactly what I see going on in NXT, like how they're adopting a high-flyer style to the WWE audience.
- So, I can't tell you the mentality behind the stuff, because that's thousands of hours manifested into one moment, maybe in the shower or driving down the road that the idea comes and the genius strikes and sometimes, it happens moments before you go to the ring.
- That is why I can never walk away from wrestling because there's this moment - the bell rings and everything slips away. The path, the future. There's nothing but that moment right in front of you where the intensity is high, the risk and reward are high, and you have to enter into a mental state that doesn't allow for hesitation.
- I'm always supportive of my brothers who have the guts to step in the cage. Pro wrestling is dangerous but it takes a special kind of courage to lock yourself in a cage that wants to do you harm.
- I was just lucky to be there ahead of the curve to be the driving force behind bringing this amazing style of wrestling from Japan that combined Lucha Libre, American professional wrestling, Canadian professional wrestling and Japanese wrestling all into one beautiful mix that fans worldwide absolutely can't get enough of.
- So I don't think one type of wrestling is right and one type of wrestling is wrong, and I've used that ability to unlearn what I've done and really go back and get back in touch with that Dragon Gate style since now there's a lot of guys that can work with that.
- It's just important for me to be healthy and just to take care of my body. Fans will appreciate the sacrifices we make with our bodies but I was just working a little more hurt than I should.
- Someone like Brian Cage, he's a gigantic man who is trying to wrestle like me. That's his mistake because I clearly hold the top card in someone who is wrestling like Matt Sydal.
- I'm out there to produce the best content - The most creative content I can do and express myself through wrestling.
- So I always respected the guys who were trying to do it on their own without taking a handout from a big organization. They were trying to create their own thing, the DIY style, which is sort of always been my style, kind of a makeshift survival mode and really just kind of forging your own path.
- I watch Dragon Gate, New Japan, NXT, AEW. I love the Lucha Bros, The Young Bucks. Mainly I watch the guys in the shows that I'm on.
- But I really think wrestling with pure intentions just wrestling to be a better wrestler, eventually you will get there when the time is right.
- I have taken every amount of creative liberty and freedom that I can get and I've actually managed to push it. I would say being the champion gives me that freedom because you really get a little more carte blanche.
- Mostly the guys I worked with like wrestling AJ Styles, Jamie Noble, wrestling Chavo Guerrero, wrestling Rey Mysterio... As much as I try to be an individual or unique I can't deny the strong effect these guys have all had on me.
- My first venture to Qatar was with WWE. It was an incredible tour and we stayed at a luxurious hotel. I ventured out by myself and wandered down to a shopping center and there was beautiful architecture everywhere.
- So, there's plenty of good heels in the business. I don't see guys who can get fans to rally behind them like I do. It's hard. It's the hardest job in the business and I'm doing it every single night.
- I've always been an independent wrestler at heart. You say I haven't had a 'home' but a company is not a home, a house is a home, a family is a home and I have that.
- You don't want to end up being an indie wrestler who wants to be the big fish in a small pond.
- For us, our stage is always what it is. It's not about reaching the broadest audience as it's about doing quality work.
