- Working with guys allowed me to at least understand guys in a way that I could then say to women, 'Look, here's what I've learned about men.'
- Think of your early dates as a chance to leave clues about your expectations with a little technique called pre-framing. Say: 'My friend gets annoyed because her boyfriend never opens the car door for her. It's a shame when guys don't do those little things.'
- If you label someone lazy or a liar, he'll feel like that for life. Worse, guys lose motivation to change when we feel like your perception of us is set in stone.
- Research shows that making eye contact is a powerful draw for guys - even in photos. Just don't mistake duck face for flirty.
- Choose a guy who has a similar level of drive as you. There's nothing sexy about being your boyfriend's life coach.
- I believe that if a guy doesn't offer to pay the whole thing when he asks you on a date, he wasn't taught right. But I also believe if a woman on a date allows him to pay for the whole thing without at least offering to pay half, she wasn't taught right.

- Quite simply, if someone tells you often that they're dreaming of, or thinking about, you, it means you're someone they see as a big part of their life. When you're in their head, it means you're also pretty close to their heart.

- He's more of a slob than you? Instead of condemning, state your standards: 'I need to live in a place that's clean. I respect that it's not a big deal to you, but it's important to me to enjoy my home.' This removes ego.
- Lose the group shot in front of the Eiffel Tower, where it's impossible to tell you from your friends. He's not going on a date with Paris or your entourage, he's going on a date with you and he wants to know what you look like.
- When someone feels truly in love, they feel certain. That means they lose any commitment-phobia and will want to find ways to bring you closer together.
- The truth is men like women who are challenging, and set them standards to live up too. Caveat: This doesn't mean he wants someone to neurotically pick at everything all the time.
- I once told a date, 'I love what you're wearing!' She replied, 'Aw, thanks. I've gotten so many compliments on it. Yours means the most though!' She didn't need to tell me guys were hitting on her - my imagination went there anyway.

- Women in their thirties are much more nervous about dating. They feel time is 'running out for them. They want to get married and have a family. The women I see in their forties and fifties know what they want. They are amazing, confident women with good jobs, but they are just struggling to find someone who is their equal.
- You invest in someone based on how much they invest in you.
- Just because someone isn't allowing you to pay for the date, it doesn't mean you can't contribute on some level. For example, if someone took you for dinner and a movie, they may have paid for the dinner, they may have paid for the movie tickets, but then you buy the popcorn.
- With any form of change, it's kind of like you're dislodging something. Once you've done it a little bit, you can open the floodgates.

- I don't think the idea of being seen changes in its importance. I think it's always true. When relationships start to have problems, it's almost always because we don't feel seen by that person anymore.

- One of the most overwhelming things about dating is imagining going on an entire dinner date for an evening with someone you don't even know you have chemistry with yet.

- Plenty of casual daters will throw you off with maddening phrases like 'I'm just enjoying having fun with you.' This doesn't make them a bad person, but it's your call now how to respond. Just don't assume 'having fun' or any such cliche means they're going to suddenly decide they want a relationship next week.
- We live in a very mollycoddled society where the slightest bit of discomfort is seen as wrong, but that discomfort is there for a reason.

- If you look like you're hiding something, we're more likely to swipe left.
