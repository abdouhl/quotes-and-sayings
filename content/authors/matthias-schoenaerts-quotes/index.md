- I'll let life take me where it will.
- Your appearance shouldn't define who you are, and that's what I like, the contrast between people looking like the opposite of what they truly are deep inside.
- I like underdogs, I like anti-heroes - people that have a hard time overcoming things in life.
- I'm just looking for touching characters.
- I hooked up with director Jacques Audiard for this film called 'Rust & Bone' with Marion Cotillard. I loved that experience so much I'm truly sad that it's over!
- I love being the underdog.
- Being human is being a lot of things at the same time.
- I don't like when people expect too much, because then I'll only be disappointed if things don't work out.
- We all get damned in our lives, and there are ripple effects. One thing can determine a life, and it's hard to overcome that if the event is really traumatic. Your life is completely condemned by it.
