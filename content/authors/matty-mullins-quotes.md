- I grew up in Spokane, Washington, in a very Christian, conservative home.
- I think - actually, I know - that I am, without a doubt, the world's worst drummer.
- We as humans are so imperfect. We are always looking for something more and always going astray from Jesus. Whether you believe in him or not, but he is always there with open arms. God never abandons you. He is always waiting for you to come back and when you do, you won't be scolded - you will be embraced.
- We are so proud of 'Unconditional'. I couldn't have been more honest in these songs, and I can't wait to see the impact they have. This record is exactly what it's supposed to be.
- I had gone through a really rough patch in my life, struggling with anxiety and depression for the first time ever, and it was totally new to me. I really had no idea what was going on, and it was all I could think about, so it was all I could write about.
- Progressive metal is one of the hardest styles of music to pull off live, especially while providing a tasteful show.
- At the beginning, my folks were pretty upset with the whole thing at first, the music, the tattoos - but after observing the music scene I'm in now for a couple of years, they totally get it - they actually love it. They are so proud. My dad actually flew to Japan to see us play. My mom comes to the shows near home in Washington.
- I do remember seeing Audio Adrenaline and The Newsboys, basically Christian rock, because that was what I was allowed to see by my parents.
- I was pretty sheltered growing up. I just started getting into heavier music with the Tooth & Nail/Solid State era, which really kind of brought this whole thing to life for me, so I am really thankful for that label.
