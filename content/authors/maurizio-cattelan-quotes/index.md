- Laughter is a Trojan horse to enter into direct contact with the unconscious, strike the imagination, and trigger visceral reactions.
- What's the point of our life? Everything seems absurd until we die, and then it makes sense.
- Provocations are like a Molotov cocktail. They only work one time out of ten, but when it works, it can also be dangerous for the arm that is throwing it. It's the price that has to be paid.
- I am not an artist.
- Damien Hirst knows how to drive super-fast cars... I love my bicycle.

- I produce so little that the works have to be editioned. Otherwise, I don't survive. Also, editioning is relevant for communication. If you make three new works, it means that nine objects are available. Three people talking about your work is fine, but nine makes a difference.
- Art is about forgetting all these feelings, good and bad, and trying to understand what acts will last longer, which symbols will remain in history. It's a question of perspective: The further you get from the past, the more concrete and plausible it seems.
- If you are searching to figure out what is true and what is not, you will have a sad life. It means you have too much time, and you should do a hobby - like collecting art.
- My aim is to be as open and as incomprehensible as possible. There has to be a perfect balance between open and shut.

- Truth is so hard to tell, it sometimes needs fiction to make it plausible.
- From my point of view, humour and irony include tragedy; they're two sides of the same coin.
- Stuffed animals are sad and scary; they have humorous and tragic qualities.
- I never talk about my work as a joke.
- I think that laughter and death are closely related: comedy is the quintessential human reaction to the fear of death. It's probably linked with the fact that we are the only animals who know we must die.
- Art should be able to be innovative without compromising itself. That's why I believe artists should have bigger preoccupations than checking the price tags on their work or becoming curators' darlings.
- I won't say I'm not fascinated by the way advertising works. I like the sleekness. But a picture in advertising doesn't last too long. They have to work for 30 seconds. And I'd like to reach at least two minutes. This is my goal: to break that two-minute record.

- I am fascinated by the idea of employing beautiful images as a device to convey something extremely disturbing in an apparently harmless way.

- Never give an artist like me carte blanche: he would think it's simply toilet paper.
- I would describe myself as a tallish, shy, middle-aged man who equally loves his work and his freedom. And a good liar!
- Gianni Agnelli was a sharp mind, and most of his interviews carried meanings between the lines that only now are fully readable.
- I get up in the morning and get to bed at night, and between, I bring equivalent dedication to everything I do, with a horror of the inaccurate and the half-baked.
- I like to produce work for specific places, and it is difficult to do repeat shows in the same space.

- It's even more of a torture not to work than to work.
- Every morning, we choose between milk or tea or coffee. Usually, I know what I like, but I don't rule out changing my idea sometimes. The editing process is one of the most important parts in everyday life. The same is with my work: mistakes are part of the decision-making process.
- Contemporary art will never achieve the audience of football, pop music, or television, so I think we should stop comparing its possible area of influence to that of big mass-media events.

- I'm terrorized by a fear of failure. Failure is always there.
- I would never make fun of anyone who is obviously disabled who cannot defend himself, like Donald Trump.
- I work more with my stomach than my brain.
- Art fairs are a lot like professional proms - you make contacts, have a lot to look at, and in some cases, you make friends forever.
