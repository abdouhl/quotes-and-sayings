- I don't want to be forty-five and still a freshman.
- I think we all want to find the love of our life and live our fantasies. What art student hasn't used his art to get girls? What journalists or actors haven't used their craft as well? It's a very human instinct to pursue.
- I'm pretty reclusive. I'm a homebody.
- I wanted to write in film or something like that. I thought acting was an embarrassing thing to say you wanted to do, especially when you're young. It seemed really uncool.
- We just have to accept who we are, and I'm a film nerd, for better or worse.
- The power of love is a strong thing.
- The media in the States can be quite self-reflective. When I lived in England, I was much more aware of the day-to-day politics that were happening. Living somewhere where the media involvement is greater and so omnipresent, you become pulled into it and, at the same time, because of that, politics changes and the way it's handled changes.
- The weird thing about acting is you're the most competent when you're at your best, but you have to be validated.
- I think I still want to be a music director as a grown man.
- I'm so disappointed in the frat parties at Columbia. I'm like an English boy going to an American college. I'm thinking cheerleaders, I'm thinking kegs. That's not what's on the cards.
- I always prefer shooting on locations, because when I'm at home, it's harder to sort of get lost in the world of whatever you're making. It does, it does force this bond and community amongst a group.
- I really love stories about women.
- I love 'Scarface.'
- I watch a lot DVDs. I don't leave my room too much.
- I'm an only child, and so I over-rely on my friends to lend their support.
- With a famous name, you have to work that much harder to get the part.
- I always prefer shooting on locations, because when I'm at home, it's harder to sort of get lost in the world of whatever you're making.
- I find women more interesting to watch on a lot of levels, and I like the idea of being involved with something I would watch.
- If you go to my Netflix, the sections that they recommend are 'Thrillers with a Strong Female Lead,' 'Comedies With a Strong Female Lead.'
- My dad had a company, and there were various films that hadn't gone into production that I'm trying to nurture.
- 'Teen Spirit' is a celebration of the power that music can deliver to the cinematic experience.
- I remember, when I started acting officially, I was unbelievably green. My first audition tapes were just horrendous.
- I never felt particularly alienated as an English person in America. It doesn't feel culturally like a massive gap to me.
- I always thought I'd make films. I didn't think I'd be in them.
- I love romantic comedies.
- I think it'd be pretty unrealistic to think we're the only planet in the world with thinking beings. It's kind of a strange conceit. Especially given how many universes there must be.
- I behave differently in different situations, and I'm slightly unstable and insecure, which I think are natural conditions of what I do. And I have a weird ear. Whatever I hear, I emulate. When I was a kid I did impressions: Forrest Gump, Rain Man, really big caricatures.
- I'm very schizophrenic and malleable as a human being.
- My father quite honestly played no role in my decision to become an actor.
- 'Mean Girls' is awesome.
- 26 is my favourite number.
- I love Michael Bay movies. I don't think I'd be selling out if I did one. I happen to like his movies. I think selling out is doing something you don't believe in, and you're doing it for a selfish purpose.
- I've always found that acting has been quite a hard thing to pre-manage because so much of it is spontaneous and the circumstances so uncontrolled.
- I was alone more than most kids.
- I'm on Twitter. I love Twitter because I'm kind of voyeuristic. I don't tweet, but I look at other people's.
- It's surreal working with people you admire. I don't think it ever goes away, no matter how human people are; there's always that moment of 'Oh wow, that's still George Clooney!' But I find that the most talented people tend to be the nicest.
- I have no agenda at all. I just want to do stuff I like. It can cost $200 million or $200 thousand.
- I'm obsessed with the power of music and image together. There's also something about music videos that are incredibly glamorous - there's a fetishistic aesthetic to them that you don't really see in movies in the same way.
