- I always have snack-y foods with me, like nuts and individually wrapped prunes. I don't like getting hungry. When you're hungry, you'll look for foods, and it's never salad; it's always muffins!

- When Elon was 17 and my daughter was 15, they really wanted to move to Canada, where my family is from. I said no, because I wanted to do a Ph.D. in Johannesburg, and I was getting lots of modeling work there. But Elon and I went over to visit, and while I was gone my daughter sold my home and my car and had a big garage sale with all my furniture.
- I'm not such a huge hater of anti-aging things because when I put makeup on, I look younger. You can brighten up your eyes and look more glamorous and more confident.

- Ralph Lauren is wonderful.
- I'm so flattered that at 69, people are booking me and finding me on Instagram.
- I'm not good at sports, but I do exercise because we have to move. Besides walking my dog four times a day, I go to the gym and do 30 minutes on a stationary bike while reading a book because I get bored, then 10 minutes of weights and 10 of stretches.

- My dog wakes me at 6:30 in the morning, so pretty much, I have to get up.
- I would model when they wanted me, and as I got older, they wanted an older model. I was quite willing to be mother of the bride at 28. I was quite happy to be on the cover of a grandparents' magazine at 42; I have no ego about that.
- I would say, anyone who knows me says they don't envy my life. I've just been through very hard times, yes.

- If you can eat five fruits and vegetables a day, that alone can totally change your diet.
- I don't take supplements - I get nutrition from food.
