- I caught the mentorship bug when I was Miss California U.S.A. and volunteered to mentor for a brand new program called 'Who's Your Hero.' I literally fell in love with the impact it all has, not only on the girls but on myself - giving back is such a powerful thing.
- I can watch 'Mission: Impossible' all day every day. Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt is so hot.
- Modeling is fun, but unless it's runway, it's just not my thing.
- As silly as it sounds, I want to do some sort of superhero type of role. That's always been something I'm interested in.
- Try your hardest to be confident in who you are. You are enough - you are beautiful.
- I would absolutely love to do something with Viola Davis or Meryl Streep. I just think both of those women fall so deep into their characters that you are no longer looking at the actresses, you are looking at the characters they embraced.
- If a guy is tall, that's a plus, and he has to have a great personality. He needs to keep up with me because I can be an off-the-wall, aloof chatterbox sometimes! But if he's got some height on him... God bless.
- I feel like I'd be a really good teacher. I would go for middle school... those high schoolers would be difficult to deal with.
- When I was a kid, I'd create my own movies at home. I'd record myself doing a scene, then stop the camera, change my clothes, and do a scene as another character. It sounds silly, but I just loved to tell stories.
- I was writing, directing, and editing my own films as a young kid with my parents' video camera.
- Yes, my pageant career was incredibly short. I started at 19 and was done at 21. I started by competing for Miss California Teen, which I wound up winning, and I literally just entered the contest on a whim!
