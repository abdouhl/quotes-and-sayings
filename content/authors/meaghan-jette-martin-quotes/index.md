- If you were there behind every family's closed doors, everyone's a little wacko. Chances are that your family is no weirder than the next family or than the other girl at school's family. Everyone can be quirky at times, and I embrace that, personally.
- I love to sing, but I really only love to do it when it goes along with acting, when it's my character singing. I'd rather not do an album or tour.
- I am good at baking. I don't know if that counts as a talent, but I love to bake. Everybody says I'm good at it, so apparently I make the best banana bread.
- I always loved to be a ham and be at the center of attention, always in everybody's faces.
- I think everyone to a certain degree wants to be accepted.
- I've always been steady on and off keeping diaries and journals. I try to document everything so I can remember it the older I get.
- I was very much not a follower of labels in school. If anything, I was labeled 'uncool.'
- I have competed with a friend over a guy, but I was always the one who would give in. It's not worth it to fight with a friend over a guy.
- Everybody has their first love. I think it goes back to being in love with the idea of being in love. Everybody wants love, and your first love is special. You've never experienced anything like that. It's good to have a fond memory of it.
- Young Hollywood can absolutely feel like high school sometimes, which is hard, but it's part of life. If you get enough humans involved, there is bound to be a little drama.
- In high school, I would classify myself as a theatre nerd. Always studying, reading and attending plays!
- I think the best way to deal with fitting in is to be yourself. It sounds hard, but in the end, it's much easier than pretending to be something you're not.
