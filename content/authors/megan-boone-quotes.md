- I'm allergic to attitude.
- I grew up in a retirement community in Florida.
- Adele's voice is incredible. Chet Baker also has one of my favorite voices of all time, and so does Joni Mitchell. And Frank Black. Oh, and Stevie Nicks.
- British actors wear wigs a lot. I find it to be a nice ritual at the end of the day, take the wig off, clean the makeup off, go home, leave work behind me.
- I've always been sort of drawn to storytelling, and I was always very playful growing up.
