- If you find a story that everybody likes and everybody relates to in some way, then you know you have a good story. But if you're telling a story and all the women are going, 'I'm checked out of this, I just don't really care,' then you're going to have some problems.
- I grew up watching 'I Love Lucy.'
- When I was in college I wrote for a newspaper there called the 'Every Three Weekly,' which, like a lot of college humor papers, was sort of based on 'The Onion.'
- And what's nice about 'Sunny' is that it has this honesty with the viewers, which is, like, they're here because they're on a television show and they're locked in this purgatory where they have to keep doing the same things with each other.
- I don't think any of my classmates would say I was a class clown.
- You want to represent it accurately, and the accurate representation of quarantine is not that it's sad all the time or that people are struggling constantly, it's that there are these moments of hardship and then there are intense moments of levity and kinship and people supporting each other.
- Humanity as a concept is neither comic nor tragic.
- Women are not diversity. We're half the population.
- Any time you give the average person the opportunity to explain themselves on a national scale, they're always going to sound like a fool.
- We need to make sure we're bringing in diverse voices and not expecting everyone to be a representation of their ethnicity or their age or their gender, but judge them individually and make sure that we're figuring out who the person is and not just checking a box.
- You're trying to write for your idols. It's strange.
- What I always liked about 'Sunny' whenever it approached any sort of hot-button issue is that, ultimately, what the characters felt about it could change at any given instant depending on what benefited them the most personally.
- I was groped by a producer at a party a couple years ago, after which I made an anonymous complaint to HR. As far as I know he was never personally disciplined.
- It's dangerous to think of yourself as a hero and someone else as a villain. It gets in the way of empathy.
- Women are not different creatures from men. They don't need to be extra careful around us. They just need to treat us with the same basic respect and dignity that they show to other men.
- People should see the good that can happen when you aren't afraid to accept responsibility for your mistakes.
- When women are seen on TV being crass or funny or making jokes or undercutting someone, then you feel it's socially acceptable for a woman to do that. More women are growing up feeling, 'I can speak my mind and say what I want.'
- They didn't let us see daylight on 'Community.'
- Once I started writing at 'The Onion' I was like, oh this is it, this is my dream job, I've achieved my dream job.
- 'Community' definitely always had a feel of being like college, where it's like, 'Let's band together and stay up all night to do this crazy thing!'
- There have always been funny women. But in some ways, it takes a while for there to be women who were watching women on television for years and then grow up and think, 'I could do funny stuff.'
- I realized there wasn't a structure in place at the time to have female mentors in positions above you. If there were women above me, they had gone through such a difficult time to get there that they had internalized the idea that women share the same space in the writers' room.
- We're sort of in an age now when we have too much information, which can take us down a specific path. You're getting too much information too quickly to be able to slow it down and parse it out.
- Anytime people engage in something creative or just something they are really passionate about, obviously, it's hard to separate your personal feelings from what it is you are making.
- In 'Red Dead Redemption' they have a thing where if you walk through snow your footsteps stay where you've gone. I think that's just representative of humanity.
- On 'Modern Family,' we have outlines, really strong outlines, when we go off to draft, so you have a reasonable expectation that that will be the story of your episode.
- 'Ocarina of Time.' That was my favorite. I loved N64.
- For comedy reasons, any place we can have really big egos and very high stakes is a great thing to go for.
- I would love to approach, like, what are the lives of the people that actually play 'Mythic Quest,' because you have these devs that are affecting their lives.
- I'm getting to know the 'Modern Family' cast, and they are very sweet. They are very nice and supportive and game for things.
- Just keep making comedy. Make it all the time whether it's your job or not. Consider it like you are already working or in the middle of your career.
- I haven't worked on a lot of different shows, but from just watching different shows I've noticed that there isn't necessarily on every show that love of crafting an episode that has the three part act structure that comes around and actually tells a complete story.
- 'Community' was my world for four seasons and my job for three, and has hold of my whole heart like a bad-news high school boyfriend.
- Yeah, I started with 'The Onion,' that was my first job out of college.
- There are headlines that I remember pitching that I think I know that they're not any good. But some part of my heart is attached to them. Like I had this one that was 'Spork Used as Knife.'
- Growing up I was very feminist. I had strong opinions, but I would go about my beliefs in the wrong ways.
- Just because you're a woman in gaming doesn't mean you're a nice person all the time necessarily.
- I started reading 'The Onion' when I was 13 years old.
