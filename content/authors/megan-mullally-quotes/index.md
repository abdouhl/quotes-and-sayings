- There's kind of a double standard: if a musician decides they want to act, everybody falls over themselves. But if you're an actor and you have a band, everyone's, 'Ugh, disgusting! It's a vanity project.'
- Speaking theoretically, in a completely made-up world where 'Will & Grace' is coming back to NBC for 10 episodes - just in that made-up world - it couldn't be a better time. I think more so now than even when we started! And who would have ever - I mean, it's heinous that it's because Donald Trump is the president-elect.
- Nick hasn't seen me naked - I'm not a person who's constantly flinging my clothes aside and strutting about.
- Isn't that sort of what happened with gay marriage? Right before gay marriage was legalized, everybody was just losing their minds and, like, the worst possible things were happening, and it was just all like it couldn't get any worse, and then it suddenly got a lot better.
- I typed up a long email with different band name ideas and sent it to Stephanie, and they all started with 'the'.
- I'm a big hit with guards at security. They're the center of my fan base, the airport security guards.
- I get offered stuff that I don't really want to do, so hopefully, I'm just kind of waiting for the right thing.
- I don't know other couples that work together a fraction as much as Nick and I do. We met in a play, and we've done TV and movies, and we just did 'Annapurna,' our off-Broadway show, and we've done theater together several times, so it's just a little bit of everything.
- A lot of people are saying it's an inspiration to see a couple who are in love and getting a kick out of each other.
- Actors talking about themselves. Nothing better!
- I tend to let the chips fall where they may. I don't know if that's right or wrong.
- I always thought, 'Oh, Cher seems so cool. If I ever met her, I know we'd be best friends.'
- I think a lot of actors, maybe who have been on a hit show and been lucky enough to get successful, might say 'no' more than I do. And maybe that's good, maybe that's smart. I don't know.
- Nick gets carsick if he's not driving - plus, he's basically a walking atlas. He can drive around any city without a map, which works out fine for me because I just become our entertainment director and pick out which audio book we'll listen to next.
- People who have theater or sketch-comedy backgrounds seem to be more, you know, our speed. Like Amy Poehler and Will Arnett - we double date.
- I had been watching the Emmys since I was probably 5 years old. Those shows, when you're a kid, it all seems like such a big, big deal, and only special certain people would win one of these big things like a Tony or an Emmy or an Oscar.
- Why can't I ever play a nice, normal, salt-of-the-earth type? Is there something I should know? It's fun to play villains and character roles, of course - but I'm sure it's also fun to be a really big star and play the lead in everything, where all you have to do is show up and not blink.
- Selling a band predicated on nothing is always an interesting proposition, and of course, the fact of the matter is that I really started out in music before I ever acted, and I've done a ton of singing.
- At first, people were like, 'I've discovered something - you guys are married!' I was like, 'Yeah, that's not a secret. We've been married now already for many years.'
- Madonna was very cool. I thought she was really nice, really present, and she worked really, really hard... She didn't necessarily know our real names in real-life, because why should she? Who cares? Some of the cast were really offended, like, 'She doesn't even know my name!' I'm like, 'Who cares? Madonna's doing our show. It doesn't matter.'
- We had a gay marriage on 'Will & Grace' in 2000, 2001. And I was like, 'Gay marriage?' I mean, it was just really early.
- People find it confusing I'm in a band, even though music was my main thing before acting.
- Theater is great because you're able to tell a narrative arc without a break. I think it's more about the material and whether what we get offered is good.
- He proposed, in London, in 2002.
- Karen was always such a lawless rebel: carrying a gun in her purse, flirting with 14-year-old boys. She's the worst. You know that horrible guy Milo Yiannopoulos? She has about as many redeeming qualities as he has.
- We're both big Glen Campbell fans - it's one of the things that united us in eternal love.
- In terms of the first Christmas when I met everybody, I went over to Nick's grandfather's house where they were having the big Christmas dinner, and they have this tradition of this thing called oyster stew.
- I secretly had this name 'Nancy and Beth' come into my mind, and I thought, 'Oh my God, that's such a funny, interesting, weird name for a band.'
- My mom is elderly, and she's not doing too well, and I've literally never told her about 'Childrens Hospital,' because I fear that if she ever sees it, it will be like the coup de grace.
- John Cleese was my personal favorite because he played my husband for a whole season - and Minnie Driver. We almost had our own, like, show all living in a house together. And Gene Wilder was just so dear.
- There were some articles written about our marriage, mythologising it, making it into the greatest love story ever told.
- All I know is Karen is besties with Donny and Melania.
- I used to watch 'ER' a little bit when it was at its kind of apex.
- You should definitely stay true to your own style.
- I feel like Nick and I have the best relationship and the best marriage.
- I had a lot of friends for a long time who were gay, and I didn't even realize it for awhile. Even in my mid- to late 20s, I was still pretty naive about it.
- I never had a burning desire to have children. But then I met Nick, and I thought, 'This is the only person I'd do this with.' So we tried, but I was a little long in the tooth for that sort of thing. But we didn't turn it into a soap opera. We tried for about a year or so, and it didn't happen and took that to mean it wasn't meant to be.
- I've always been a late bloomer, so I never feel like, 'Oh, I'm gettin' older; I guess everything is gonna stop.' I'm the opposite: 'Oh, I'm just getting started.'
- I love creating new characters that are whatever they are.
- Now, it's weird not to have gay characters on a show.
- Multi-camera's fun because you have the immediacy of the audience and just being able to tell the story more or less straight through. The thing I like about single-camera is that you have the luxury of shooting a lot of different options.
- I always hear some couples can't work together, and I don't get that. We have the most fun when we're working together.
- I can understand everybody associates me with Karen, but beyond that, I think after time passes and a few years go by, that sort of becomes a non-issue. That character is far - I mean really, all the characters I've played are pretty far away from what I'm really like.
- One year at the SAG Awards, somebody practically knocked me over, and it was Helen Mirren. She was like, 'Oh my God - is it really you? I'm your biggest fan.' I was like, 'Wait, aren't you supposed to be home reading Shakespeare or something?'
- If we're ever seen having a public spat in a coffee shop, I think the concept of romance will die.
- I lived in Chicago in the early '80s and did a ton of theater, and then Nick lived there in the '90s and did a ton of theater. Then we both moved to L.A. and did a ton of television.
- We do jigsaw puzzles. Here's a pro tip: Listen to an audiobook while doing it.
- Sean is so funny. One time he went to Ireland for two weeks with his mother, and Ireland is so beautiful, and he got back; we were like, 'How was it?' and he was like, 'Ugh I was so bored.'
- All the writers on our show went in and got in the bed and took a picture in Cher's bed, even though she was never in it.
- You can't really be super conservative and continue to keep your audience, but at least the audience that we attract comes with a certain level of naughtiness.
- We already do a couple numbers with chairs - chairs being a classic, Bob Fosse-ish, showbizzy prop, but the punk element is that it's just me and Stephanie and this funky band from Austin.
- That's all you ever want - to do your job well enough that people on the other end are happy.
- Nobody's ever kept their sitcom character going after the show's off the air.
- I get deep into the creative aspect, and Nick is the people person.
- I like to work. I mean, part of it for me is that I was a struggling actor, could barely pay my rent, until I was almost 40.
- We met in April of 2000, and we weren't really an official couple until June or July. His family has a fishing trip they go on every year in Minnesota, so he had invited me to go and meet his whole family. There was, like, no cell phone service at the time; people were using those giant cordless phones that looked like a brick.
- I'd just like to retire quietly with dignity, secure in the knowledge that no more comedies will ever be made now that I'm gone.
- I started 'Will & Grace' when I was 39, and Nick started 'Parks and Rec' when he was 39. And he's really on the same trajectory; it's all happening with the same timing. It's so funny to see it all happening again.
- I'll quit coffee. It won't be easy drinking my Bailey's straight, but I'll get used to it. It'll still be the best part of waking up.
- I'm from Oklahoma, and Nick's from a small town in Illinois.
- You can really shoot things you think might work on camera one way, then you can try it that way, and then if you think it could also work another way, you have that luxury of shooting a bunch of different steps, and then they can decide in editing what works the best.
- Karen will never die. Max Mutchnick, one of the creators of the show, has always maintained that Karen is a bat who balls up and hangs from a rafter and sleeps during the day and that she'll live forever.
- People are always flabbergasted, like, 'You sing?'
- Nobody knew if the pilot would even get picked up because it had two gay lead characters, which has never happened before. And now every show has at least two gay characters, if not many more.
- I love Chicago - absolutely love Chicago. I mean, I'd much rather go to Chicago and do a play or a musical than New York, honestly. Because just probably for reasons that are obvious to you. It's just a little bit - it's a nicer, easier city.
- During 'Will & Grace,' we had so many things we had to go to where you get all dolled up. It's like pulling teeth for me.
- Playing Karen was so satisfying that it almost cured my acting bug completely. Not that I had conquered the world of acting. It was just that I had something to prove to myself when I started Will & Grace. Now I feel like, okay, well, I've satisfied that.
- Nobody knows I sing. Even though I've done Broadway musicals. I would only pick it over acting because it's such a pure form of emotional expression.
- I kind of connected the dots, like, 'Oh, we're just saying stuff. We're just saying things that make sense, so let's just say them like you say them in real life.' It was my first and one of my only acting lessons 'cause I never really studied acting.
- There's sacrificing for your art, and then there's just being dumb.
- It's funny when you follow your own sort of bliss, then other people tend to respond in kind, meaning audiences. It's really weird how that works, but it does seem to apply to 'Nancy & Beth' especially.
- I've done three Broadway musicals and tons of concerts and all kinds of things, but nobody knows that except the people in New York.
- He is not like Ron Swanson at all because he's very emotional and vulnerable. He is all of the things that I guess Ron was really deep down. He's not a Libertarian, but he does like bacon and meat.
- Nick is 11 and a half years younger than I am, so his mom is only, like, 11 or 12 years older than me. I didn't call her Mrs. Offerman because that would be weird because we're, like, the same age, so I think I went straight to Cathy, but there's a mom element, and his parents are so great.
- I married the reigning mustache champion.
- Nick has said he would divorce me if I got Botox.
- Nick's just from this very Norman Rockwell-ish family. They're very 'American Gothic,' and his parents are so kind, and they're not brash people; they're very soft spoken, salt of the earth.
- People get up and say, 'I didn't prepare a speech because I didn't think I would win.' Well, that's dumb.
- Woody Harrelson played a long-term love interest of Debra Messing's; I think it was for a whole season. They almost cast Nick in that part. They almost had given to him. But at the eleventh hour, Jim Burrows put in a call to Woody, and he said he would do it.
- A lot of young people think it all comes to a screeching halt once you're 32. But it really doesn't.
- Nick was cast first in both 'Smashed' and 'Kings.'
- I think theater is more about living and breathing, versus TV, which can vary.
- I think of myself as a character actress, and Karen's just one of the characters I've gotten to play, but I feel like Karen takes on so much more weight because the show was on for eight seasons, and it was such a popular show. But you have to move on to telling another story in a different world.
- I certainly have gay friends, but I don't remember thinking, 'Oh my God, I have this friend, and they're gay, and that's so cool.' I mean, I was very naive until I got to a certain age.
- My favorite thing to do is just stay home with the dogs and read or watch movies and be together.
- Karen is like RuPaul - she's a character. It never occurred to me until now, but she is!
- In real life, there's nobody more out than Sean. It was just in the press that he didn't want to say one way or another. I think he just felt it was nobody's business, but I feel like he came to it in his own time.
- Nick can get up on stage and just wing it, whereas I would have to be taken to a mental institution.
- My mom was extremely supportive of me, but it could err on the side of... I mean, there's supportive, and then there's just full-on over-hovering.
- We have a two-week rule. We're never apart for more two weeks. Just not being separated for Jurassic periods of time seems to help. And no children probably helps a lot.
- The ratio of celebrity divorces is probably about the same as non-celebrity divorces; it's just that the non-celebrity divorces don't get a lot of public scrutiny, normally.
