- I'm an instinctual actor. I don't really talk about it. Usually if I get a script and I'm having trouble with it, I go to sleep and I dream about it because I'm super internal with the way I work.
- Our society is so obsessed with working out to be skinny, and none of that has a purpose. I love that my daughter sees me running because she knows I have a race and that I want to be faster. It becomes much less of a grind when it's that way.
- A lot of people assume that once you're working in Hollywood you become some sort of glamour-diva, which could not be further from the truth about me.
- When you're a comedic actor and you're used to just getting laughs, it's kind of scary to go serious, even for a second.
- I'm not an exhibitionist in any way, shape or form. I don't even like having my picture taken!
- I want to write, act, and direct!
- Everyone wants to turn on their TV and have a break from their normal day.
- I started out doing triathlons because they terrified me! I'm a good swimmer, I learned to ride a bike in college, and I hate running. It seemed like something I could never do, so I decided, 'I'm gonna do it.'
- I've been on one TV series after another. None of the network decisions have ever made sense to me.
- I can't put this delicately - everyone goes to their high school reunion wanting to see who they 'beat.'
- Eat food. Eat actual food. I try to not eat anything processed or sugar-free - I eat lots of fruits and vegetables.
- Sitcoms are designed for normal people who just want to turn on their TV and get a laugh. It's not high-brow, you don't have to work so hard, and it's meant to be a relatable genre. That's why I love it so much - my fans are from 8 years old to 80 years old, because everybody can relate to what's funny.
- Finding a way to find humor in things that are hardcore is definitely something that, I think, the sitcom does best.
- Writing is the greatest thing about really good sitcoms.
