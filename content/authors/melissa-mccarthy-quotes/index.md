- I would love to be directed by more women.
- We have some of the most rock-solid, lovely friends in the world.
- When I read a character that I really, really love, I know immediately what they look like. It's like I want to 100 percent become that person.
- I have blocks of wood all over my house; I spend all of my day knocking!
- I am not a princess, I don't want to be referred to as a princess - I find that super creepy.

- I love to watch someone who just goes for it and isn't worried about whether it's silly or awkward or unflattering.

- To me, having 500 rolls of fabric around is the most calming thing in the world. I think it's what football is to some guys.
- The goal was to work enough to pay my bills and stop going through the couch looking for change. Going way beyond that isn't something I really factored in.
- I loved the playfulness of fashion. I think maybe that's why I became an actress. You put on one outfit and feel one way, and another one will make you feel another way. Clothes are a wonderful tool.
- I will embarrass my kids to their core. I will threaten to show up in hot pants and a tube top. Their dad will drive me. And he'll let me and my friend Lisa get pretty drunk in the backseat, and we will come into that party and just rip it up.
- Comedy to me is all about the bumps and bruises and weird tics.

- Sometimes I wish I were just magically a size 6 and I never had to give it a single thought.
- We're a weird bunch at 'Mike & Molly.' We go to work, and we're crazy about each other, and we love where we go to work.

- I just figure if it has my name on it, and I want to make people feel good about wearing it, I can't pass it off.

- Strangers shouldn't be allowed to take a picture of your child and sell it for profit.
- I think there are people who really love the comfort of their small town, and there are people who feel stuck by it.
- I did nothing but dramas for seven years in New York. I didn't really start anything comedic until I moved out to L.A. and found The Groundlings.
- More eccentric characters can push pretty far, but if you stay on the side of reality, it's always funnier.
- When I went to college, I did clothing and textiles. It really wasn't until I moved to New York, my second night in, I did stand-up. I took a wild left turn, and instead of going back and finishing school at FIT, I started doing stand-up and acting.
- I think the whole reason I act is because it's much more fun to be somebody else. I'm pretty boring.
- When I was 22, I met with some janky manager, and she told me, 'You're never going to work at this weight.' I think I was a size 6 at the time. There is just this weird thing about how we perceive women in this country. I would love to be a part of breaking that down.
- I've never felt like I needed to change. I've always thought, 'If you want somebody different, pick somebody else.' But sure, criticism can sometimes still get to me. Some things are so malicious, they knock the wind out of you.

- You look much better when you're comfy.
- I'm obsessed with 'Call The Midwife.'
- I love a woman who's solid in her shoes.
- The letters I really love are from young actresses who were worried they had to fit a certain look. They say I've opened it up. And I don't just mean plus-size girls. You can push things now. With all the great performances in 'Bridesmaids', it changed how people see funny women.
- I laugh my head off every day with my husband and my kids, who are mooning me and singing me songs.
- I've grown to love L.A., but it's the most socially awkward place. All these people have come there not to be something but to pretend to be someone trying to be someone.
- Jason Statham is funny, I never knew that.
- It's funny; as I get older I'm reverting to my roots - I want to plant stuff.
- I feel intensely guilty for working... You have to be able to provide for your kids. But I feel like it's a weird modern phenomenon that you always feel guilty for it.
- I love a house project.
- I do think comedy needs to be a living thing, but I think without a great script and fully realized characters, you cannot keep it living. Otherwise, it just becomes long and rambling, indulgent. So I think you need both, frankly.
- I didn't really know how to write jokes, so I just told weird, long stories about being tall and beautiful and wealthy in New York. I'd tell them very seriously, but I kind of looked like a drag queen at the time with big wigs and crazy 12-inch platform heels.
- I'm always tinkering with something - suddenly I'll think I can work with wood, but then I'll realize I can't, so I go back to sewing.
- In a lot of comedies, they kind of take all the problems away from the women. They give her great clothes, great hair; she almost always owns an artisanal shop, like a cheese shop in Manhattan.
- I believe in Heaven. I don't believe that this is it, and then we're done.
- I'm not a crazy germophobe; I have kids, and that ship has sailed.
- When someone really believes in what they're saying, but it's crazy, it's, like, my favorite thing on earth.

- The average size of a woman is 14.
- I want to make each piece of clothing work 15 different ways.
- At some point in the past, it was decided that women in comedy are never supposed to be shown in an unflattering light. But in comedy, you need all of your tools to be funny.
- I don't really know why I'm not thinner than I am.
- I love the juxtaposition of a sweet little blouse with a motocross look.
- I was always Missy, never Melissa. I went to college, and I thought it was so much more interesting to go by a different name, and then it just kind of stuck.
- I refuse to give energy to the negative. I've got a great fella and two great little girls.
- I went to school for clothing and textiles and thought this is what I was going to do. Then I started working in costumes and literally said, 'I don't know if I can take the actors.'
- I think there's so many points of view that you want to make sure your stories are being told from men and women... you get all of the different backgrounds. You don't want every story being told from the same point of view. So just for better storytelling, I'm like, 'Yes, please, bring some more ladies on.'
- I believe it matters how you treat people. I believe in Heaven. I don't believe that this is it, and then we're done. I have a lovely relationship with God, although when I've lost someone or I've seen a sick child, I've had conversations with Him in which I've had to ask, 'How can that be right?'
- One of the best parts of a woman's body is that curve, and I go a little bit higher on all of my things to show off the best part of the hourglass.
- I've never been interested in playing the boring ingenue.
- I'm very boring. But I'm a bit obsessed with women that are so incredibly solid in their shoes that they don't care what other people think of them. I just think there's something so interesting about that kind of confidence.
- In my 20s, I used to cry about why I wasn't thinner or prettier, but I want to add that I also used to cry about things like, 'I wish my hair would grow faster. I wish I had different shoes...' I was an idiot... It's a decade of tears.
- I've been every size in the world. Parts of my twenties, I was in great shape, but I didn't appreciate it. 'If I was a 6 or an 8,' I thought, 'Why aren't I a 2 or a 4?'
- I could eat healthier; I could drink less.
- I was only a bridesmaid for my sister, and it was very calm and small, so I didn't have any tragedy.
- I'll do almost anything for a laugh.
- I see teenagers or people who are 21 and think, 'I was an idiot at that age.' I was running around New York like a crazy woman. Thank God I only had three and a half cents to my name. I was too immature to handle success then.
- I was never sullen. I was a terrible punk - I was still so chatty.

- I just don't lose weight easily.

- Ben and I have absolutely nothing to do with the Hollywood that's all actors and the Sunset Strip. We crave talking to people who do different things and are passionate about it.

- Nothing's more charming than someone who doesn't take herself too seriously.
- I'm not a great pregnant woman.
- I've never been interested in playing the boring ingenue. I always wonder: Who's her weird friend? I like the oddballs.
- I'm a huge 'Ghostbusters' fan. I've seen it, like, 10,000 times, so I couldn't be more looking forward to a reboot.
- Somebody ripped their pants open at my wedding, dipping my mother. My mother is not a lady who throws herself into a dip that often, so I don't think he thought she was really going to do it.
- I've been trying to play old-lady parts since I was in my 20s, so I look forward to all of that.
- Funny is funny, and it can come in 8 billion different shades and flavors, so I think it's silly to kind of limit it.
- Since grade school, I focused on women's clothing.
- In terms of the characters I think are really fun to play, a lot of times it's someone in my head saying 'I know that woman.'

- Part of being young is you think gaining 6 lbs. is the end of the world.
- I just think we tear down women in this country for all these superficial reasons, and women are so great and strong.
- Ben and I live like hermits. The night of a concert, we'll be like, 'Do you think we can get tickets?' And everybody is like, 'No, why didn't you do this earlier?'
- When I believe in something, I'm like a dog with a bone.
- Even when someone gets to looking like she should be so proud of herself, instead she's like, 'I could be another three pounds less; I could be a little taller and have bigger lips.'
- As a teenager I went all Goth, but I wasn't mopey enough. I would pretend to be, but I'd end up making people laugh.
- I'd rather watch a character be good at something and be challenged - there's more to play in that.
- I wore white kabuki makeup, had blue-black hair. At one point, I shaved an inch and a half around my hairline and continued the white makeup up so it made my head look slightly deformed. I thought it was hilarious.
- I didn't wear jeans for, like, a decade of my life.
