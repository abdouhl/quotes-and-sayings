- Unfortunately, I don't think I can call myself an activist because I don't really do enough of anything.

- I wrote a lot when I was younger, though never anything like plays or scripts.
- I grew up in New York, and I grew up with a mother who was an arts lover herself, and I went to these New York City public schools with these great arts education programs, so it was something that I was lucky enough to be able to be exposed to very early.
- I do think there are trends in your life once you've been auditioning long enough. I was the angry teenager and then the sweet victim.

- It's always nice to be able to play different things.
- You want to work on something that people watch and that people like.
- I used to joke that if acting didn't work out, poetry was my commonsense fallback.
- It's always nice to be thought of and asked to do anything, let alone something different.
