- I am a much happier 27-year-old than I was at 20 years old. I am so fortunate because I have an amazing family, amazing friends and a great support system.
- My mom is my role model. Charlie and I have two great sets of parents, but our moms are often the ones that go with us to competitions. My mom was with me in Sochi. I am so lucky to be a part of the Thank You Mom program partnered with Puffs and P&G.
- I keep my phone on the floor in my bedroom, and I turn the sound off when I sleep, but I never really turn my phone off.
- If someone were to actually come to one of our training sessions, there's lots of flipping and sweating and crying and blood going on all over the place. I mean, if that doesn't qualify it as a sport, then I don't know what does.
- Part of the strength that Charlie and I have as a team is we've been able to keep our priorities straight through our entire partnership. We've been able to maintain a life outside of skating, and though we've given up a lot of things and we've been training really hard our entire lives, we've been able to maintain great social lives.
- I went to Niagara Falls with my family when I was young, and I cried because I thought it would be bigger.
- I don't think that we have a consistent team motto, but before we take to the ice, Charlie and I like to go over things and just reminding ourselves to have a wonderful time and enjoy the moment.
- Just remember: to be grateful and thank the people who are there and support you along the way is a great start to success.
- I think success is finding happiness! Everyone certainly has different goals in life, and things that are important to them, and also things that are not important to them.
- I'm used to being coached. Something I learned long ago is that a coach is trying to make you better and to be the best version of yourself.
- I'm in Delta Delta Delta, otherwise known as Tri-Delta. I've developed some great friendships, and it's enabled me to have a little bit more of a normal college experience.
- One piece of advice that I would give to any young athlete or performer is remember to thank your mom.
- Oftentimes we will get to the rink when the sun comes up and leave when the sun is setting, so on a weekend, I really like to spend at least one day outside and not be stuck indoors all day.
- Charlie and I discovered at a really young at that we had a passion for figure skating, and I think that passion drives us to work every day to improve and grow. We have really learned to love our sport more and more, year to year. And the hard work really pays off.
