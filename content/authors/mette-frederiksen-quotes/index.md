- I pay my tax in the belief that you pay yours. I pay for your doctor's visit, in the belief that you pay for mine. In Denmark we don't have gold mines, but we have something more important. We have trust in one another.
- We must strengthen everything that defines Denmark. I look forward to working with all of you here in Parliament. We must live up to the hopes we have generated: a safer, more just and greener Denmark.
- Normally, I would seek to compromise, but not on immigration policy.
- Economic policy and foreign policy in Europe have been too liberal. We have failed when it comes to maintaining the social contract, which is the very foundation of the social-democratic social model.
- I know that many Danes are worried about the future. Worried about jobs, about open borders. About whether we can find a balance in immigration policy.
- I always make lists of things I need to get done. I like the sense of having completed one thing so I can move on to the next.
- When you come to Denmark, you have the chance to live in a free, peaceful country with access to free education, free medical aid and the opportunity to work. To benefit from that requires responsibility. If you don't assume that responsibility, it is a breach in trust.
- Greenland is not for sale.
- For me, it is becoming increasingly clear that the price of unregulated globalisation, mass immigration and the free movement of labour is paid for by the lower classes.
- For years, we have underestimated the challenges of mass immigration.
- Thankfully, the time where you buy and sell other countries and populations is over.
- When you are close allies and good friends, like Denmark and the U.S. are, there should also be room for disagreements along the way.
