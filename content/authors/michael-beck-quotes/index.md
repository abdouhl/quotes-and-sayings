- Writing is much more satisfying on a certain level than acting ever was. Because you're not interpreting someone else's original idea, you can come up with your own.
- Driving a tractor never appealed to me. But I never wanted to go into business. Had I not accidentally fallen into acting, I would probably have gone home from college and farmed.
- Being an actor all of my life is kind of a collaborative, social form of interpretive art. Sitting down with a blank page every day by yourself is a different feeling.
- To be involved with movies that become kind of cult classics... I've been very fortunate. 'The Warriors' is certainly a cult classic, and 'Xanadu' is, to a certain degree, a cult classic as well.
- Doing audiobooks is kind of an actor's dream because you get to play all the parts.
- I had not grown up on theater - in Hughes, Ark., you went to see a movie on Saturday. So my acting heroes were movie stars. It was a natural thing for me to want to get into the movies.
- Though I'm considered a leading man, I still consider myself a character actor. Because acting, to me, is creating a character, not playing the same thing all the time.
- My brother was four years older and always building tree houses. Whether I wanted to or not, I learned carpentry.
- I often wonder why people remake movies. Is there just a lack of imagination out there that they can't come up with an original idea?
