- I broke my nose and got a concussion when I was 13.
- When I was 16, I was working on 'Arrested Development.' My memories of being 16 were just trying to keep up with school while doing the show and trying to be around all those people on the show, as much as I could.
- Acting is such a weird job.
- Since I was 15 I've felt kinda like... an old man.
- I may not have gone to high school every day, but I spent whole a lot of my adolescence feeling vulnerable and confused and alone... just like everybody else.
