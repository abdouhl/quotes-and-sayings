- The average married man lives two thousand and five days longer than his single counterpart, albeit with less reason.
- I've always admired the kind of guy who moves into a place and restores it. Thanks to my efforts, the guy who moves into mine will have a chance to do just that.
- I tell people my only successful long-term relationship was with Jim Packard. He was my rock. I didn't realize how codependent I was.
- I can only approach things indirectly, or I can't approach them at all.

- It's not just dead men who tell no tales. Live ones don't have much to say for themselves, either.
- I don't think anybody should do what they do in hopes of being successful. But I always expect myself to be successful at things. And if I'm not, I feel bad. I don't care for failure. I've failed at a number of things, and it's not my favorite state of mind. So I prefer success.
- I was the class innuendist.
- I really like Wisconsin. I enjoy it. I enjoy the people. I enjoy the fact that it's not L.A. or New York. And there's some sense of normalcy here - people having children in homes they can somewhat afford to live in.
- The goal for me has always been to learn how to express myself in radio and to have fun doing it and work with whatever contingencies arise.
- When I was a kid, I hated being talked to as a kid. I don't know if all kids feel that way, but I seem to remember awful things in the crib, something like people doing baby talk in the crib and sticking their big, fat faces in there and scaring me. So I always talk to kids as if they were a person.
- I was always a fan of Groucho Marx as a kid.
