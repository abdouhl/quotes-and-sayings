- I've always enjoyed the enthusiasm of the best studio musicians and, over the years, have collected so many inspired contributions from them.
- I started touring a little bit in 1973 in support of a record I made for an independent label. In 1975, when I signed with Warner Bros., where I remained happily ensconced for the next 24 years, my touring activity increased considerably.
- I write autobiographically, although I apply liberal amounts of poetic license.
- People often ask me how I developed my vocal sound, and the answer usually disappoints them: 'It's just the way I sound when I sing.'
