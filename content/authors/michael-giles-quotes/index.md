- I still don't know anything about drugs, or who takes them, or what happens.

- I think we were just coming out and being ourselves, instead of operating within boundaries that other people had created. We decided to do away with those boundaries.

- I think that what I'm interested with is the creative side of music-making, rather than all the travelling.
- I'm amazed at how adventurous and how dangerous the music was, and still is. I haven't heard anything like it since. I'm quite surprised, because a lot of the music on there we never heard at the time.
