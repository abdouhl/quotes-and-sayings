- It's quite hard not to cringe at your own music; you're always a bit annoyed at some parts of it.
- You always have in the back of your mind that would be cool if you get recognized. But you can't concentrate on any of those things. You've got to just keep playing and doing your music and the rest is just a bonus.
- I'm not really into the rock n' roll lifestyle; I'm a music geek!
