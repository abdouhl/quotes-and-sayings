- Clothes are like a good meal, a good movie, great pieces of music.

- Americans are always a little bit insecure.
- For me, true luxury can be caviar or a day with no meetings, no appointments and no schedule.
- North Americans as a whole need to embrace having clothes altered to their body. I hear it all the time: why do the Europeans always look so good? They have a relationship with their tailor and spend the time and money to make their clothes look their best.

- There are two kinds of designers: ones who are very happy locked in their office surrounded by their coterie. The last thing they need to do is to go to a trunk show; they'd go running for the hills. I not only enjoy it, I think, how do you design things that are applicable to life - unless you live it?
- People always think that designers hate each other. And we're certainly a competitive lot, but we also enjoy each other's company.
- When you try on something, you have to ask yourself, 'How many ways could I wear this? Could I wear it to work? To dinner or drinks? Will it span the seasons' If you have to think too hard about those questions, then skip it.

- People want to look taller and thinner. No one says, 'Ooh! Let me buy that dress because it makes me feel matronly!'
- In the '80s, it got to the point where we'd have shows with a hundred looks. You'd want to order a pizza before it was over!
- Because of what's going on with the economy, I think women are realizing that maybe they don't need a closet full of clothes. They just need the right clothes.
- I know what women look good in. I don't think the rules ever change.
- When I was a kid, I was trendier. I'd wear anything. I was in love beads and platforms.
