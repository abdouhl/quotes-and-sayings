- In too many cases, the moms, the dads, the sisters and brothers of children with cancer must stand by a hospital bed and watch helplessly as this horrible disease consumes the life of an innocent child.
- That's what really concerns me about the modern-day terrorists that we face is this global expansion.
- There's a conspiracy going on online every day between these top U.K. individuals within ISIS leadership out of Syria.
