- I had some terrible times - comparatively speaking. I saddled myself with a load of debt, I wasn't liked by a lot of my fellow comics and I used to blame other people for me not getting a break. But now I realise I just wasn't very good. And as soon as I became good, things took off pretty quickly.
- I suppose I'm always a little bit on edge.
- I've been performing stand-up comedy for ten years, it's what I love and will always do.
- I always knew I was quite good at getting laughs. At school, I loved having a ready audience if I made a cheeky remark.
- The people who don't like me are completely irrelevant to me, just as I'm irrelevant to them.
- It's a weird one: nobody notices when a brilliant comedian is fat or has sweat marks under their arms. Peter Kay isn't in the best shape and neither is Ricky Gervais, and it doesn't matter. Still, I like to feel like I'm transforming into something quite cool when I go on stage.
- I wanted to bat for the England cricket team. I was quite good at cricket. But then I kept getting out for low scores. It turned out I didn't have the talent.
- I was trying to do one-liners and it took me years to realise I just had to be myself. My fear was if I was myself and no one found it funny, I'd have nowhere left to go.
- Before I went into comedy I was a loner, very much wrapped up in my own thoughts. But I always liked myself and the way I thought.
- Given this voice, I know it does sound like I've come from money. But my dad was Canadian and my mum Hungarian, so it's not like I have some high-society, upper-class English background.
- I want to look svelte.
- I've always just tried to make the audience laugh.
- I think actually performing on stage when everyone's facing you and you're one person facing them, that is quite a lonely thing in a strange way. You have to be quite insular from everybody else, you've got thousands of people staring at you and you're just on your own.
- Coming up with your own opinion is hard. When I go to see a movie I don't really know if I enjoyed it, so I ask my wife and listen to people talking on the way out. If they all say it was magnificent I'll agree!
- I don't want a chat show or to be on telly every day, as that's not my business; my business is standing in front of people and making them laugh, and I want to see how far I can get with that.
- I can sit and write clever things, but that never quite works as well as when I'm just chatting about stupid things in the moment.
- I'm glad Carol Vorderman has left 'Countdown;' I mean, it's not like she did much. She was effectively just an autistic shelf-stacker.
- Making the 'Big Show' has been the most fun I've had on telly.
- I've got some Jewish ancestry and I don't like waste.
- Maybe people just can't cope with how jovial I am.
- One of the positives of getting older is that you forget your age. Then you find out that you're younger than you thought you were.
- Britain's Got Talent' is about those moments when an unknown person takes to the stage and changes their life in the space of a few minutes.
- I usually do quite well with presents, but the problem with Christmas is it's such a big build-up and such a big day that if someone tests you the year after, you've got no idea what you got.
- People have their special room for Christmas. One year my mum left her present on the arm of the sofa and it was still there the following Christmas!
- Success and arena shows are a great anti-depressant.
- Our family home, a large house in Hampstead, was sold to Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne. I remember being told that 'someone who eats bats' was buying it.
- I thought I was going to do some cult, cool, late-night interviewing thing on BBC2. But everyone kept saying: 'No, Michael, you're teatime, you're not cool.'
- I like the stage lights to be bright so I can't see people because I will inevitably only see the ones who aren't laughing.
- I got my big break at the Royal Variety Performance in 2006 and returned in 2008, but now to host it is such an honour and I'm unbelievably excited.
- I don't eat huge amounts, I'm just very lazy. But then this story appeared about me being on a diet and several weeks later I was snapped on holiday with my ''new physique'' on display, which was basically my old physique under a baggy T-shirt. I hadn't been on any diet. But I felt I had to live up to it.
- If I'm honest, I think everything is funny. You've just got to find the right way in. When I'm at my happiest and when I'm really on it, when I feel like I'm really on good form at the moment, everything can be funny.
- Sometimes I worry about things changing and people not liking me any more. As a comedian you do feel like you're walking on a knife edge.
- The last thing you want is for people not to care about what you have to say.
- The only critics who annoy me are the ones who come to my shows even when they're clearly not fans of my work.
- You have to be realistic. Not everyone is going to like you, so you have to focus on the ones who do.
- I get looks like I can't raise my child, but I can.
- There's nothing better than having a bright, blinding light in your face and being guided by big, rolling laughter. There's nothing more encouraging than hearing that huge sound. I've waited my whole life to hear that. You come away with the biggest high of your life.
- Australia is fun, but completely exhausting and confusing because I never get on with the different time zone.
- I think if anyone becomes so obnoxious to believe they could be a national treasure, they just need to go on Twitter and realise they're not. That's there to curtail anybody's confidence.
- It would be nice if I had a faster metabolism, because I love food.
- I just find little things in life funny, it's why I giggle during my shows.
- I call people 'captain' a lot and it makes them feel special. Until they hear me using it for everyone, that is.
- I go to the British Comedy Awards and, you know, quite a few people were making jokes at my expense. It just made me feel awful, because I am there with my wife and she has gone out and bought a dress. And it is my big night and I won, and yet the overriding experience was that of nastiness.
- I don't watch any other comedy, I don't study stand-up as an art.
- The world is in a bit of a state. I don't know how it's happened so quickly but everyone's a bit on edge. I'm not sure that our leaders are doing a great job globally. We're hoping on Trump and Kim Jong-un - these two people who maybe aren't necessarily the sanest.
- I feel a bit weird about turning 40. It makes you feel like you've passed over on to the other side a bit.
- Women like me. Women love me. But not so my wife need worry. Not in a 'he's so hot' type of way. More in a 'come round for a cup of tea' way.
- Men need to be with women otherwise I don't think they really know how to behave. They'll just stare at me and it's awkward, so I scramble around in my mind to say the rudest things I can think of just to get something out of them.
- I don't just like to use punchlines anymore, especially in arenas. They freak me out. There is nothing worse than 15,000 people waiting for a punchline.
- I had a great moment with Michael Buble where I asked him if he could teach me to sing like him and he said why we don't sing together, so we did! It was great because my wife and children came to watch his performance.
- Fame is sexy. And women are meant to find men who are funny sexy. But not me. Absolutely not me. Clearly I just missed the sexy bit.
- I like jokes where people don't stop laughing.
- I never felt like I belong to anything - to any groups of friends. I never really had that.
- I found the idea of trying to create a show that everyone can enjoy really appealing.
- It's hard to see your dad once in a blue moon.
- I definitely wanted a Ferrari 328 - I was obsessive about cars as a kid.
- I'm not going to crack America.
- I always used to want everyone to like me, because it used to hurt so much when people made snidey comments or gave me bad reviews, but I've learnt to deal with it.
- Sometimes it's difficult to laugh at certain things but comedy can help.
- I have no ambitions to act, because I don't know how to.
- I worked every single night, not even caring if I got paid, to get myself known. Within a year I was on the Royal Variety Show and that was it.
- I went to quite a nice school as a kid, where everyone was quite posh, because my dad was making some money.
- I've heard that my father was a really funny man in company, but I never got to see that side of him. I was just 17 when he died, and he didn't know that I was funny.
- I think everyone wants to know why I look like this. These jokes I make about looking Chinese... My mother's from Hungary and my dad was from Canada. There's a lot of immigration in my past.
- It's such a lie that women go for funny men.
- I really, really love stand-up.
- I would never be rude about somebody else in my profession because we all do this same thing. We're just trying to make people laugh.
- I'm thrilled at the continued success of the 'Big Show.'
- I sometimes reflect on my own life on stage and no one laughs, but you have to have faith in it and hope that people will laugh.
- Now I almost overly embrace how weird I am, how I look and how oddly camp I am. It's almost too honest for me because I harboured ambitions to be quite a cool, good-looking guy.
- Comedy provides an escape from the horrors of real life.
- I don't go around straightening pictures or anything like that, but I do obsess about the safety of those I love, particularly the kids.
- I do speak well as I went to a posh school. But I come from no real breeding.
- I was in Starbucks and the person in front of me said: 'Can I have a tall, skinny, black Americano please?' I said: 'Are you ordering coffee or voting in the U.S. elections?'
- I don't understand people who write blogs and have children. You can't stop in the middle of bathtime and say: 'I'm just going to write a load of words - for free.' I won't do it - unless someone wants to commission me.
- Hard audiences tend to be when it's all men. It's when businesses have dos where they're at conferences all day then book a comedian for the evening. They're men of a certain age - basically middle-aged, balding, 50 to 60 years old and I just know I can't make these people laugh hysterically.
- I bought my wife a beautiful diamond ring and I even had it engraved - with the price.
- Ruthlessness is not something that comes easily.
- I don't know how it is with other people's relationships, but my wife is always much more tired than me because she works much harder looking after the children, which is an endless battle - a lot of it is battling with them to stop battling with each other.
- Stand-up comedy is what I do, and it's so rewarding. If you write a joke and tell it to an audience of 15,000 people who laugh their heads off at it, it's the best feeling in the world.
- If you can help it, don't be rude to people. When you're rude about someone and the audience laugh you can't deny that it's a bullying laugh.
- I'm sure there are comedians who make jokes about me, but say something funny, not mean.
- One of the weirdest things about Christmas in this country is that people love to watch 'EastEnders' when everyone's in floods of tears and there's a huge row. I don't know if watching it makes them feel better about their own day. Personally, I would rather try to be a bit more positive!
- I've always felt so unconnected to other comedians.
- I've always found the world funny and enjoy laughing at it, and that's what all comedians do.
- I don't have any writers. I never get a laugh with somebody else's jokes. I can't do it justice.
- A responsive crowd is great - they help you see new things in your comedy.
- My wife is very fit and looking younger every day, whereas I'm looking older day by day.
- My life is spent in hotels, which tend to be quite disappointing if you're in them every night.
- I don't like upsetting people.
