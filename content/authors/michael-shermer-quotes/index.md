- Being deeply knowledgeable on one subject narrows one's focus and increases confidence, but it also blurs dissenting views until they are no longer visible, thereby transforming data collection into bias confirmation and morphing self-deception into self-assurance.
- Tenure in any department is serious business, because it means, essentially, employment for life.
- In the long run, it is better to understand the way the world really is rather than how we would like it to be.
- When religious believers invoke miracles and acts of creation ex nihilo, that is the end of the search for them, whereas for scientists, the identification of such mysteries is only the beginning. Science picks up where theology leaves off.
- In order to displace a prevailing theory or paradigm in science, it is not enough to merely point out what it cannot explain; you have to offer a new theory that explains more data, and do so in a testable way.

- Human history is highly nonlinear and unpredictable.
- The principal barrier to a general acceptance of the monist position is that it is counterintuitive.
- Being a skeptic just means being rational and empirical: thinking and seeing before believing.
- We should be exploring consciousness at the neural level and higher, where the arrow of causal analysis points up toward such principles as emergence and self-organization.
- Dualists hold that body and soul are separate entities and that the soul will continue beyond the existence of the physical body.
- But because we live in an age of science, we have a preoccupation with corroborating our myths.
- Anecdotal thinking comes naturally; science requires training.
- Scientific prayer makes God a celestial lab rat, leading to bad science and worse religion.
- Conspiracies are a perennial favorite for television producers because there is always a receptive audience.
- No single discovery from any of these fields denotes proof of evolution, but together they reveal that life evolved in a certain sequence by a particular process.
- Flawed as they may be, science and the secular Enlightenment values expressed in Western democracies are our best hope for survival.
- The reason people turn to supernatural explanations is that the mind abhors a vacuum of explanation. Because we do not yet have a fully natural explanation for mind and consciousness, people turn to supernatural explanations to fill the void.
- Through no divine design or cosmic plan, we have inherited the mantle of life's caretaker on the earth, the only home we have ever known.
- Mammals are sentient beings that want to live and are afraid to die. Evolution vouchsafed us all with an instinct to survive, reproduce and flourish.
- As a social primate species, we modulate our morals with signals from family, friends and social groups with whom we identify because in our evolutionary past, those attributes helped individuals to survive and reproduce.
- In comparison, Google is brilliant because it uses an algorithm that ranks Web pages by the number of links to them, with those links themselves valued by the number of links to their page of origin.
- Providentially, learned habits can be unlearned, especially in the context of moral groups.
- The reason is that in a group, individual errors on either side of the true figure cancel each other out.
- One of the features of a democracy is the disentanglement of the sacred from the secular because in religiously pluralistic countries, no one can legitimately claim special status by faith membership.
- In principle, skeptics are neither closed-minded nor cynical. We are curious but cautious.
- I always accepted the libertarian position of minimum regulation in the sale and use of firearms because I placed guns under the beneficial rubric of minimal restrictions on individuals.
- We do not just blindly concede control to authorities; instead we follow the cues provided by our moral communities on how best to behave.
- A Hubble Space Telescope photograph of the universe evokes far more awe for creation than light streaming through a stained glass window in a cathedral.
- Science operates in the natural, not the supernatural. In fact, I go so far as to state that there is no such thing as the supernatural or the paranormal.
- Skeptics question the validity of a particular claim by calling for evidence to prove or disprove it.
- I say you don't need religion, or political ideology, to understand human nature. Science reveals that human nature is greedy and selfish, altruistic and helpful.
- Scientists are skeptics. It's unfortunate that the word 'skeptic' has taken on other connotations in the culture involving nihilism and cynicism. Really, in its pure and original meaning, it's just thoughtful inquiry.

- Science is not a thing. It's a verb. It's a way of thinking about things. It's a way of looking for natural explanations for all phenomena.
- But the power of science lies in open publication, which, with the rise of the Internet, is no longer constrained by the price of paper.
- Having a Nobel Prize or being a famous scientist will get you a week to a week and a half, metaphorically speaking, of a hearing for your new idea, but after that, it's going to tank if you don't have the evidence and support for it.
- Plato wove historical fact into literary myth.
- We think of our eyes as video cameras and our brains as blank tapes to be filled with sensory inputs.
- The actual atoms and molecules that make up my brain and body today are not the same ones that I was born with on September 8, 1954, a half-century ago this month.
- Skepticism is not a position that you stake out ahead of time and stick to no matter what.
