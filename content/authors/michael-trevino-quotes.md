- I'm a full-blooded Mexican. My mother was born in Zacatecas, Mexico, and my father - the son of Mexican immigrants - was born near Fresno, California.
- I only eat candy on Halloween. No lie.
- I'm a boxer-briefs guy.
- I would love to dive into an indie film based on the streets of East Los Angeles where I grew up. If that doesn't come my way soon, I think I just might have to write it myself.
- I was brought up bilingual, but there came a point where my mom went back to work and I got a white babysitter, so sadly I lost it. Now I can understand Spanish and put words together, but I don't speak it fluently. I'm ashamed of that.
- When our executive producer, Julie Plec, told me I was going to become a hybrid I got really excited. Because there's a lot of responsibility that comes with that, especially in our world of 'The Vampire Diaries' where Tyler is the first successful hybrid that's made.
- I loved working on '90210,' and I liked playing Ozzy because he was different from everybody else. And it was great because I got a great fan base.
