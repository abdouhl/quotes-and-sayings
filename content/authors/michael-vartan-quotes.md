- I hate gold. I'm sort of a sterling-silver guy.
- I've always loved sports and hockey is a sport I play as much as I can. I love it. In a weird way it's like church and therapy and exercise all rolled up into one. I mean when I play hockey I don't think about anything.
- You never know why or when the next job is coming. I actually like that. It's kind of exciting. I don't punch in. I don't have a 9 to 5 job. When you do work you're lucky enough to go to interesting places and meet mostly interesting and talented people, so it's really a great job if you can work.
- You just have to keep plugging away and if you get lucky enough to get a job, you get one.
- I think the hardest thing about being an actor is between jobs when you don't know and wondering if you'll ever work again. It's kind of a crazy business.
- Every actor will tell you it's so much more fun to play the bad guy because usually those characters are more complex and more broad and more interesting, and have more sides to them.
- I'm not a bling-bling guy; I can't pull it off. I just look like an idiot.
- I wish I were a character actor. Of course, if I played hockey without a mask, I could become one.
- I would rather do movies because I'm very lazy and the hours are much easier.
