- Sure, I watched a lot of Hollywood movies. Maybe I've seen more Hollywood movies than French movies.
- When you're with your wife, you don't say I love you to your wife every day but the ways you look at her and your actions are another way to communicate. Don't focus on dialogue, only focus on what you're expressing.
- Maybe I've seen more Hollywood movies than French movies.
- With silent films, you're better off avoiding irony, because the spectator is your accomplice. It's this pact that leads to emotion being created.
- When you do not have the dialogue to explain things, you will use everything to show and to tell the story. I think that this is what makes you believe that it is impeccable.
- It's a dream for a director, at least to try a studio movie.
- I think we are at the very beginning of high changes, not only in terms of digital film, but in the way the movies will be screened, whether they'll be screened on phones, on computers - on everything.
- I think all the history of the Jewish people is about adaptation.
- I'm very happy in France making movies.
- It's just incredible. When you're French, coming from a non-English language country, you don't even dream about Oscar recognition or nominations. It's just beyond the dream. It's something very, very special and unique. It's the highest recognition any filmmaker could dream of.
- If you try to make a silent movie with a normal script and you just pull out the dialogue, you will have big problems with the actors because you will ask them to tell a story that you don't know.
- To me the recognition of the audience is part of the filmmaking process. When you make a movie, it's for them.
- I only have one obsession - not to be boring.
- The silent movie is an emotional cinema: it's sensory; the fact that you don't go through a text brings you back to a basic way of telling a story predicated on the feelings you have created.
- Godard never sought to be sympathetic.
- I always loved silent movies. I was not a specialist, but I loved them. And when I started directing, I became really fascinated by the format - how it works, the device of the silent movie. It's not the same form of expression as a talkie. The lack of sounds makes you participate in the storytelling.
- I make almost all the decisions on set and have to deal with all the financial aspects.
- When we were making the movie, winning awards for it wasn't the point at all. We didn't even have an American distributor.
- I think being a foreigner and talking about Hollywood allowed me to use some cliches and some references that an American would maybe not use.
- When you write a script that you've felt in your soul for a long time, you can't ask the actors to go through the same emotions. You have to do part of the job to make things as easy as possible for them.
- I don't make films to reproduce reality.
- French people are strange about America, I think.
- I always try to make popular films. Even in black-and-white and silent.
- To work with kids is difficult. To work with non-actors is difficult.
- But sometimes I think you have to try to do things that people don't think are doable.
- You - as a director, you have to do your job, you have to show things, and you don't have to ask the actors to do it, or the dialogue.
- I strongly believe cinema is popular culture. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. That's life.
- It's about storytelling. The story is told through images. So with the cast, I had to make sure that the emotions were readable without sound... I know some great actors, if you turn off the sound, you don't really know what they're saying.
- When you speak of silent movies, everyone thinks of Charlie Chaplin first.
- I love silent cinema but don't hold it sacred. Like any branch of film there are some very boring films alongside the masterpieces.
- But I don't think of myself as a foreigner or a Frenchman! I just think of myself as a director.
- The fact that I made a special movie with an old-fashioned style - even if it's a mix between with modern and old-fashioned things - must mean I feel both ways about change. In a way I'm resisting, but in a way adapting myself to the times.
- I always loved silent movies. I was not a specialist, but I loved them. And when I started directing, I became really fascinated by the format - how it works, the device of the silent movie.
- French cinema audiences usually don't express anything. Certainly not satisfaction.
- What I love is to create a show and for people to enjoy it and be aware that's what it is: a show.
- 'Avatar' is a great movie. I really love it.
- There's always been a struggle with filmmakers between art and industry, and you have to find a balance.
- But I don't think of myself as a foreigner or a Frenchman! I just think of myself as a director. Whether I'm French or Australian or whatever, it's really not important.
- Bernard Herrmann was a genius, a great, great composer.
- I've always been against the idea of dividing films between festival titles and popular movies. I think you can make films that are both.
- Sometimes when an actor says something almost perfect, but you know you have to edit it, if you tell them to change something immediately, it will come out great.
- Anne Wiazemsky wrote two books about her life with Jean-Luc Godard between 1966 and 1969. And I first read the second one, which is about the fall of their love story and their marriage. I immediately thought there was a movie to make with this book because it was so funny, and I thought the love story was very, very touching.
- I made a movie in Morocco. I made a movie in Brazil. I've made commercials all over the world. Every set looks like another set.
- This is the problem with language, and this is what makes silent movies fun, because the connection with them, me or the audience is not with the language. There's no question of interpretation of what we are saying it's just about feeling. You create your own story.
- In France, it's really different the way you live. It's a non-religious country. The public space is not religious; religion is a private thing.
- My ambition with 'Redoubtable' was to make a film that would be aesthetically pleasing, charming, and touching.
- I try to respect the rules of the silent movies and I tried to make signification to make sense, and also the crew were very good and the fact that we shot in LA in the real Hollywood, studios and houses. We shot in the bed of Mary Pickford, and you cannot be any more accurate than that, so that helped a lot.
- I can't force people to agree with me.
- I watched a lot of silent movies. It's a very specific way of writing, which is more of a challenge than the directing. You have to describe images. It's easier to shoot them.
- Some people probably think me telling Godard's story is blasphemy. My friends were worried. But he's not my hero or my god. Godard is like the leader of a sect, and I'm an agnostic.
- I am unusual for a Frenchman - I have absolutely nothing against the United States.
- An idea is something you work on to make it work and a desire is much deeper in a way.
- Silence is a universal language. It's like music or painting.
- Robert DeNiro, who may be the greatest living actor, usually acts in a way which is very stone-faced, like Steve McQueen.
- Actually, I met a lot of directors and most of them have that fantasy to make a silent movie because for directors it's the purest way to tell a story. It's about creating images that tell a story and you don't need dialogue for that.
- Here in France, what we love is Life. And all the pleasures that go with it.
- I thought 'The Artist' was a perfect way to find a good balance. The artistic challenge is obvious because the film is black-and-white and its silent, but I did my best to make the movie accessible and easy to watch. I really don't want to make elitist movies. I really try hard to work for the audience. Audiences are smart. They get everything.
- Even if I make fun of him, I try to portray him as a human being. Sometimes because he's the great Jean-Luc Godard, we see him as a concept.
- When you look at the early-'30s movies, like King Kong, the codes of acting are very similar to those of silent movies. In some of the silent movies - the good ones, the ones done by the best directors - the acting is very, very natural.
- Hollywood is much more than America. Hollywood belongs to all of the planet.
- My life is OK. I live in France. It's a very cool country to make films.
- I watched a lot of silent directors who were absolutely great like John Ford and Fritz Lang, Tod Browning, and also some very modern directors like The Coen Brothers. The directors take the freedom within their own movies to be melodramatic or funny when they chose to be. They do whatever they want and they don't care about the genre.
