- I'm going to miss the wind tunnel between Buildings 3 and 4. The ways in which the parking situation forced me to get 'creative.' Bob Ley and his snide comments. Trey Wingo and his snarky comments. Meeting so many people who I respect the hell out of. And the bizarre if not dysfunctional 'SportsNation' family.

- Boxing is like the Wild West. There are no rules. It's horrible.
- Moving back to New York is perhaps what I'm most excited about. Alternate side of the road parking. Flip flops on the subway. And any food I want, delivered. Sometimes more than once a day.

- My face turns bright red when I run and will stay that way until the next day.
- I believe that the sport of football has set itself up to be in a position where it shows itself in the bigger picture to not really care about women - they don't really care about people of color, but we won't get into that for NFL either - but as a woman I feel like a person who has been marginalized.
- It's Charles Barkley. He's a personality. I don't count him as a journalist.
