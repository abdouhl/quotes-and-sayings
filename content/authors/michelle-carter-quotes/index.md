- Even though I was dealing with all of these health issues, I was still doing well during my season. It wasn't the best season, but it was consistent. And I figured if I could be this consistent when I'm not my best, what happens when I get better, where could I be? So I wanted to see what I would be like on the other side.

- After the 2012 Olympics, I returned to training, but unlike in previous years, my off-season weight gain didn't melt off as soon as I got back to my routine. I was tired, and my clothes weren't fitting. I'd been diagnosed with hypothyroidism, which means my thyroid is underactive, and that slows my metabolism.

- If you are feeling good, you look good, you are confident about yourself, you are going to go out there, and you will rock it.

- My dad never wanted to push what he did on us. It was more, for him, if you chose to do this, then we're going to do it, and we're going to get it right. It was, 'I know how to do it. I'm going to teach you how to do it because I want you to be good at it.'

- I know that God is intentional with everything that He brings to me and what He does for me. I'm not here just to be here. God made me intentionally! He created me on purpose, for a reason! To throw the shot put for sure. That's one of the things I am created to do.
