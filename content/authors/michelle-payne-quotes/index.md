- It's not all about strength, there is so much more involved, getting the horse into a rhythm, getting the horse to try for you, it's being patient and I'm so glad to win Melbourne Cup and hopefully, it will help female jockeys from now on to get more of a go.
- But it's been perfect - where you grew up is where you relax. It's been the most perfect thing to have the country lifestyle again after my fall and after the Melbourne Cup.
- My sisters and brothers come up a fair bit for dinner at home. It's basically a normal life; a normal family home. Dad cooks and we also take turns. If it's my turn, I like to do a roast lamb or spaghetti bolognaise.
- I do believe my mum looks after me, and I feel so much faith thinking that she is riding with me and is with me in everyday life, whenever I need her.
- Racing is a funny industry. One week you can be going terrible and the next week you're on top of the world. So you just keep showing up: I keep working harder to get more opportunities, but what do you do - that's life.
- I had great faith in Prince Of Penzance, from the moment I rode him for the first time.
- It's such a chauvinistic sport, a lot of the owners wanted to kick me off.
- I think it's important for people to see how much more people with Down syndrome can get out of life when given responsibilities.
- It's about technique and getting your horse to stretch for you and to give you everything that it's got.
- The female touch is a lot softer than the guys and some horses just respond better to that. Who's to say we're not stronger in the finish anyway?
- There was an interview with me when I was nine years old. They showed it on the local news and I said: 'I want to win the Melbourne Cup.' My friends used to tease me and make fun of what I said. So, yeah, it was pretty funny I did win it in the end.
- I would like to thank all of the owners, John Richards specifically, I think he is the main man who kept me on Prince Of Penzance, maybe a few of them who wanted to take me off.
- For any child growing up, anything is possible. We were poor growing up and you had to work hard and make it happen for yourself.
- For three months I was brain damaged. I couldn't think like before and I was so scared. I didn't know if I could go on living like that. But it helped that the doctors told me I'd get better and your brain is amazing. It can recover.
- Everybody gets caught up in everything, but at the end of the day we're all just here for a short time, so we may as well enjoy it.
- I used to say to myself when I was seven years old that I couldn't wait to get older so I could make money and buy my own clothes. I had a lot of sisters, so as we got older the hand-me-downs got better, but it wasn't until I was about 15 that I was able to buy my own stuff.
- But many people doubt female riders because they say we're not strong enough.
- Racing is my passion and I've been able to have a good life anyway. I've been able to travel the world, so I'm not complaining.
- I'm working my horses every day and absolutely loving it. I'm training seven horses but I'm looking to build to 16.
- I've worked for some great trainers around the world, including Aidan O'Brien, Luca Cumani, Gai Waterhouse and Peter Moody.
- It's a tough world but female jockeys have been successful so many times that hopefully the perception of riding against the boys will change and we will gain more opportunities.
- Then we went across the line, and I was like 'Oh my god, we just won the Melbourne Cup.'
- I always grew up thinking how amazing my dad was, how strong he was.
