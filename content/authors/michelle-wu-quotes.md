- Boston's future depends on taking the lessons from the coronavirus pandemic to tackle big challenges.

- Carving out space for protected bike lanes is the most cost-effective way to increase our transit capacity and move more people on our streets.
- The City of Boston and the T need each other. From designating bus-only lanes to implementing transit signal priority, the MBTA and Boston Transportation Department must work together like never before to unclog roads and keep riders on buses and the Green Line moving - for the health of the entire region.
- I am painfully familiar with the impossible juggle for caretakers trying to navigate language and cultural barriers, insurance pitfalls, and their own unyielding work schedules - only to be heartbroken by the limits of medical treatment.
