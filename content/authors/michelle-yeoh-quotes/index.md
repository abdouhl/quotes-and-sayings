- India is a great talent pool of actors. I see Freida Pinto making it big in Hollywood, and I am sure many others can also make it.
- As an actor, you are always looking for roles that will challenge you, and when I came upon Aung San Suu Kyi, it wasn't just about that but also about stepping into the shoes of someone who means so much to millions of people.
- As an actress, you know there are limitations on what you can do creatively.
- For me, the director is the most important thing. He is steering the boat. If you don't trust him, you won't be able to give him your all.
- I gravitate towards roles where women find strength in very difficult, uncompromising situations but maintain clarity in mind, discipline at heart, and a certain strength in spirit.
