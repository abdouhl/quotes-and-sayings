- If everything else falls apart and I'm broke, in 20 years I'll still be able to do 'Twin Peaks' conventions.
- Big Stephen King fan. I think he's dismissed often as a hack probably because of his prolific body of work, but he's anything but. I think he's a terrific writer. And not just a genre writer; he really approaches a number of complexities in everything he writes. So I'm a huge fan.

- 'RoboCop' was maybe the best summer of my entire life.
- Maybe I was intimidated by my father's talent and success.

- I didn't sing, but I did play the drums.
- 'The Stand' was great. Adapted by Stephen King from his massive book.

- I'm not really a guy who draws on things from my own past. I think if you're a competent actor with a good imagination, and if it's on the page, it makes your job a lot easier. If it's well written, it allows your imagination to run wild and draw inspiration from that.
