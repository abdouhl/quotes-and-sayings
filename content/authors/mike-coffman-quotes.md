- What is interesting in Washington, D.C., is I've never missed a vote. The veterans' committee keeps track of hearings, and I've never missed a hearing or a vote on the VA committee.
- I just think that Stephen Miller is completely tone deaf when it comes to reforming our immigration system.
- People ask me, 'What do you think about Trump?' Honestly, I don't care for him much.
- Low-wage individuals barely get anything. I think we have to reward work, and I do think that we need to bump up the earned income tax credit to help low-wage workers.
- I think partisanship is probably the greatest problem in Washington, D.C.
- Elected officials have always been held to a higher standard, as we should be.
- I can't spread myself too thin.
- You have a losing team, you change the coach.
- Midterms behave very differently than presidential elections. Midterms, for a federal candidate, often times are a referendum on the president, where in presidential years, voters make two separate choices: one for president and one for a federal officeholder.
- If there is anyone who knows what a rigged system looks like, it's Donald Trump, who was able to evade the draft during the height of the Vietnam War when the U.S. was losing on average 1,000 troops every month. That system was clearly rigged in favor of young men from politically influential families, but Donald Trump never complained about that.
- Both Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump have tapped into a legitimate anger about the failures of Washington, but instead of running a campaign built on a positive vision for overcoming these failures, Donald Trump has conducted a polarizing and divisive campaign.

- There's a narrative out there about Republicans being not just anti-illegal immigrant, but anti-immigrant. It was very important to me to break the narrative.
- I don't know how you can govern without ever compromising.
- Hillary Clinton is a non-starter and lacks the integrity to lead this nation, but Trump has a long way to go to earn the support of many - me included.
- I do think that we need more of a balance between merit-based and familial-based immigration.
- The frustration of Washington is you have to concentrate on just a few areas to really make a difference, and then so much of the power is at the top, at the committee chairman level.
- I believe President Obama loves this country and wakes up every morning trying to do what is best for our nation, even if I disagree with his approach.
- I love the diversity of my district, and it does drive a fair amount of my work.
- On Sundays, I usually go to church with my mother.
- The Dream Act will be a nightmare for the American people. No doubt, we need immigration reform, but the Dream Act is written far too broadly, and it will only encourage more illegal immigration, promote chain migration, and will be a magnet for fraud.
- I don't know whether Barack Obama was born in the United States of America. I don't know that. But I do know this: that in his heart, he's not an American. He's just not an American.
- We have to get control of our borders.
- I am a Marine Corps veteran, but more importantly - or as important maybe - I'm the chairman of the Oversight Investigation Subcommittee and the House Veterans Affair Committee.
- The truth is, we are all human, and we all make mistakes.
- Since the issues surrounding President Obama's birth certificate began during his campaign in 2008, I have rejected the notion that he is anything other than American.
- I think we need to go to a system... where we have tough enforcement. Where if you're here illegally, you're going to be deported.
- It's too bad we can't take VA leadership and export it and give it to some of our adversaries around the planet. Let them suffer under VA's leadership.
