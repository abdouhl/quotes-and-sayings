- I get the job with the 49ers, and I'm four years removed from my high school coaching days, and I'm going to be coaching Joe Montana, and I'm going, 'How do I approach this? How am I going to do this?'
- I never had anything planned, like, 'When I'm 40 I'll be coaching here.' A number of people in our profession have done that, but my thing was always, wherever I was coaching, to work hard, do the best you can, and if it happens, it happens.
- I probably won't coach again. I really know what it takes to coach... the time necessary, the emotion... to do it correctly. Unless I was 100 percent sure I wanted to commit, I don't think you're being fair to anybody.
- If you keep working at something and stay with it, eventually good things will happen to you.
- You've got to find the quarterback. Once you find the quarterback, you can fix the other things.
- I'm a football coach. It seems the league is cyclical and hiring young guys... but experience in the NFL still means a heck of a lot.
- Coaches who want to coach in the NFL usually don't go to the high school level for 10 years. They know where they want to go early.

- The important thing, I think, going into any organization, is that all of the principles, all of the decision-makers are pointed in the same direction, with the same motives, the same desires, and then you have a chance.
- Every organization is looking for... a guy who can be the coach for the next 10, 15 years. That's what they want. I get that.
- I left Green Bay for Seattle in 1999. I wonder what would have happened had I stayed in Green Bay, where I've got one of the best quarterbacks of all time in his prime.
- When I was coaching, I was out there, and you're doing press conferences, and the fans see a lot more of the head coach than they do either the general manager or the president.
- I took a leave of absence for a year to coach at San Francisco State under Vic Rowen, fully intending to go back to high school.
- The fans are very, very important in the team's success. Instead of acting up, you're cheering for the team.
- If I hire a coach, he's the coach and will run what he knows and is comfortable with. Will it be part of the process? Absolutely. But I am not going to interfere that way as the president.
- I was teaching history and coaching both tennis and track along with football. I felt like I had the best of both worlds. I was pretty comfortable. I thought I would be doing what I was doing for the rest of my life.

- It's special for me to coach the team Lombardi coached.
- I still love Colt McCoy, but I will always try and do what I think we have to do to make the team better and to improve ourselves.
- The mentor thing is overblown to me. I'm going to coach the player. I'm not going to have another player coach the player. They can be friends but when it comes to what I want him to do on the football field, that's my call, not another player's call.
- I was raised, right or wrong, you make a decision and you don't quit. You fight your way through it; that's what you did.

- I think one of my strengths is kind of knowing people and getting a good read and a feel for what that person's strengths might be.
- I think I'm a pretty good coach, but there are a lot of good coaches, a lot of young coaches.
- When you walk in the door at Green Bay and see the murals of all the football players you knew as a fan, it can get to you. I grew up being Bart Starr and Paul Hornung on the playground.
- You put a tremendous amount of energy, your whole body and soul into something, and you need to win once in a while. Otherwise, it becomes too hard.
- I had a rule - I didn't have a lot of rules - and one of them was we're going to operate from a mutual respect. I won't embarrass you, and I don't expect you to be embarrass me.
- My football do-over is when I went to Seattle and had both jobs as coach and general manager.
- People ask me often, 'Why did you leave Green Bay? You had the best quarterback, you were going good and all that.' But I've always been one for challenges. Try to build something up, try something new, challenge myself.
- I always could go into restaurants in Chicago, and nobody would throw anything at me. There are people there who might not like me, but I think they respect me.
- As an organization, I think you owe it to the vast majority of people who go to the game and want to watch the game and enjoy the game and feel good about bringing their kids or their wife or their grandma to the game.

- It doesn't matter what you know if you can't teach it.
