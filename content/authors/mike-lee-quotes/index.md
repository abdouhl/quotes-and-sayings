- Do we want more of the same regulatory mission creep that has helped to harm America's poor and middle class? Do we want more of the policies that have stifled growth? Or do we want something else, something different, something that focuses on the need to reevaluate the size, the scope, the cost, the reach of the federal government?
- My purpose is to call on my colleagues, whether they're Republicans or Democrats, to get behind the agenda of trying to reform the government and make it work for the people rather than the other way around.

- The best thing we can do when we want to elevate civil dialogue in our American political discourse is to do whatever we can to make sure we treat others kindly with dignity and respect, and that's what I intend to do.

- You know, in a business, you have to operate on the basis of voluntary investment by individuals in a cause. With government, there is no voluntary effort to invest capital. It's just taken and invested. And the same accountability is not at play. The same natural forces in the economy are not at play.
- I think declaring a no fly zone over foreign soil is tantamount to an act of war.
- I think I was about 30 before I realized that not every family talks about the presentment clause on a regular basis.
- The Tea Party movement as I perceive it is all about recognizing the difference between state and federal powers. And that there are limits to federal power that need to be respected.
- We've got tax and regulatory policies in this country that are driving a lot of businesses overseas, and so I think there's a lot that we can do using principles of constitutionally limited government to help address people who share these concerns.
- Whether it's a penalty or a tax, it's all one in the same. It's coming out of somebody's hard-earned money in their pocketbooks and that's the point. So in some ways, to me, it's a distinction without a difference.
- There's a lot of bipartisan rancor, a lot of excessive delegation of legislative power from the legislative branch to the executive branch.
- We can't legislate the creation of jobs, but we can legislate things that will allow jobs to be created.
- At any given time, when there is a Republican president, typically we regard that person as the leader of the Republican Party.
- It is simply science fiction fantasy to say that, if you do not raise the debt ceiling, that everything is going to collapse.
- When you have a country that's been accustomed to government spending at a certain level, it is really hard to ratchet it back.
- I would vote against raising the national debt ceiling. Again, this is about mortgaging the future of unborn generations of Americans. It's a form of taxation without representation. I don't think we can do that.

- The founding generation would be amazed. It would be surprised. I think it would be very impressed by what has happened since then in terms of our exploding population; in terms of the success of this country economically and otherwise.
- We have brought down emissions in this country through our legal system and through technological innovation. We can do this on our own. We don't have to have the permission of countries all over the world to do that.

- The American people want a balanced budget. They want Congress to stop this barbaric practice of perpetual deficit spending. It really, if you think about it, is a form of taxation without representation. We fought a war over that issue and we won that war.
- I don't want a government shutdown. I don't think anyone does.
- If we were all to chase every squirrel that comes running along in the form of a personal dispute or a mischaracterization of someone, or someone's integrity or intent, we'd be very busy doing that and not focusing on the government, on that which we need to reform internally.
