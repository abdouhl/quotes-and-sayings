- It's kind of crazy how one thing can lead to another if you keep your eyes open to it.

- Sometimes people say, 'Oh, you're doing better now than before the accident.'That irritates the hell out of me.

- I loved to go hunting out in the woods and hiking, and that's just not easy anymore. For me, to walk up and down hills in the rough terrain, it just doesn't work very well. It can, but it's three times as hard as it used to be.
- Never did I ever think I would be competing on a snowboard out here in X Games.
- Having already used a Fox shock in my Moto Knee, the prosthetic leg I developed, I knew that I would take advantage of Fox's superior suspension dynamics in the Versa Foot as well.
- For the most part, if you're willing to work hard enough, you can recover from most injuries. Having that mentality really helps you keep moving forward.

- Fox and I go way back... I got to know the Fox folks pretty well as the result of spending time at races with them over the years.
- When you walk, you need the leg to swing back and forth underneath you. It needs to flex at a certain point, then extend as you follow through your gait. Now, that function doesn't really help at all while I'm standing on my dirt bike or snowmobile.
- A lot of the jobs I had revolved around metal fabrication and creating and building and maintaining equipment.
- I didn't even think about snowboarding until after my accident.

- For my equipment, we're not about running. We're about wheels, action sports, and that type of thing. So we want range of motion and shock absorption. The foot itself has 28 degrees of ankle motion as you press into it or you put weight into it. A typical running or walking foot has kind of around 10 to 12, at max, flex at the toe.
