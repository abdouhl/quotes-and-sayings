- You learn more every season and that enables you to be a better player.

- I have never judged myself by how anyone else has played.
- I'm about 255, but I'd weigh under 220 if I weren't in football. In the hot summer, I feel the extra weight is taxing on my respiratory system. I don't mind it in the winter.

- That's what you realize when you get older, how much you love the game and what a great game it is.
- I hate those domed stadiums because the air is goofed up. There's no fresh air, and you almost feel like you have claustrophobia.
- The only way I can have a positive impact on this football team is for me to dedicate myself to doing my job.
- I'm not a big man and never was. I came in at about 243 pounds and I played at times up to 260 so there was nothing I could have done to match the size of the defensive tackles.

- My only obligation as a professional is to be prepared and be as good as I can be at my position.
- I was pretty darn lucky to be selected by the Steelers. A round earlier or later in the draft and I might have been with a team that didn't make it to the Super Bowl.
- Playing with a man over me in a 34 type defense really doesn't change what I have to do. You still have to play aggressive football and execute. No matter what the front, I think strength gives me a little edge.
