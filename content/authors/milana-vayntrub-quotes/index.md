- My directing opportunities have been awesome, and my acting opportunities, some have been great and some have not.
- In the '80s, we were living in the U.S.S.R., where anti-Semitism was a deeply ingrained part of the culture. Being a Jewish person in the Soviet Union was not easy. Not that I remember any of that - I was barely old enough to chew back then - but for my parents, both Uzbekistan-born Jews, life was a struggle.
- The goal of Can't Do Nothing is to ask people, what matters for you? And whatever it is, what are you doing about it? How bad does it need to get before you take action?
- I would love to keep directing commercials. I love it so much. I love working with brands and ad agencies and old white men who have been doing this for 60 years.

- Being an immigrant myself, but feeling very American, and also being the child of immigrants, I understand the feeling of wanting a home.
- You can't say that we need to give women more roles, and then when we do, say that they're only there because men want to look at them.
- I remember what it was like when my parents couldn't help me with my homework because they couldn't speak the language, or being a translator for my parents. I did that a lot.
- I did a commercial for a phone company when I was five. But my first big thing was when I was eight. I was on the first season of 'E.R.'
- Nobody is powerless.
- Comedy came early. I knew when I was a kid that I was silly, and I knew that I liked people who were funny, but I don't think I knew I was funny. I didn't really think about it.
- I do know what it's like to be an outsider.
- Commercial directing felt like a very natural transition from my comedy, sketch, music video directing experience.
- The AT&T commercials are the most fun acting opportunity that anyone could ask for. That being said, directing exercises a part of my brain that is really fun that I don't get to try out as an actor.
- I'm not really into sci-fi movies, but I'm into the science of space a lot. I love astronomy and thinking about the nothingness of the everythingness of space.
- We're so lucky to take being alive for granted.
- In the late '80s, the U.S.S.R. loosened its restrictions on immigration. When the government was like, 'Y'all wanna bounce?' my family, along with tens of thousands of other Jews ran for the door in an attempt to make a better life in America.
- I'm a real nerd for science. I love Neil deGrasse Tyson and 'Cosmos' and all that.
- My grandmother was a nanny for an Orthodox Jewish family, and she would come home and tell us about that.
- I want to be able to enjoy my life to the fullest so I can add something to the lives of people around me.
- I think working with kids and seeing how kids are universally children - no matter what you do, they love playing on a bongo and they love drawing and they love playing - that is a great uniter.

- Every opportunity I've had to work and act with incredibly talented directors, like Dean Holland was on 'Love,' and the writers and creators of that show, Judd Apatow, Paul Rust and Leslie Arfin, have been incredible learning experiences that have informed my creative process.
- When I direct - everything I've directed has had improv in it, because I think there's something special in a performance the first time it's said out loud that's hard to recreate.
