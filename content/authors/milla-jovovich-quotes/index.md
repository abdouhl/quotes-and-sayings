- I am a strong Ukrainian girl, that is why I work a lot.
- At the age of 16 I was already dreaming of having a baby because I felt myself to be an adult, but my mum forbid it. Right now, I feel like a teenager and I want to have fun for one or two more years before starting a family.
- Lots of pretty faces came and went over the years, but some stuck around and I happen to be one of them.
- I really only have a few friends.
- There is all this controversy that women and girls are too skinny or too overweight. I say to just do martial arts and everything will be okay. You will tone up your body and find a confidence you can't find just sitting around watching TV and hanging out with friends.
- People say that I'm always late, but that's a myth.
- I thought that being popular in school was just so pathetic. I knew I had a future over and beyond the horizon of that school.
- It's going to seem idiotic to say this, but I think that at a given moment we all need a place to ourselves where we can refuge ourselves and cut ourselves off from the world.
- Scratch a Russian, and you'll find a peasant.
- During the day I force myself to at least eat some salads rather than rubbish, and a steak in the evening. In fact, I eat to basically satisfy my hunger. I hardly have the time to appreciate a meal, and I'm everything, but a gourmet.
- My poor mum had a lot of problems with me around that time. I was young but I'd been working for years, so if she asked me to clean my room I'd say, 'You can't tell me what to do after I've worked a 12-hour day.' It gave me a power that no one that age should have.
- I'm not really easy to live with! There needs to be unlimited patience and unconditional love. Men I've known before loved my independent spirit and were proud of my success, to the point that they'd become jealous of the time I devote to my career.
- From childhood my mother had me examining Robert Mapplethorpe's style and Egon Schiele's framing - that's what modelling is about.
- Rather than go to the gym, I would prefer to do martial arts because the time goes by quicker.
- Modelling killed me.
- I just want to make one really good movie a year. And when I die, to know I was honest as an artist.
- From now on, I approach the cinema as a business woman. I intend to be in more action movies because, apart from Angelina Jolie, no other actress stands out in this genre.
- Why have a model on the front of your magazine when you can have Kate Winslet, Cate Blanchett or Hilary Swank? Because those girls are intelligent and talented, people are interested.
- I feel like movie stars don't have many friends at all. They have acquaintances.
- My regular life today is reading books, making dolls houses, sewing dolls with my daughter and barbequing.
- When I learn martial arts, my master will have me try a punch for a week and he will keep saying, 'No, you don't have it. No, that's not right.' When he finally says, 'Yes, you did it,' it's a wonderful moment. You worked on it. You got it.
- I intend to be in more action movies because, apart from Angelina Jolie, no other actress stands out in this genre.
- Before, being a model, it was just a job, and I was making fun of it. But today, I take my career more seriously. The fact that a reader may buy an Armani item because she'd seen it on me in a magazine is very important to me. So much so that I intend to launch my own label.
- I love making independent movies, and that's pretty much what I'm going to be doing for the rest of my years.
- I think that's one of the only reasons God created celebrities. To help those who can't help themselves.
