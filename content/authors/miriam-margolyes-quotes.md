- Everything's harder for women: harder to start, to stay employed, to run a life with a family.
- With television, attention spans have been shortened. It's something we have to fight against: the dumbing down of the audience. To be part of an audience is a privilege. To be with the people on stage, to let them reach you. If you're doing a million other things, they won't reach you.
- I enjoy finding the right word and giving each its full measure, its full space in a sentence.

- I have a class prejudice - against the upper class, which is foolish.
- I don't think people realise how important it is to have your blood pressure checked. Stroke is so sudden, so catastrophic.
- Mummy was absolutely the rock in my life. It was not that I didn't love my father; he was such a quiet man, and she was not. She was the most vivid person I have ever known. She was accomplished and brave and fearless. She used to say to me, 'I want you to be able to talk to anyone about anything.'

- Israel is stupid for allowing people to vent their anti-Semitism.
- People tend to think I'm funny and fluffy, but I can switch on a sixpence from extreme happiness to utter despair. I'm aware that doesn't make it easy for people sometimes.

- I don't like religion.
- The main fear about growing old as an actor is not losing the looks. I never had any to speak of, and what I had I've still got, but losing the memory is another matter.

- Communication is something we all take for granted.
- I want to explore the range of emotions it is possible to feel.

- The first piece of property that I bought was in Tuscany in 1973.
- I cannot accept violence.
- I'm not a comedian, but I do make people laugh. I'm good at it.
- Sydney has taken my money, Melbourne has my respect, but Adelaide has taken my heart; I shall return.

- My looks have changed, but I was never beautiful, so I'm not any less beautiful now.
