- I think it is a good challenge when you have different balls in different countries. Naturally, it is a bit of skill to adapt quicker than the opposition in different conditions. It is an interesting debate, one that is thankfully not in my hands.
- Selfishly, it's been really nice to have a period of time where you can have a home routine and feel pretty normal, in a way.
- I have got height so I am little bit too tall for 'keeping.
- I think it was Under-16 when I started really focusing on bowling and trying to work out how I was going to go about my bowling and that sort of thing.
- If they're going to take away a portion of maintaining the ball, there needs to be that even contest between bat and ball, otherwise people are going to stop watching and kids aren't going to want to be bowlers.
- Away series are always the hardest to win.
- It's hard enough juggling one cricket schedule with three formats let alone when my wife plays cricket on a completely different schedule as well. Something I take into consideration heavily is being able to spend time together.
- When you're stuck in situations like that, month after month, going from bubble to bubble, and if those restrictions remain the same or quite similar, it can be quite tiresome on the mind and body as well.
- I guess my game plan in ODI cricket is very set with the new ball and at the death. In Test cricket, you have to bowl longer and batsmen don't have to score as quickly. But at the same time, as a bowler, you can bring in some aspects of one format to the other format.
- There are certain aspects that cross over from ODIs to Tests. Tactically, they are quite different and you are a lot longer in the game. It is more like a war of attrition and you think tactically as bowlers.
- That contest between bat and ball, we don't want to lose that or get further away from that even contest.
