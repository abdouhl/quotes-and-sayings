- In 2014, my first year as an England player, I got booed by some India fans at Edgbaston every time the ball went near me.
- I think a lot of people do see me as like a role model or as an ambassador.
- Representing England has always been a privilege and my decision to take a break from Test cricket at the end of the home summer was made to ensure that, hopefully, I can do it for a lot longer.
- I never thought I'd be a senior player in a county side, let alone the England side. When you break into a county side, that is your aim, so it's an incredible feeling to have achieved that with England.
- When we get to the third and fourth generation immigrant families and beyond there will be more England supporters among them, maybe even the majority. I have had British Asians tell me they support England because of me or Adil Rashid and that's great to hear.
- Obviously as players we want to play every game. But when you do miss out, I strongly believe the job is to not sulk and make things uncomfortable for those picked or the captain.
- No matter where I bat I try to adapt to the situation.
- If they come after me and my bowling you get a bit down. But when I am fielding I think about it and there are worse things that can happen. I take in the atmosphere a bit and think this is not too bad.
- In an ideal world, you knock the runs off and win the game.
- And in an Ashes series the best approach as a player is to not get caught up in feeling pressure for your position but to think only about the greater cause. How can I contribute? It could be a single moment, like a blinding catch or a run out. Think only of the team's needs.
- My dad always wanted me to be a cricketer, study no chance. Once he saw that I was quite good for my age, no school. So, as soon as I did my GCSEs, I got signed by Warwickshire at 15.
- I needed to step back from cricket, international cricket in particular, just to get away from the scrutiny and intensity of everything. I love it but it was too much for me.
- From nine, I started playing cricket. From 11, I knew this is what I'm doing.
- I needed to step back from cricket, international cricket in particular, to get away from the scrutiny and intensity. I love it but it was too much for me.
- I talk quite a lot in the changing room, try and joke around, keep the energy going, try to lift guys if they are struggling, even if I am struggling.
- In the nets, Joe Root hits the most sixes. He tries to take us down all the time. I think everyone is capable of hitting big sixes and I think I'm the best of all of them. But Jos is the one guy that everyone knows is out front. Jos is power with timing.
- My dad and uncle were so protective so whenever someone would say or do something to harm us they were right there. They were very shy but you cross a line with them and the temper can get quite rough.
- If I wasn't doing this, I'd be working in a chippy. Cricket can change your life. It can teach you a lot about discipline and life in general.
- People make mistakes along the way. Cricket means I may not always be there for everyone all the time. But when I take the field for my country, I know there are a lot of people I am representing.
- When you go into cricket you have to be streetwise.
- I grew up playing against friends and cousins in the park and it was some of the most competitive cricket I have played.
- There's a lot of misunderstanding out there, particularly in the difference between religion and culture. For example, I hear people criticise Islam for arranged marriages, but that's nothing to do with Islam. It is the culture in some places, but it's actually against Islam.
- I know how much of a uniting game cricket is and as a leader of the Birmingham Phoenix that is something I definitely want to promote.
- I always have a slight sense of sadness when Ramadan ends. It's such an amazing, blessed month. For me it is like a training camp for the year. You reflect on your life and things you can improve on. And it's not about food and drink, it's about learning to be a better person.
- People have the right to support who they want of course but I'm hoping in the future maybe they or their kids will become England fans and players.
- It took a lot of sacrifice from my dad. He managed to put cricket nets in our garden because he knew we had to practise every day. That would also keep us away from the streets.
- People have been saying life will change for us now but me? No chance. I may be a World Cup winner but I will always be the lad who played cricket with his friends and cousins in the park on Stoney Lane in south Birmingham using an old milk crate for stumps.
- Difference is respected and the environment Eoin Morgan has created is such that we are encouraged to transfer our personalities into our cricket.
- I know my responsibilities. They are to my religion, my parents, my wife, my family and my community.
- Runs are important, don't get me wrong, but it will be wickets that I will be judged on.
- When you're quiet, others can form opinions that are way off the mark.
- Mistakes can happen. Sometimes they can build up over the course of an innings and put people even more on edge, which makes it snowball further.
- Religion is very important to me. One of my aims is to try to show that you can have faith and play cricket. There can be a lot of negativity and misunderstanding of Islam.
- Sometimes it can feel like my bad days in Test cricket get amplified or singled out more than other players, while my good ones can fly under the radar. I'm not making excuses but over time this can get to you a little bit.
- If I can play, and change the mind of one person about being a Muslim player and having a beard, then I'll feel as if I've done my job.
- Through county cricket all the way up to international cricket, the individual needs to be responsible for his behaviour.
- I am a Muslim, yes, but I am also very English. People don't realise how proud I am to be representing my country or being from Birmingham.
- To be part of a World Cup=winning squad was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. There was no resentment or sadness from missing the later games.
- It's always nice to get a call-up when in decent nick as you can have that confidence coming into the game. It's what county cricket should do.
- I have been told in the past that's my downfall but I'd rather be too nice to be honest. I set out in cricket to make friends. I'd rather people say they enjoyed playing with him and he's a good guy, not he's a good player but a bit of a so and so.
- We want cricket to grow for kids, and for families to come and watch.
- I wear the beard as a label. I want people to know I am a Muslim and I want people to know I am representing the Muslim faith. I want to show that you can practise your faith and still play cricket to a high level.
- I've opened throughout most of my career at Worcester. I understand there are guys in the team who have opened for a long time, more than me, with better records than me.
- Social media is one of the hardest things about playing for England.
- I have been up and down the batting order and it's difficult. People don't always realise that.
- I have played quite a few Test matches in the back garden with my two brothers.
- My beliefs are that good people who work hard get their rewards. There will be struggle at times and hurdles along the way - life throws up all sorts - but in the end, you will prevail if you stick to the right path.
- We're just having a lot of fun and ripping each other all the time. We get stuck into each other about everything: about the football or about Fifa. Anything. It's all part of team bonding. It's all very natural.
- I've not experienced racism from other players. Not once. You experience ignorance but that's not the same at all, and I'm always happy to discuss things. If that helps people learn about Islam, to learn there's nothing to fear, then great, that's all part of my role.
- We all played in my family and cricket has always been in the blood.
- All I care about is England doing well and if that means I'm looking on for a bit, I won't lose any sleep.
- I think my dad always believed I would play for England, probably more than I believed it, but it never crossed our minds that we weren't going to make it.
- People get involved not just in politics but in groups and sects and... forget the main reason why we're here: to worship Allah.
- I was just a normal teenager, going out with my friends, enjoying my time. I didn't really believe in anything, I didn't fast or pray.
- Every time that I come to Edgbaston it takes me back to some great first memories of coming here at a very young age.
- I like to see the kids in my area wearing England shirts, not Pakistan or India ones. A lot of it comes from the older generations but it's changing slowly, especially if people like myself and Ravi Bopara are playing for England.
- I was so fortunate to play my club cricket at Moseley Ashfield. We had loads of Asians, white players, black players. You grow up from that knowing it just doesn't matter what religion or culture people are into, everyone is different.
- In terms of trying to inspire other people with faith to play and stuff I am very proud of that. I remember seeing Muslim athletes or guys with other faiths performing and still carrying the label of being a religious person and it does inspire people.
- I'm 32 now. I'm getting old. It's gone in the blink of an eye. But I won't even look back at the number of caps when I'm done: the most important thing will be remembering all the fun I've had with the guys in the dressing room and the friends I've made.
- The England team is made up of good people, first and foremost, and we are a very multicultural side, too. I believe we represent our country well and our diversity is one of our strengths.
- As cricketers and professionals, with the scrutiny that is on us, we have to obviously be careful and behave ourselves.
- Babies are born every day but truly, each one is a little miracle.
- The moment we won the World Cup is one I will never forget and would do anything just to experience again. It was the most euphoric sporting sensation you could possibly imagine.
- When I look back on my career in years to come I will be proud to say I did not just play in a good England team but one with good people, too.
- In tournament cricket, with a new opponent each game, I think you actually need to play to your own strengths more.
- That's the best thing: just being part of the team.
- I'm not a massive reader of online comments but I come across the odd comment where people still question if I'm English. I find that so silly.
- Being English, being born in England, this is our home and we should be supporting our home country.
- I don't want anyone to think I don't love playing for England because playing for your country is the greatest thing a cricketer can do.
- Since my international debut in 2014 the miles on the clock have probably crept up and Test cricket is the level where the pressure and scrutiny are greatest.
- Cricket can produce some amazing feelings on the field and I have been lucky enough to experience a few along the way.
- I've always said it's just a game of cricket. The only pressure I get is when I feel I've let the team down.
- But I think my dad's academy is one of the best. The first reason he does it is to take people away from the streets and doing all the wrong stuff and for those kids to learn a range of skills.
- Yes, I see myself as a role model. And as a role model, I have to behave in a certain way.
- I coach for my dad's academy. Sometimes it's just about being there - it's not just the coaching - it's seeing that you are there to inspire or they are trying to impress you.
- I have always been a player whose form goes up and down but at the moment I feel my batting confidence is at its lowest. Negative comments can affect you and they probably have.
- You have family and kids, you get home and they want to play with you but you just end up on your phone. I caught myself doing that when my little one wanted a kickaround and I decided I'd had enough.
- It's not easy for a player who considers him or herself to be a proper batter to then adjust down the order. Put anyone there and the scores won't necessarily come. You can lose a bit of love for it, too.
- In Twenty20 it's not always about straight drives and high elbows. It's amazing how far you can hit the ball. I've always been able to hit the ball far but not consistently like I have in practice over here. I'm enjoying it so much.
- A lot of the Indian supporters would have been born in Birmingham, have Birmingham accents. It is my home city as well. Second, third generations from the sub-continent still support India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
- Yuzvendra Chahal, India's leg-spinner, is another IPL teammate. He's also a great guy and very funny.
- Look at a player like Divock Origi. No one was talking about the guy and then suddenly he becomes a hero.
- If someone dares me to do something I'll just do it.
- I know people aren't sure about men who look like I do. People don't see the beard as a bit of hair. I've been shouted at, called some horrible names, and when I first came to Worcester I noticed people crossing the road to avoid me.
- Sometimes in Asian homes it is all about where we've come from, which is important too, but it is about where you live and where you're born and the people who are the same as you.
- No. 7 is not an easy position. The way you play is dictated by the pace of the game and you have to try to get quick runs. Even top players like Jos Buttler and Ben Stokes find it hard.
- With young kids watching and hearing the news, we have to be on our best behaviour. I think it's really important that we inspire the younger generation to take up the game. It could turn them away. That's not what we want.
- I know personally as a young player when coaches came to my school that is someone you want to be like and I think that helps massively.
- You do your best but I think I'm going to try and get back in as a batsman first, spinner second.
- Coming on to bowl in the opening powerplay might look stressful for a spinner but I actually quite like it.
- I'd never go up to somebody and start preaching, but if somebody asks I'm willing to talk about it. Often, after people have seen me praying, they'll ask and it's a chance to show how normal prayer time is and why we do it, to teach people about the religion. Not to try to change them, but to explain.
- We're a tight-knit city in Birmingham. We have so much around us that brings the people together, no matter who you are or your background.
- When shots are going for six and you're playing well, everyone is trying to big you up. Mis=hit one, get out, all the negative people come out.
- I never get too over-confident, or too down. I just go with the flow.
- Respect is having respect for the people you play with and against, and respect for the shirt. Unity is about sticking together but also uniting the country. That was always the bigger cause for us, not just the cricket.
- In sport, the underdog does come out on top quite a bit.
- I hope what people see in me is that I'm a normal guy, and that people who look as I do can do normal things.
