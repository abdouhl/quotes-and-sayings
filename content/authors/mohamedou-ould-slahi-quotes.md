- I'm afraid to apply for a visa to the U.S.A. because it's against terrorism in a very undemocratic way.
- But the problem is that you cannot just admit to something you haven't done; you need to deliver the details, which you can't when you haven't done anything. It's not just, Yes, I did!' No, it doesn't work that way: you have to make up a complete story that makes sense to the dumbest dummies.

- I started to hallucinate and hear voices as clear as crystal. I heard my family in a casual familial conversation I heard Koran readings in a heavenly voice. I heard music from my country.

All that is left is for people who survived Guantanamo Bay to speak for people who are left behind, and speak for those who are in so many Guantanamos, plural, in my part of the world.
