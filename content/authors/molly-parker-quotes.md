- In general, costumes are the first thing in life that let other people know who we are. They indicate who the person is without saying anything.
- I still don't look like what I think I look like.
- I think a lot of actors are overly concerned about being well liked in the parts they play.
- I think it's damaging to know too much about a person, about an actor.
- I've always tried to be conscious of how I represent women in my work. They don't have to be good or strong women, but they have to be complex.
- The landscape you grow up in speaks to you in a way that nowhere else does.
- Sex, sexual dynamics and how we define our sexuality, is one of the major deals in everyone's life.
- I really understand where Alice is coming from - I've been in exactly the same place coming from a small town and knowing that I need to do other things, that I have to leave.
- I'm probably an actor that tends to, instead of putting things on, think about it more in terms of taking away what's not in the character, until I'm left with what is. If that makes sense. That's probably a particularly American way of working, but maybe not. The end of any movie is a readjustment.
- As an actor, you usually live your life with faith.
- Bad directors will tell you they absolutely know how to do it, and how it has to happen; there's this insecurity that leads them to feeling like they have to control everything.
