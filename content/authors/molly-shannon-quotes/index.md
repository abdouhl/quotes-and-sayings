- I guess I have a positive attitude about divorce because I have some friends who've gotten divorced, and I'm like, 'Well, if it's better, then - good!'
- Without a doubt, the worst part of being a mom is having to floss my kids' teeth every night. It's so tedious.
- If you can write and create original characters, do your own show, develop your own material, it gives you more power than just waiting around to be hired.

- I lead a very normal life. I'm just so happy being a mother that everything else revolves around that. If a movie falls through or a TV show doesn't get picked up, I'm pretty easygoing about it because I'm just like, 'Yay, I get to be with my kids more!'

- I used to watch 'SNL' when I was babysitting, after I put the kids to bed. It was the Gilda Radner and Bill Murray era. I loved it.

- The love of a parent, that connection, it's eternal.
- I went to drama school at New York University.
