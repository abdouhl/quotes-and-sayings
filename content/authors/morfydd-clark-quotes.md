- I think my mum is courageous.
- I think the biggest lesson I have learned is not to get too anxious about your work.
- I want men to be asking to play great female parts!
- I think, in the past, you could buy a flat and live comfortably on theatre and touring theatre, but you can't do that anymore, which means that you have to have a certain amount of celebrity and profile to, therefore, get TV and film work.
- The theatre world is so starved of funds, and that's unfortunately reflected in the pay.
- Apparently, when I was really little, I watched the film version of 'The Secret Garden' and thought it was, like, the best thing ever.
- I had always seen myself doing theatre, as I don't come from an acting background, so that was my first way into acting, I suppose.
- I actually came out of drama school and went into two years of working in film and television, which was a happy accident.
- I think you have lots of actors who would much rather do a wonderful part at the Royal Shakespeare Company, but then you have to take a two-line part in a TV thing to pay the bills.
- I was always far more into anything creative that called for a bit of active participation, like reading aloud in class. Then, having left school shortly after my GCSEs, I auditioned for the National Youth Theatre of Wales and the National Youth Theatre of Great Britain as well as the Welsh National Youth Opera. I ended up getting into all three.
- I'm good at forgetting auditions, and then there is a surprise to getting something.
- For some reason, the only Swedish I know how to say is, 'There is no toilet paper.'
- I wish Wales was more represented on the British stage, and I have missed that being in London.
- When on stage, I have good concentration. When I don't find something interesting, I can't concentrate.
- My dyslexia means I can't read for long periods or the letters start moving around on the page, giving me headaches.
- I've done two Shakespeare tragedies, so I'd desperately like to do comedy. It would be nice not to die.
- I wasn't great in class and suffered from dyslexia and ADHD; still do. As a result I could never sit in class listening quietly, and my attention would inevitably end up wandering after a short while.
- My family was always really encouraging, but acting was always something I thought was a bit of a pipe dream.
