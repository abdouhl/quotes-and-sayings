- To be successful in coaching you have to treat your team like a family. The leader needs backing from everyone.
- It's often been said that you learn more from losing than you do from winning. I think, if you're wise, you learn from both. You learn a lot from a loss. You learn what is it that we're not doing to get to where we want to go. It really gets your attention and it really motivates the work ethic of your team when you're not doing well.
- True basketball coaches are great teachers and you do not humiliate, you do not physically go after, you do not push or shove, you do not berate, if you are a true coach. If you humiliate or curse them, that won't do it. Coaches like that are not coaches.
- Players would empty their souls to me; you cannot fathom the stories I've heard, everything from the good to the bad. I tried whatever I could to work things out.
- The big thing is to make a winning effort. I'm not obsessed with wins.
- You learn more from losing than winning. You learn how to keep going.
- If I can pay the bills, I'm happy.
- It's amazing the things you hear from your players talking to them one on one. I never embarrassed a player, I spoke with him alone.
- I'm glad the NCAA is pushing back the 3-point line a foot. I'm a big supporter of the 3-point shot; it's exciting. I hope the high schools adopt the same rule.
- That's the beauty of coaching. You get to touch lives, you get to make a difference. You get to do things for people who will never pay you back and they say you never have had a perfect day until you've done something for someone who will never pay you back.
- I fell in love with coaching. I loved interacting with young people, having the opportunity to make a tremendous impression on them.
