- Like timidity, bravery is also contagious.

- A household can never appear prosperous without a cow. How auspicious it is to wake up in the morning to the mooing of your own cow!
- If there were a being in the world whose eyes could look into other people's hearts, very few men or women would be able to face up to it.
- We all have to die some day. Not very many immortals have shown up in this world.
- Trees bear fruits only to be eaten by others; the fields grown grains, but they are consumed by the world. Cows give milk, but she doesn't drink it herself - that is left to others. Clouds send rain only to quench the parched earth. In such giving, there is little space for selfishness.

- Boys are quite often whimsical. Whereas girls are modest by nature and know their responsibilities very well. Their weapons are service, sacrifice, and love, by which they conquer over the males.
- I will not call that person happy who knows no rest because of his enemies, who is the butt of fun by all and for whom no one has any empathy, who is as if held on a leash by others, who has lost himself in hedonistic pursuits, who preys on those weaker to him and wags his tail for his superiors.
- Parents are one's companions in life but not partakers of one's karma.
- People are so selfish. Those you help are the ones who turn against you.

- If someone ensures us two square meals a day, we will sing and pray all our waking hours. If one has to hoe sugarcane all day, devotion to God vanishes like smoke.
- Wealth and compassion are opposites.
