- I'm a real nature lover, so whenever possible, I like to get to the beach or get to a forest or get somewhere there's fresh air. Apart from that, I'm a film addict and a DVD freak.
- I'm addicted to travel.
- I love New York, and I love being here, but I think I'll always be Australian at heart.
- When we were working on 'Looking' in San Francisco, I bought a new bike from Mission Bicycle Company, which I'm completely in love with.
- I can be a little obsessive about avoiding colds and flu. Thera Zinc Echinacea lozenges are awesome, and I almost always have some with me.
- No person and no character is beyond redemption, ultimately. That's the great thing about playing a character that has kind of a dark side; there's room to explore the opposite.
- Speaking personally, I didn't think 40 would be a big issue, and I don't think I have issues about age, but there are naturally some big questions that come up at that point in your life.
- I always wanted to live outside of Australia... because I think it's good to see the world and get out of where you've been living, particularly if you're from somewhere like Australia, which is so isolated from the rest of the world. I chose New York because there was such a great choice of acting classes and it's such an intense place.
- I've never been a big nightlife person. I have a pretty low-key life.
