- Personally, I don't trust people who go out of their way to state they never read or watch horror and insist there's something wrong with those of us who do.
- I cannot sing Vampirella artist Patrick Berkenkotter's praises loudly or often enough.
- I became a horror fan during the early 1960s, back when Hammer was putting out their groundbreaking 'Dracula' series with Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing, and grew up watching 'Dark Shadows.'
- I've been writing in some way, shape, or form for as long as I can remember.
- The vampires in the 'VAMPS' series judge each other as harshly as they judge humans, and basically, vampires don't get along very well. So you've got a culture that's from cradle to grave like the worst high school you've ever been in.
- I know about various fictional and folkloric vampire mythoses the way other people know about the personal life of celebrities.
- I'm very excited about taking over the reins on Vampirella. I've really been enjoying myself so far.
- Back when I was growing up, getting caught with a copy of 'Creepy,' 'Eerie' or 'Vampirella' was almost as bad as your parents finding out you were reading 'Playboy.'
- If you could stay at this stage - you're 17, and you're always going to be in love with your first love - that's probably attractive.
- Horror serves a cathartic role in human society, all throughout the world. It is a way of confronting the darkness, both within and without.
- One of the things that may appeal to teenagers is that vampires never change - they're frozen in that age.
- The best advice I got as a writer was also the first advice, which came from the late fantasy author and editor Karl Edward Wagner: Any agent who charges to look at your work is a crook.
- Vampires are handy characters, as they can do double duty as monster/villains and the classic, misunderstood romantic hero.
