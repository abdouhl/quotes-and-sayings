- Runners exalt the marathon as a public test of private will, when months or years of solitary training, early mornings, lost weekends, rain and pain mature into triumph or surrender. That's one reason the race-day crowds matter, the friends who come to cheer and stomp and flap their signs and push the runners on.
- America's presidents tend to die young. Maybe it is in the nature of the men who reach such heights, or of the job once they attain it.
