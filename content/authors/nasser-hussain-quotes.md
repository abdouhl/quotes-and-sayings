- I haven't stuck my head out to be captain of England.
- Batsmen like Gary Kirsten, Boeta Dippenaar and Neil McKenzie have good techniques and can bat for long periods.

- You should not be flat playing for your country.
- Being in charge of a team is just like having kids.

- Many Pakistani fans will say they have followed their team for too long and had their hearts broken many times, but I love them, and I love their cricket.

- You are only given so much talent and it is up to you what you do with it.

- From the age of eight until 15 or 16, every time I was out bowling leg spin I was thinking about my dad and when you've done that it stays with you. There are lots of things he did which enabled me to be the player that I was. It wasn't me that wanted to be a cricketer. He made me 90 per cent of the player I was and the person I was.

- Patriotism is something I wear in my heart not on my head.
- Pressure is the biggest single factor in Test cricket.
