- I had never seen the classics with Molly Ringwald, like 'Pretty in Pink' or 'Sixteen Candles,' or '80s horror, like 'Poltergeist,' 'Close Encounters,' and 'Nightmare on Elm Street.' I went back and watched all of those.
- I do see a lot of roles that are, like, the girlfriend or the love interest or the girl next door. Maybe not totally well-rounded kinds of characters - women who are more of a plot device in a way.
- I'm really drawn to relationship stories and human emotions.
- My mom loves the '80s. I grew up hearing a lot about the '80s.
- I don't really like scary movies. I don't seek them out. I'm very sensitive and impressionable. I'm the kind of person who will sleep with the light on for a week if I get really scared.
- Social media - It's not real life. I only caught the tail end of it in high school. It can be good, and it can be fun, but you can't let it get toxic.
- I was always kind of searching for the right social group in high school and never really felt like I belonged with any one specific clique.
- Good luck dragging me into a horror movie! I get so scared. It's an overactive imagination or something.
- I do have Instagram, but I try to avoid going on it too much. Some people are very good at how they use it, and they enjoy that interaction, but I want to be very careful.
- There's a lot to love about Nancy Wheeler in the second season of 'Stranger Things.'
- Sometimes I wake up and look in the mirror and am like, 'Whoa!' I don't know if I'm having more fun, but I'm having a lot of fun.
- People do recognize me. I walk around with sunglasses, and I think I'm hidden, but they see me.
- I think people are going to places that they weren't able to with television before, and I think Netflix really paved the way for that. With freedom comes better content, and with better content comes great actors and a bigger audience. I think that has just snowballed into a movement for making really great TV.
- When people approach me, it's a vulnerable moment for everybody. You can see that sometimes people don't quite know what to say to you, but they want to come up to you, and you can tell they're nervous, and it's really humbling and endearing.
- I'm not a momentary decision maker. I like well-informed decisions.
- When you go to set, they just go, 'OK, let's see what you guys do!' The camera moves around what you initially feel.
- To go from not being recognised at all to literally, the next day, having people stop you in the street was very, very weird. I had to buy myself a great baseball cap.
- When you're in high school, and you're trying to get the attention of a guy you like, sometimes you don't always make the best decisions.
- The hardest thing is not caring about other people's opinions.
