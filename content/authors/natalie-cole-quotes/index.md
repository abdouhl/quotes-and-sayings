- I know that God has had my back, even when I was screwing up.

- We used to have to arrange things around the dialysis. I would have to plan where to play so I could be back in time, and couldn't go too far.

- I started saying, 'I don't want to be crazy anymore.' I need to make some changes.

You know, trying to define yourself through other people or men, in particular.

- I think that it's going to be interesting to see where Beyonce's career goes.

- One of these days, I'd like to put together a revue of all my music, which would probably turn into a marathon. There's a couple of hit songs from almost every phase of my career. At the same time, visually, if you don't handle it properly, it could be a cacophony of craziness, because there's just so many different kinds of music.
- I can laugh at myself because I've had to. Everything would have been much worse if I'd been the singing son of Nat 'King' Cole.
- We are born with two kidneys and only need one to survive. Maybe God gave us the other one so that we could give it away.

- If you don't shop smart, you get a little trendy.
- One thing that stays the same is my passion for music. Other than that, I've become more dedicated. I think that I really work much harder than I ever did when I first started at my craft; I'm more dedicated, and I have become a perfectionist.

- Aretha Franklin does not like me.
- I have been on dialysis in Istanbul, Milan, Indonesia, Manila, London. It's - it's amazing.
- Like my father, I don't want to see anyone mistreated, anything like that. I'm very racial-conscious because my father had a lot of, you know, challenges in the area of race. I'm very sensitive to that kind of issue.
- As miserable as I was, once I started singing, I felt better.
- I don't think anyone can measure up to what my father had achieved. I'm just happy to at least play some of his music, but he is really the one who was the pioneer, the one who started all this. He's really The King.
- Physically, I've seen a change in my life. No, I haven't had a face lift or anything like that. I've grown. That's God's countenance.
- My father was a pioneer in so many ways. He was fearless, and I think that I kind of picked that up from him as well.
- I would never do an album with 10 songs like 'Jump Start' on it. I'll only go so far to please fans.

- Life is such a gift, I just say thank you all day.
- I have been to hell and back. I have seen the edge. I have seen the dark side of life.

- I was pretty young, but because of that first record, 'Cole Espanol,' we took our first trip - well, my first trip - to Mexico.

- There are a lot of great artists with great voices who aren't singing what they should be singing.

- It's remarkable what a new kidney does to your life. I have no complaints... I'm pretty amazed. I have been working on my stamina.
- I never got to make that transition from little girl to young woman... and that really screws you up.
- I've had my share of doing things that I really wish I hadn't done.
- The medication I had to take was a form of chemotherapy. You feel like death every day. No appetite. No energy. But the treatment worked. It cured my liver 80 per cent but compromised my kidneys.
- When I sang my father's songs in concert, that was all people wanted to hear. I was always asking myself, 'Can I measure up?'
- I felt that if I'm serious about acting, I would like people to see me as an actress. It's less of a stretch if I'm singing, unless I'm playing a character who sings.
- People said when I started, 'Why don't you just copy your father's style?' I had to be myself, singing my songs in my own way.
- I'm just really, really thankful. I'm thankful to the doctors; I'm thankful to the family that donated the kidney.
- We had some wonderful people raising us, but they still weren't our parents. As you get older, it gets distorted and convoluted, complicated, and, of course, you start looking for attention, affection, affinity in all the wrong places and in all the wrong ways.
- I continually acted up to get attention. My father gave me that, and once he left, I felt that I didn't have any.
- If you don't have dialysis, absolutely, you will die. Dialysis is actually keeping me alive.
