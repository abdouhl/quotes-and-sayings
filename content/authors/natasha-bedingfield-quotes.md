- The common denominator is a love of music.
- I like doing very high action things. Running, boxing, a lot of free weights. They're not heavy. I eat what I want, really, because I think that while you're working out you can eat better.
- I wanted to write about relationships. But I didn't feel I had the experience to sing about them in a deep way. Studying psychology helped me out in terms of my understanding. I still look through my old textbooks when I'm in need of inspiration.
- I love lamb shank. It's my favorite thing. You don't have it in America. It's a younger meat - it just falls off the bone - it's kind of like a roast. I really like blackened cod too.
- My family comes from New Zealand, but I'm a London girl. I was born and raised in London, but I've got the blood of a New Zealander, so I always kind of felt like I didn't belong - in a good way.
- I don't want to be the next anyone. I just want to be me, now. And that means all different things.
- I get very deep into the writing and recording process.
- Write your own songs. It helps you to mean what you're singing, which will then make it mean something to listeners.
- People don't listen to one radio station. On iTunes you can mix different worlds and bring country and pop and folk and live music together with a mass audience. I could have sung 'Easy' in a country way but I just sang it how I sing. I think it's a really nice blend.
- A lot of my songs are about taking whatever life throws at you and making the most of it.
- I got a job as soon as I could - 11 or 12. I started babysitting and then I got a part-time job at a pharmacy in England. I just remember loving the feeling of going out and buying my own clothes! I'd go bargain-hunting and get secondhand vintage stuff.
- I'm very honest in my music and I'm often asked to explain the lyrics; as an introvert, I find that quite hard. And I always wear high heels on stage, which can be painful.
- I'm the diva from the future. The next gig's on the moon. Catch me while you can.
- The music technology scene is changing so fast it's hard to keep up.
- I took temp jobs, recorded a demo in the evenings and eventually shopped a record deal. All I knew was that I wanted to write songs; thankfully, I also got to sing them.
- Music is a very powerful thing. If I'm angry, I can write a song about it, and it seems to make everything okay.
- I know I should keep this a secret, but Celine Dion is something of an icon to me.
- I did actually like school. When I was 17, I was in college, but before that, I was home-schooled. I was very social. I liked to know everyone.
- I liked English and art and did a lot of painting. And for some reason I was good at math, but I wasn't an A student. I really had to work hard to get good grades.
- I love arranging my music, not in alphabetical order but by mood, creating playlists for when I have energy and want to work out or go-out party mixes and music to chill out to.
- As a teenager I had friends who had little music studios in their bedrooms and garages. I'd go and play around; very soon, my hobby became a passion.
- I would love to do something with Coldplay.
