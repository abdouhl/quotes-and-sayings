- I've been very fortunate.
- It's funny landing parts now where I'm somebody's mum. I remember the first time I was asked to play a mum. I was easily old enough, but because I didn't have any children, I thought, 'That seems really grown-up.'
- I'm guilty of it myself, sort of thinking, 'Classic novels: snoozeville.' But there is a huge amount of wonderful material.
- By the time I was 10, I had lived in 11 different countries.
- It might be quite boring if you did something and thought it was perfect.
- 'Pride And Prejudice' takes place in a similar period to 'Vanity Fair,' and yet there's a huge difference between Jane Austen and Thackeray.
- I've enjoyed all the work I've done, and I feel quite lucky that I haven't been playing sweet girls all the time.
- As an actor, I'm in such a privileged position because my work is job by job. If something doesn't fit in with family life, there's more flexibility.
- I wouldn't feel comfortable talking to someone I didn't know very well and, beyond that person, a readership of X millions, about things I think are private.
- Period drama is such a huge umbrella term: it seems to cover everything from Claudius to something from the 1920s.
- I know it sounds ridiculous, but I haven't quite got over the miracle that you plant things, and they do sprout up.
- I know some people are really comfortable with talking about their feelings and hopes and fears in public, but I'm not, and I don't think it's that extraordinary.
- I've never, ever done a piece of work - and can't imagine doing a piece of work - when I've thought, 'I was pretty perfect in that.'
- Being an actor does make you aware of your age.
- I'm not cool at all. I'm the least cool person I know.
- Having my own family has made me realise there's more to life than chasing the next job.
- I love acting. It's what I do, not what I am.
- I was told it might be quite difficult to conceive, so it really was a great blessing when my pregnancy suddenly happened. I had been diagnosed years ago with polycystic ovarian syndrome, which can affect your fertility - but luckily, in my case, it didn't.
- I love rehearsing; it's the best part of the job.
- Getting older doesn't bother me. When I was 30, I thought I should have achieved more, but you get more comfortable and think it's time to stop putting pressure on yourself.
- My family weren't actors, and we didn't know any actors. It wasn't even something I was aware you could do as a job. I thought you had to be a Redgrave or a Barrymore before you were allowed to go to drama school.
- I really like working, the opportunity to work with good people and to play interesting parts.
- You can finish the day's filming or the whole shoot or watch something months later and think you could have done it so much better. It's frustrating.
- Acting was a slow-burn thing. I found it was something I really, really liked doing, but it wasn't until my third year at drama school that I actually thought, 'Oh, right, I'm trained for this now; I'd better see if I can do it.'
- I have this sense of humour which is about as sophisticated as a seven-year-old schoolboy. I get very overexcited and silly.
- I love my work, and I feel fortunate to be doing a job I love, but it isn't the centre of my life.
