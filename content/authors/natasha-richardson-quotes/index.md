- I knew that for this movie to work it had to be very hot and very real, and it wasn't going to be a case of doing it Hollywood all covered with a nice little sheet.
- What's in the movie compared to what we shot is the tip of the iceberg.
- I wake up every morning feeling lucky - which is driven by fear, no doubt, since I know it could all go away.
- Part of the reason for moving to New York was the sense that it just didn't matter how much work I did in England, I continued to be seen simply as a Redgrave. I did feel I could be who I am in New York and we all like to feel appreciated.
- I was definitely incredibly close to my dad, in a way that was all-encompassing. I am close to my mum, too, but there were areas that she and I did not share. So his loss to me was huge, personally and professionally. He believed in me, not just as a father, but as a director, and that always meant a lot.
- The degree that these scenes went to... there was a couple of days I was upset... I'd have to hurry back to the girls in the makeup trailer and have a bit of a cry because it messes with your head.
- I know the pressures of being the daughter of a great actress. But it's inspiring. You learn so much that other people don't get to learn until later on. My father being a director, I learnt a real work ethic.
- As I grew up in that world and saw how much it affected her world and how much it affected our childhood, it made me very aware of politics. Of course, I have my own private feelings and thoughts, but I don't care to share them.
- A film is a director's vision... there is, however, much input an actor or actress can have.
- I'm not the kind of actress that goes home with the character. I mean, you're thinking about the work or the next day's scenes, but not staying in character. But as a film goes on, you become more and more fragile, emotionally. And physically too, actually.
- What my father especially taught me was to not always take the safe road, the easy road. If you are going to do good work, you have to risk failing badly.
- I've played comedy before but not that much. I mostly do get drawn to darker material.
- I always felt too young and selfish to have children of my own.
