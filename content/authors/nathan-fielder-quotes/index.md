- I just don't have this magnetic personality that everyone is drawn to. I don't make friends easily... I'm just not one of those people.
- In life, a lot of great ideas sound insane or absurd at first.
- Once in a while, I do these things that would make the 10-year old version of me laugh. I don't know why. You've got to do something a little bit immature. I'm surprised at how often those are my best ideas.
- Dramas make me laugh. The other day, I saw 'The Place Beyond the Pines,' and I was giggling the whole time. I laugh when I'm uncomfortable.
- It's much funnier when the comedy can happen with me just trying my best to genuinely do a good thing.
- Social interactions have always been a bit of a difficult thing for me. I think I have a natural tendency to make people not 100 percent super comfortable.
- I loved theatre and did magic, too, but I was never the best at it - there was never a teacher saying, 'You're great, you have to make this your career!' I was good at science and math. I figured I'd go into science and become a dentist.
- I don't like getting people upset, so that's not my goal. But I like putting people in situations where how they respond says a lot about them.
- I'm not into things that feel like a sequel. There's just something magical about when something happens for the first time.
- I'm very bad at ending sentences. A lot times I just want to say, 'That's the end of my sentence. I have nothing more to say.'
- I used to trade stocks online, and I kind of felt gross, like, all I'm doing is making money off other people's creativity, and I'm not creating anything myself.
- A lot of the time, people think I'm really dumb or really uncomfortable talking to them, which is kind of a real thing.
- I have a business background. I have always wanted to open my own business.
- It's weird. I don't really have goals. I just try to make sure I'm enjoying what I'm doing. Once I start to get sick of it, the next thing becomes obvious.
- The type of thing that one person would get mad at, another person would laugh at, is a good kind of zone to be in.
- I auditioned for 'The Office,' and I don't know if it was a role I could do, but I liked the character. You do one take, and you're reading with a person who's just sitting in a chair and not really... you're not playing off someone, which is what I like to do. I like to play around and find the moment.
- I seem to get into situations that make people laugh, but I don't consider myself that funny of a person. I'm not witty. I'm kind of slow in conversations. I'm not that articulate with jokes. The first time I made stuff and screened it for an audience, I was surprised what people were laughing at.
- If I find something funny and make an older woman laugh, I love that for some reason.
