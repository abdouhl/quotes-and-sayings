- The older I get, the more I'm prepared to do things for the money.
- A slice of hot, buttered toast is the perfect meal. It's not too much and not too little, and it gives you just the right buzz.
- I think that reality TV is so bad. It is a tool by the media to not make people think.
- Only when I came to America did I think of myself as British.
- It is not easy to get parts in mainstream films for most people of color. Hollywood and British writers are not writing parts for us, or the directors are not interested in casting us in parts that are color-blind.
- I saw the pilot, you know, because you have to have some knowledge of the piece that you are in, but I never saw an episode of 'Lost.'
- I never felt at home in London, because people were constantly telling me I didn't belong here, so after a while, you tend to believe that.
- The unknown is always frightening.
- I think you can achieve things in television that you can't achieve on film, and I think we managed to do a lot of that in the first season of 'Lost.'
- Just because I never went to university doesn't mean you can't read, although I do feel a bit uneducated from time to time.
- I think any actor should be aware of where they're starting to stretch into what's not truthful.
- Men are the weaker sex and retain their immaturity, it seems, to the grave. It's like a built-in design fault. You can't do anything about it.
- If a character's suddenly spouting information that's supposed to bring you up to date, it can seem artificial or contrived.
- Let's just say I was really bad. Now I have grown into myself. I have changed.
- I couldn't bloody believe a prime-time TV show would have an Iraqi ex-Republican Guard torturer as a main character.
- They were both academics, but my dad had to get a job on the railway, and my mum had to get a job in the Post Office. It was pretty hard in terms of the racism they had to endure.
- Personally, I think it would have been really nice, if 'Lost' had just one season.
- My parents moved to England with that immigrant ethos of self-betterment, but I don't think they expected the kind of grief they experienced.
- The great lesson I got from my parents is how not to treat your children. To break that chain, even if I don't do anything else, at least I've done that.
- Older women know who they are, and that makes them more beautiful than younger ones. I like to see a face with some character. I want to see lines. I want to see wrinkles.
- You can do things with TV that you just can't do on film. There's so much more time: there's the opportunity for development, and you can let things lay dormant for a period. You can't really do that in two hours or three hours in a movie that often, I would say.
- Whenever I go back to London, I have this horrible feeling that something bad will happen, and I won't be able to get back to America. It's a nightmare feeling.
- I can't emphasise enough how grateful I am to have come upon sobriety.
- I have absolutely no interest in the tabloids or reporting of the royal family.
- When the world says, 'Jump,' you gotta jump. It's like me moving to America when I was 29. I just did it. And now it's a home. You can't plan those things.
- I'm not an academic, but I've always loved poetry since I've been small.
- I've always liked women who are older. They seem to know who they are, and they've lived. They've got soul, and that's very attractive.
- I still have a great friendship with my eldest son's mum. She's my mate. We have this wonderful son who's 6 ft. 3, gorgeous, and I'm his dad. I've not been a total failure.
- We seem to be the victims of religious dogma, both from the Christian Right here and, of course, in the East with the rise of Islamic fundamentalism.
- If you don't take the chance to live life, what can you say at the end of it?
- If you've grown up feeling unattractive, I don't think you ever lose that. It never goes.
- I was always in trouble from an early age. I had a fraught relationship with my parents, who were very traditional. Doing plays at school was a joyous release.
- In England, the class system is about a thousand years old, and it's not going to change any time soon.
- It's always been very important to me to try to do projects which are breaking new ground.
- My mum made a conscious decision not to teach me any Indian languages so I wouldn't talk with an accent.
- Any human being is this wonderful conglomeration of experiences and behaviors, if you like - some of them healthy, some of them not so healthy.
- I think I may have failed at a lot of things, but the one thing I can say, and that I'm proud of, is that I am a good parent.
- I'm never going to wake up and look in the mirror and think, 'Yes, I'll go out and meet people.' Most of the time, you wake up, look in the mirror, and want to give up. And that doesn't change. It isn't awful; it's just the way I feel.
- Los Angeles is the only place that I can honestly say I have ever called home.

- That's what we have with the Old Testament and the New Testament: good storytelling.
- I can't change a light bulb.
- With 'Lost,' some members of the cast would literally open the script and find out that they were dead. I mean, that's quite sad, really.
