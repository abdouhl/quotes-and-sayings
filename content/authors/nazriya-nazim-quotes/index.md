- I never thought I'd get married to someone from the film industry. I still remember telling my parents that I want to get married somewhere abroad and live there, away from everything.
- I got married because I knew it's going to be the same with us. I've never been told what to do by Fahadh. That because you are married to me, this is how you should be. Nothing has changed career wise or in my personal life.
- To become an actress was not something I had planned, it just came about through a music video. I just went with that flow.
- When I listen to a script I don't think too deeply, my thought is 'will it excite me to do this?' I don't overthink.
- I plan to produce more films if I come across interesting stories.
- But, for me, the character lives between action and cut.
- Fahadh has left it to me to decide whether I want to continue acting after our marriage. Our parents were the ones who suggested this match. They wanted us to decide whether or not to proceed. We started talking and fell in love.
- People just assume that you are not going to act after marriage, will stop doing romantic roles, and that every guy will stop his wife from acting. People who choose that are absolutely fine. I won't be shocked if I myself do it later. But that wasn't the case with us.
- Production has a lot if risks but I think acting is more challenging. You have to make a character look real.
- Although I have not done too many films as a child artiste, the advantage is that you are familiar with the world of movies and it is easier to face the camera.
- I think 'Neram' gave me the right break. At that time, I felt that the film was experimental and risky, but the film's success made people take note of me.
- I've never been told what to do by Fahadh. That because you are married to me, this is how you should be. Nothing has changed career wise or in my personal life.
