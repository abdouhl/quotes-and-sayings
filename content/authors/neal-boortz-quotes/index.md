- Free speech is meant to protect unpopular speech. Popular speech, by definition, needs no protection.
- Many unions have contracts with employers that are based on a multiple of the prevailing minimum wage. If the minimum wage goes up, union salaries go up by a similar percentage.

- I don't believe in atheists.
- I saw podcast sites with all these fancy graphics. People don't care about that. They sign up for what I do.

- I still think what the consumers are looking for is, number one, entertainment. They want to be entertained. It can be a liberal, a libertarian, or a conservative. It can be far-left or far-right. If they are entertained, they are going to tune in.
- Religion is all-too-often a refuge for scoundrels.
- I was your quintessential nerd in high school.
- The principal purpose of the Democratic Party is to use the force of government to take property away from the people who earn it and give it to people who do not.
- Freedom isn't for wimps.

- If you support the war on drugs in its present form, then you're only paying lip-service to the defense of freedom, and you don't really grasp the concept of the sovereign individual human being.
- The Tea Partiers don't want all regulations eliminated. They just want laws that can be understood and regulations that aren't going to destroy businesses, or leave deserving veterans without a source for a mortgage loan.
- A lot of people out there pay good lip service to the idea of personal freedom... right up to the point that someone tries to do something that they don't personally approve of.
- There is nothing quite so depressing as waking up to face a day when you know that you are going to have to deal with a government office or bureaucrat.
- The key to accepting responsibility for your life is to accept the fact that your choices, every one of them, are leading you inexorably to either success or failure, however you define those terms.
