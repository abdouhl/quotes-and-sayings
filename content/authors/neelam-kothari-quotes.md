- Samir's very understanding and my parents think he's a great guy.
- People remember my work so fondly.
- Trends keep changing but the more classic designs never go out of style.
- When you are putting yourself out there - be it a web series, movie or a reality show - you have to prepare for the good and the bad.
- Since not everyone is looking for something elaborate, I've come up with a range of simple things that everyone can buy and wear.
- I ate everything and I never exercised or even went for a walk. I guess I had a great metabolic rate.
- I have always been fascinated with precious stones, especially colored ones, and knew that I would eventually join the family business and be a jewelry designer some day.
- I felt blessed and very grateful to God that I didn't have to struggle and things were easy for me.
- The young talent we have in dancing in our country is to be seen to be believed.
- I've come up with a bridal collection, and for Diwali, I've done really nice kadhas, long danglers, and fun-affordable daily wear pieces.
- Thanks to 'Super Dancer - Chapter 4,' that I was reminded how popular was our jodi, and the love for our songs. It was exhilarating to experience the fandom in person and to remember all those old songs. It was a great feeling.
- I want to get something done but I am scared. I said I want to get a filler done. Very little, obviously.
- I wore baggy clothes with a broad belt in strange colour combinations like yellow and purple! I wasn't brand conscious.
- I have no problem saying I am 50.
- Definitely if I got an opportunity to judge again I would love to.
- Everyone is going through this ageing process. Whether in their minds or they are discussing it with their friends, they all want to look good and they don't know what to do.
- I got to be comfortable and it has to interest me.
- At the time when I was at the peak of my career in Bollywood, we never had social media to give us a direct sense of our popularity, the excitement among fans and their appreciation.
- My workmanship and quality are my strengths.
- Adoption has been on our minds for quite a while. The procedure took a couple of months. We wanted a baby, who is around six to seven months old.
- Be it judging or be it acting, yeah if something interesting comes my way even if it's judging for another show, I'll be open to it.
- Competition is great; it keeps you going.
- But I must tell you that dancing to 'Aapke Aa Jaane Se' from 'Khudgarz' was phenomenal.
- Govinda's style of dancing is very energetic and filmi, while mine is soft and light movements.
- I rarely go to film parties.
- I didn't realize that so many people watch 'Bigg Boss' and are actually supporting Samir.
- I look back and thank God for my parents who were supportive.
- I have been inundated with the most encouraging response on social media, and it almost feels like I've made a comeback! I have to say that this adulation and warmth really tempts and motivates me to be more active in the industry going forward.
- Samir is a well composed person. Dolly Bindra tried his patience big time.
- I have experimented with semi-precious stones because it's more fun and affordable too. Then, I have the colourful rubies, Columbian emeralds and a mix of everything.
- A lot of people say I am different from other actors and actresses because I don't mix around with a lot of filmy crowd.
- I keep to myself.
- One day I was in the movie world with its glamour and then when I looked at it realistically and realised my shelf life was over, I was out of it all, setting up office somewhere.

- When I go out to parties and I see some of our friends, who are 50-plus and they look great, I always wonder what she does, which doctor she goes to.
- I feel girls are best for their parents.
- I was extremely excited when I got to know that Govinda was going to be with me on 'Super Dancer - Chapter 4.' It was definitely a kind of reunion, and I was really happy about sharing screen space with him after over 30 years.
- I had no clue the songs from my films almost three decades ago are still popular.
- Govinda and I met after a very long time. We did many films together but I really didn't know that we were so popular as a jodi. We haven't kept in touch per se, but sometimes bumped into each other at a party or two. We don't have common friends, we have no commonalities.
- The men who are available are just not worth it.
- My family has been in the business of manufacturing exclusive handcrafted jewelry for many years.
- My jewelry is inspired by period pieces but has a contemporary look.
- I was very clear that I'd join my family business and become a jewellery designer.
- I've been such a private person.
- Samir respects me for what I am. I think we get along because we're similar in a way. He's quiet and likes his own space like I do.
- All I want is somebody who can keep me happy. I don't think that's too much to ask, is it?
- Oh, I love my Calcutta clients! They understand good-quality stones and they want good-quality jewelry, be it colored stones or diamonds or good workmanship.
- The times of COVID are extremely risky.
- We waited a long time to get married. He came with his baggage. I had mine. While we sorted our issues we got a chance to know one another better.
- My inspiration is always nature.
