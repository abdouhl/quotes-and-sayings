- My aim is to do better than I did in Tokyo. I am glad I won the Olympic gold. I may have got the national record, but I am trying to breach the 90-metre barrier.
- I try to keep things as simple as possible: my job as a javelin thrower is to stay in good shape and do my best at each competition.
- Javelin is a very technical sport. I rectified my faults over time. Then I trained under foreign coaches who further rectified my errors.
- I am very fond of sports apparel so I used to visit the mall often and get some good shirts or shoes and even have a nice meal with my physiotherapist.
- The Olympics is by far the biggest stage of them all for any sportsperson, so I'm looking forward to it.
- We are farmers, nobody in the family has a government job and my family has been supporting me with difficulty. But it is a sort of relief now that I am able to support my family financially besides continuing with my training.
- I love blasting good music on the Bluetooth speakers through my phone.
- Punjabi songs and Babu Mann tops my playlist. I also listen to a lot of English music although I don't understand a single word. If the music is good, I am fine.
- My life became occupied with only a couple of things: go to the stadium and practice, come back home, eat, then go back to training.
- It motivates me that people rate me so highly and want me to do well, which is a good feeling. Personally, I don't think about milestones or medals, but like to take each competition as it comes and focus on doing my best and becoming better with each competition.
- A medal in Tokyo Olympics is my target, it's the ultimate for an athlete. I am still young and my best is yet to come.
- We athletes have a life that revolves around training.
- My technique is such that even if I turn my back on the throw, I understand what I have thrown and I start celebrating.
- The biggest learning is that an athlete needs to know when to stop. To know that if I push beyond this, there could be a problem.
- Javelin throw is a very technical event and a lot depends on the day's form.
- Medals are decided on the day, not before that.
- Sports teaches us to be together and united.
- Once I throw, I immediately know how well I have done, or how badly, from the effort I have put in and the way the rhythm and technique comes together.
- I did have a very good 2018 season, but missed out on the entire 2019 season because of the surgery I had to undergo on my elbow and the rehabilitation after that.
