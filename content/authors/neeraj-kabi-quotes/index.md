- Well, to tell you honestly, I am still waiting for much better roles. And I am slightly surprised that despite seeing the quality and hard work, the Hindi film industry is still not creating projects that I can be a part of.
- I do not like to label the characters I am doing or even myself as a particular type of actor. I try to do different kind of roles which are not the same 'hero' or 'villain' kind.
- There are many actors who have not been trained, but self-taught means one cannot be limited. It means you're continuously learning.
- I'm not a method actor. The techniques that I follow have been created and practiced in my own journey, ones that I have researched, formed and invented.
- Relationships have become like pizza and coke, which might look fancy but has nothing good to offer.
- If the way I've performed a scene isn't to the director's liking, I discuss it, try to understand why he doesn't like it, and incorporate the suggestions. But sometimes I also take a very strong stand.
- Every choice I'm making now is so that I can keep working for the next 30-40 years in this industry. These are not creative choices. These choices are to stay in the business, for many years to come.
- For me, theatre and cinema are both pillars of an actor's life; I'd feel very half-baked if I was only doing one and not the other.
- Yes, I play a cop in Amit Kumar's 'Monsoon Shootout' where Nawazuddin Siddiqui plays the villain.
- I do work on stage as an actor. I do films as well. Television, I haven't done much.
- I don't discuss my journey in the Hindi film industry since it is something personal to me.
- You have to train yourself, think, contemplate, and work on your craft every day.
- I only like playing people who are completely different from me. I try to mould myself into that character.
- But I'm very keen to work with directors such as Imtiaz Ali, Zoya Akhtar, Farhan Akhtar, Vishal Bhardwaj, Abhishek Chaubey, Anurag Kashyap and Abhishek Kapoor.
- I put a lot of pressure on myself, I can't say today is a bad day, I can't do that to myself. Whatever it takes, I have to deliver a scene.
- My biggest inspiration has been life for me. Basic survival has been my biggest teacher. Surviving in Mumbai for so many years has been a huge ordeal.
- Adopting mannerisms is called mimicry. That is not a good way to do things. You don't start to imitate somebody, the way he walks and talks, that is a very irrelevant element of acting.
- The cast you are working with is important because it involves a give-and-take relationship. For me, when you have strong performers, multiple things happen, the magic of creation happens. That's where you build the craft.
- I remember watching 'The Lunchbox' that released around the same time 'Ship Of Theseus'. Both films found space in the independent cinema circuit. But at a personal level, 'The Lunchbox' is one of the favourite films.
- I like to enter my characters through a physical form first. The first thing I find is the regime of the character - when he wakes up tomorrow, what activities does this person engage in - that's my entry point. Once I get that, then it becomes easy for me.
- There's a lot of opportunity on the web that you couldn't imagine some years ago. People are experimenting at a fast rate.
- In most of our love stories the people are quite young in age. 'Once Again' is a love story about two mature people looking for companionship.
- The struggle is to sustain the quality. When I look at my work and the kind of responses I'm blessed with, I feel I need to do so much more.
- I don't know if I can call myself the poster boy. But yes, I am fortunate that a lot of work that I did was on the web. It has definitely got me some really good roles and a great audience.
- When you are a journalist, you have a big responsibility towards your audience and it is important to respect that responsibility.
- I was waiting for a good show on Amazon and 'Paatal Lok' had all of it - good script, story, and cast. It joined all the dots beautifully.
- I am not against doing commercial cinema at all.
- Money is very important to me, but its source is important too. As of now, I can say that I will never ever do films that demands me to sell my craft.
- I've done comedy on stage, in fact it is one of my strong points.
- When you watch me on the screen, you should not be able to recognise me. If people say, you're a natural and an organic actor, that's an insult. If you're being yourself all the time on screen, that means you don't know how to act.
- You have so many offers coming to you so as an actor it is all about finding which project to invest your energy in.
- Actually, I came to Mumbai from Jamshedpur in 1991 to become an actor. I began searching for work and I was all alone and absolutely empty-handed, no craft and nobody that I knew.
- I like to play Gandhi, but I've got tired of it, though not bored of it. I have to go through the physicality of losing weight.
- The whole process of acting is transformation. What is your power, quality and level of transformation, define you as an actor.
- I am confident that I am capable of leading projects, which are even complex.
- I never improvise. I create the character and transform into it.
- I have always stayed away from TV. It never made sense to me.
- To be honest, making films is so expensive and their shelf life is limited. On the web, content remains... you can watch it after five, eight, 10 years... There's a huge audience and content on the web is accessible at the click of a phone.
- I feel great when people like my work, but after a day or two, I don't keep that in my head. I go back to working and training. I don't rest on my laurels.
- In all these years of doing theatre, I've been a very physical performer - physically demonstrative, yet sticking to the realism of the piece.
- If I get a call from Imtiaz Ali or Zoya Akhtar to star in their films, I won't think twice.
- I've always looked towards mainstream. Many offers have come but they've been the wrong kind of offers. They are not the right business decisions for me to take.
- I like characters that are complex. I don't like people who are simple to play and are either black or white.
- Empathy is much bigger than sympathy. When the character is empathised with, that means you have succeeded as an actor. So even if it's a villain, the audiences don't hate you... they understand why you have turned into a villain.
- In 'Talvar', my character loses his daughter and it was quite an intense role. I had to concentrate and I would request all the unit members to stay silent before the take.
- I'm trying to do work that makes meaning and sense to me and the audience. But I have no qualms. I'm always willing to be a part of commercial cinema.
- I didn't want to get into any Amazon Prime Video show just like that. I was waiting for a big series to come where the script is good, the role is good and where there's great talent.
- Avenues opened right after I did 'Ship of Thesus' but doing films where there is big money involved or has big stars involved is not the reason I came to Mumbai.
- I'm a self-taught actor, which means that I had to learn everything on my own, as I wanted to know the craft deeper and deeper.
- The audience basically likes complex characters, and bringing out the complexities is the actor's job. The audience doesn't have the script, the actor does.
