- I'm a pretty laid-back person but when I first played on TV against Jimmy White at the Masters it was daunting. The more times you play you get used to it and you eventually come to love it.
- I've been world champion and number one at the same time, which is a brilliant feeling.
- When you watch Barcelona play you want to see Lionel Messi score two goals. If he hasn't after 80 minutes you can perhaps get restless.
- The crowd in big venues can really make or crush players.
- I always knew I could win tournaments in the U.K. but there was a question mark over whether I could deal with playing in China.
- When I was 16 I had a table at home in Melbourne and I hardly ever practised.
- If you are a single guy and work in a normal job you can get around it. But you can't win professional snooker matches when you are tired.
- You look at the guys who are winning tournaments , Ronnie, Ding, Mark Selby, Marco Fu - none of them are overweight, they are the slimmer guys on tour.
- When I first came to England I hated football and knew nothing about it. Watching 0-0s and 1-0s having come from Aussie Rules was just dull. The only player I had heard of was David Beckham. But when I was living in Leicester I started watching Match of the Day and really got into Chelsea.
- There's no way in the world any of the guys who have beaten me would have thought I could do what I've done. I just kept persisting with it.
- Snooker is a very good TV sport.
- There are a lot of players who fiddle around with their towel in your shot or they get up out of their chair to see if a ball's on when you're about to play your shot.
- I love the history of the sport and I want to keep keep building my history as a player with more records.
- Becoming a dad has been a big change for me - I didn't have any responsibilities before. I obviously practised every day, but there was that luxury of things like watching movies when I wanted or waking up whenever I wanted.
- I've tried to play within myself but I need adrenaline and need to be pumped up to play well otherwise you will see snoring snooker like that.
- We don't have that many tournaments so sponsorship from logos is another way of helping boost your income.
- You see stuff that is cheating, no question, and it needs to be sorted out. The biggest thing is moving on the shot by an opponent.
- I've got quite an addictive personality where if I start doing something I try to do it to the best of my ability.
- Now I've won everything in the game I'm just trying to repeat the success.
- The Worlds was great, Masters was great, but that was sort of mission accomplished with the Triple Crown.
- As long as your eyes aren't going, or you've got some back or neck problems, then you can play this game as long as you're motivated to practise.
- I fell off the tour when I was younger and had to go back home and practise harder and get better.
- The players who don't look after themselves physically and mentally and enjoy the nights out a bit too much will suffer, the sport is a lot more professional now.
- It's good to be No1 but you'd like to do it the right way, not because of something that might have happened off the table.
- The years I had the 100 centuries, I should probably have had around 120 because I got addicted like hell to 'Fifa 14.'
- If you're playing a shot and your peripheral vision picks up a player moving as you play the shot, if your vision goes from the object ball to what they're doing, you can miss the shot by several inches.
- The more muscle I'm losing, the better I'm cueing.

- If I get on a roll then I will steamroll people.
- None of the top players like the 128 system at all.
- Snooker has been really, really tough for me from a personal point of view because to be at the top and to stay at the top you've got to put the hours in.
- A long break can cause long-term damage to a player's technique. It can be dangerous for a snooker player to go 2-3 months without even touching a cue.
- I used to be very lazy in my teens. I didn't practise enough but I was OK when I started really getting into snooker.
- John Higgins is an absolute legend. He has such a good reputation.
- I wouldn't say I would have won a lot more tournaments if it wasn't for video games but I think I would have given myself more opportunities to go further in other events.
- I just play my game. I know if I play well I will win.
- We know how hard it is to travel around and if the schedules are really tight for you, it means you're doing really well because you're not going home early from many events. When you go deep in tournaments, that's the consequence you have to pay I suppose.
- I almost wrote my career off. I wasn't quite good enough and I thought that ship had sailed. But I carried on, won the World Under-21 Championship in 2003 and got the tour card.
- I absolutely love my cricket. I would watch it six, seven hours a day when Australia were playing. I grew up in a very spoilt era of Shane Warne, Adam Gilchrist, Glenn McGrath, Brett Lee, Ricky Ponting and others.
- With snooker, having three months off could have a huge long-term effect on your game. It's not like football, where there's a huge margin of error with touch and passing and shooting. With snooker you're talking about millimetre precision and your technique can vary a lot if you don't retain muscle memory.
- I'm good enough to win multiple world titles.
- It is impossible to play the best of nines and expect the matches to finish on time.
- Being world No 1 would be fantastic but you'd like to do it by finishing the year as No 1 without anything happening off the table to someone else's ranking.
- I have to motivate myself every season now to win things I've already won just to build my own legacy and try to end my career as high up as I possibly can.
- It is greed or financial difficulty that makes people fix matches, not gaining an edge over rivals, so it is different from say Lance Armstrong or Ben Johnson.
- Snooker isn't a sport where you can put on bulk muscle. It's about the cueing and the stamina.
- There needs to be a flat rule where if someone's playing a shot you sit in the chair, and probably more referees need to be a bit sterner with how they apply that rule.
- I think I'm a pretty calm kind of guy.
- I took coronavirus very seriously.
- I used to feel very tired during tournaments. I was drinking four or five coffees per day and felt I needed more.
- Health comes first before any bonus on offer.
- Lifting a major trophy in front of an empty stadium would be a very strange feeling. But then you'd rather do that than not play at all.
- I was heavily addicted to a game called 'Diablo II.'
- I have all the gym kit set up in my house but I am too lazy to get up really early in the morning to do it myself.
- Not many players have tables at home, they like going to a club and feeling like they're going to a place of work.
- I have tried to be that player who plays within himself, but I just can't do that.
- There are lot of tournaments and it's hard when you have a young family.
- Maybe one day there will be a snooker pin-up calendar if we all get in shape. I would be up for that, get some spray tan going.
- It's very frustrating when you don't always get the right kind of rub - you watch tennis and know if you play better than the other guy, you win. But that's the game we play. It can create mini-upsets.
- I have always tried to play the right way, and I honestly believe for the most part the etiquette in snooker is very good. So when there are breaches, and there are, it stands out.
- Before I play matches I'm always switching myself on. That's why I have that walk-on music - Two Steps From Hell - they produce really good motivational gladiator-style music. As soon as that music comes on I'm switched on and I'm ready for a brawl!
- We have to show zero tolerance on match and frame-fixing. There is no other option than a life ban.
- Every other sport has player's representation. We don't really have that officially - I know there's like a little players' committee but there's not a players' association, which is what we really need.
- I'm always looking to improve as a player and it's very pleasing when you see those improvements.
- It used to be that a lot of the ranking tournaments were in Britain so British players could just drive an hour up the road and be there. I've had to travel from the other side of the world to play and live in the U.K.
- Players thump their cue on the floor when the opponent is coming to the table, or at the table. And the referees need to show some more authority on this stuff. You don't see it so much with top players or on TV tables - they know they can't get away with it.
- Yeah, I came over to Cambridge with 500 quid in my pocket and I had to borrow a waistcoat off another Australian player. I couldn't afford to buy one.
- Being a champion is a dream come true.
- League of Legends' is banned in my house and rightly so. It is just awful. In the past, I've been staying up and playing it. Then all of a sudden, it is 6 A.M., the birds are tweeting and I'm thinking: 'Oh my God, I've got to get up in a couple of hours to take my son Alexander to school. Then I've got to practise.'
- I used to do too much weight training years ago. You probably wouldn't see it on me but I probably had a bit too much muscle.
- I've been watching Arnold Schwarzenegger. There's a couple of hour-long videos and he's made some amazing speeches. You look at what he's done in his career and it's such an inspiration with where he started. He's got these six rules of success which I listen to quite a lot and it really motivates me.
- There's no specific reason for it, sometimes results just go against you and your opponents play too well.
