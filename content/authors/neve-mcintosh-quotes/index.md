- I am such a tomboy. I grew up fighting with boys, mainly - beating up boys, actually.
- I tend to do yoga before I go on stage, so that keeps me nice and calm.
- I haven't done any 'Fringe' shows since I was about 17. Then I performed with my youth theatre in a show where we all had this old-fashioned make-up on and giggled through our lines.
- I've been a 'Doctor Who' fan since I was a wee girl.
- I used to have a lovely wallet with lots of different compartments where I kept photographs of my grandmother, grandfather and friends. It was stolen one night when I was out in Edinburgh, and I never got it back.
- Women are never the protagonists; we're always reactionary against everything that's done to us. I like people who write for women that have got a bit more about them.
- My first-night jitters are so bad, I can't even hold a tea cup, but once I am over that, I get really into it.
- I love being in London, where I live, for the shops, the bars and the clubs - but I equally enjoy going to my mum's house in Ayrshire and being able to sit on a cliff by the sea.
- In the Church of Scotland, Episcopalian, you don't have to believe in Heaven, but you definitely have to believe in Hell.
- I can't wait to work with Peter Capaldi as the next 'Doctor.' I know him from old; he's such a lovely man and will be brilliant in the role. As long as he tones down the Malcolm Tucker swearing.
- It's hard to get the downtrodden working-class wifey sometimes because 'You don't look like it'. Well, that's weird because I grew up on a scheme in Paisley. But everyone's got a viewpoint about what you should look like, and it's tainted by prejudices and assumptions.
- I love playing 'Madame Vastra.' Although I do suffer, spending three-and-a-half hours in make-up every morning to have her lizard skin put on. I was so excited the first day when we did the make-up test, but after six hours, I was like, 'Can we finish now?'
- Audiences are a wee bit more chatty in New York than in London.
- Some people have a persona that they bring, and I can't do that. It's just me that you get, I'm afraid.
- Fashion isn't something I madly follow. I tend just to wear what I like and what fits me well.
- I started horse-riding when I was a child and still try to go as often as I can.
- In Edinburgh, there was a lovely little Episcopalian Church of Scotland church on my way to the theater, so I used to pop in there and soak up the atmosphere.
- Thankfully, I have never experienced a miscarriage, but I have friends and family who have, and I've talked to them about their feelings.
- With some writers, the script looks beautiful on the page, but nobody actually speaks like that.
- I really admire medical people. They have a great sense of humour, and they just have to get on with it.
- You go for an audition, and you meet a director, and you find that they don't want you. You have to have a pull with them: that they understand what you want to bring to it. That you don't want to be the pretty little thing.
- Conflict is always more interesting to play. Not everyone gets along in the trauma unit. In a hard-pressed job like this, there will always be friction.
- I do worry because it takes all types to make our culture, to make our art. We need it to be available to all.
- For a little while there, I was thinking, 'I don't want to be in anything on British TV'. I didn't watch any of it because it was rubbish.
