- Women are coming into their own and breaking down so many boundaries.
- I was having a lot of issues with just a lot of social media trolls: people would try to make fun of my size and my weight to the WWE and what not. I just decided to go out there and post a picture of me in a bathing suit. I said, 'You know what? This is my body. I'm going to embrace it, and I'm going to show the world.'
- I get bullied for my size, my weight, and my look constantly. It's something that I'm glad we touched on in WWE. I'm glad we touched on it because it's real: it's something that happens in real life to kids all the time, especially in the age of cyber bullying.
- If I'm called to be on the grandest stage, at 'WrestleMania,' I'll be ready.
- Staying healthy adds to beauty. Even more importantly, it will increase your self-confidence. That's been my experience at least.
- I always had a love for the business. I remember hearing the stories about the patriarch of our family, 'High Chief' Peter Maivia, starting out wrestling in a rundown gym back in Auckland, New Zealand, then traveling the world, wrestling all over.
- Most challenging, mainly for me, learning how to bump, learning to trust your body and trust somebody else with your body, when we're learning how to do bodyslams and suplexes and figuring out how to kick somebody right while making sure to protect each other. In the beginning, for me, a forward roll was pretty challenging.
- The Performance Center in Orlando is the best place to go if you want to be a professional wrestler.
- On 'Raw,' I'm the big mean girl who goes and beats everybody up; on 'Total Divas,' they will see a softer, vulnerable side of me that definitely isn't seen on 'Raw.'
- Nia Jax is Nia Jax. That's something that I have been trying to get across. I am who I am in the moment. I'm not a heel. I'm not a babyface. I'm Nia Jax.
- I want young girls to be inspired to love themselves and strive to follow their dreams no matter what.
- Nia Jax is bringing a whole different message to the 'Women's Evolution.' Yes, we are athletic. Yes, we can go just as hard as the men, but women come in all different shapes and sizes.
- I guess I'm not too crazy on the road. I'm really like a freak - I always have to be driving.
- Sports helped me become super, super confident in my body growing up, especially in my high school and college careers. I wasn't going to be a hot prom chick that everyone wanted to go on dates with, but I was a stellar athlete.
- I really take pride in doing my own make-up all the time, which takes me about 40 minutes, and my hair takes another 15 to 20 minutes. Putting on my gear is probably another 15 minutes, so all in all, I don't think an hour and a half is too bad!
- I'm an athlete; my dad had made sure I played all the same sports as boys growing up, so I was always super competitive.
- I've always been a part-time model since I graduated from high school. I was hired by one of the major agencies, Wilhelmina in New York, so I modeled there and played basketball during the school season.
- I definitely feel that if somebody is struggling with themselves and how they look, they need to really channel the positivity within.
- Don't get me wrong: there have been many occasions where I wished I could be thinner or have a different nose or hairline to fit in, but I realized that fitting in is not always as important as it seems; I realized that I love standing out in positive ways!
- I have never been one to show off too much skin, and it's not just because I'm a larger woman.

- I'm definitely a person who works well under pressure.
- I'd love to work with Charlotte Flair; she's the best athlete in our company.
- Once I realized, when I became a plus-size model, that there were more women like me, my confidence immediately shot through the roof.
- Somebody we never talk about is Stephanie McMahon. She is such a huge power influence in our company. She is always pushing us to go the limit, and she doesn't take much credit for what she's done.
- Personally, I know that it's taken me a few different kinds of workouts to find out what's good for me because I completely relate sometimes, when I'm like, 'I don't really want to go to the gym because I don't want people to see me like this.'
- It's great to see men enjoying seeing female wrestlers and the entertainment that we're providing.
- I just want it to be normal for every fashion label to have all sizes. Completely inclusive - that's how it should be.
- I remember arriving to my tryout and being extremely nervous, but the second I stepped in the ring, I knew this was where I was supposed to be.
- That's something I've dealt with my whole life, people making fun of me and my size. Everything from having a huge forehead to the size of my feet, and not being able to wear the same size shoes as my friends, definitely.
- On 'Raw,' I'm more of a strong, silent type because I don't need to talk it up because I can back it up. But on 'Total Divas,' it's definitely different, because I'm unapologetically myself. I speak my mind, I'm goofy, and I like to have fun.
- This is who I am. I am never going to be a size zero.
- Obviously, Ronda Rousey and Alexa Bliss, I want to see how that one goes. I'm curious to see how Alexa is going to get out of that one.
- I have no problem breaking stereotypes. And proving people wrong - it's actually quite fun.
- Byron Saxton is creepy. He has a relationship between me and him going on in his head. I'm not included in this personally - like, I am, but I'm not. He has a weird fetish with my feet: he loves to call me different kinds of names, like 'Samoan Sweetcake' and 'Twinkle Toes.' It goes on from there.
- When I came back to go back to school on my time off from modeling, I went to Palomar.
- I considered wrestling at a young age, but I never could relate to any of the Divas. I have always been a bigger girl, and I did not think that WWE would want a girl my size, so I never expressed my dream to wrestle.
- NXT women have literally changed women's wrestling, and being able to be a part of the division is great for me.
- I'm inspired to post a lot of positive messages on my social media because, growing up, I felt as though I needed somebody that looked like me in the limelight or in entertainment to promote being different and promote accepting your differences.
- People who've never played a sport in their life come to WWE and can kick butt. On the other hand, people who've played football or some other professional sport can come here and get in the ring and not do what we do. It's a different tango.
- I just love being a part of what happens during SummerSlam week.
- I have nothing but positive things to say for anyone who wants to come to the WWE because it is not an easy place to get into and not an easy place to get through, so if you feel like you can make it here and get through, I say welcome.
- Our bodies are always going to change, and we might not always love that, but it really has nothing to do with true beauty. True beauty comes from within.
- A lot of people who've been athletes have come here and not been able to just pick it up right away. I hate using this example, and I love her to death, but Eva Marie. She was an amazing soccer player and athlete, but coming to WWE and getting in the ring was a whole different ball game for her.
- That's what we do in the WWE: we tell stories; we're characters. We go into the ring, and my character is telling a story in the ring against another character.
- Oh there's so many, but the one that I would love to see, that I would love to go up against, is Beth Phoenix. I would love for her to return. It would be something for me, kind of like a a childhood thing, growing up seeing her being such a dominant woman. I would love for her to show up and be in the ring with her.
- Roman Reigns is this larger-than-life Superman character, but the true Joe, Joe Anoa'I, is a very shy, humble guy, and he's super giving and loving.
- I've been bullied because of the way I've looked growing up.
- When I got to the WWE, I found out there were a lot of girls who looked up to me and that I was giving them confidence. I realized I'm not doing this just for me.
- Who wants to be ordinary? Be extraordinary.
- When you're initially a heel, it's easier to be a heel. I'd rather people hate me than try to get them to love me.
- Basketball is my main sport, which I got a lot of scholarships through, but I chose modeling over basketball, though.
- When I started coming on the scene, just really new into NXT, and people started seeing me, I got a lot of positive feedback from my friends, my friends back home. They were like, 'Oh, you are doing such great things for young girls,' and then it clicked in my head, like, 'Wow! I didn't know that was something I could do here.'
- Everyone is beautiful in their own way, and nobody should have self doubt.
- I submitted a bunch of names. Nia is, like, a Samoan girl name that a lot of women have. Jax is from 'Sons of Anarchy.' I was super into Jax, so I threw the name Jax in there, and it came about that way.
- Ronda Rousey has done... she was a huge part of the women's revolution all over the world and part of the WWE, and now she's coming to WWE. It's going to be absolutely amazing.
- I had actually had an injury that happened to me personally on a flight - an overhead bag fell directly on top of my head while I was on a plane. I was out of it; I was completely out of it.
- I wouldn't get asked to dances because I wasn't as petite and cute as the other girls.
- I know who I am and I know who I'm not. I'm different, yes, and I am big. But I love who I am.
- If others think I am good with myself, they will, in turn, feel good about themselves.
- I remember I was playing basketball, and an entire arena was, like, chanting 'Big Foot.' It was a high school game, but... you're constantly being reminded you're bigger; you don't look like everybody. There were days where I would be upset, and, like, I'd cry about it.
- I never thought I'd be able to spread the message of such body positivity, and just being positive in general, but I'm insanely grateful for it.
- When I was a young girl playing basketball, WNBA was a dream.
- You want to give the fans all the sides to women's wrestling.
- I never looked in the mirror and felt beautiful.
- Me finding my confidence took me a while, but now I love that I went through everything I did before to get to where I am now.
- Never allow a stigma or the popular thing to define you.
- I've been an athlete my whole life. I've played every sport, including soccer, baseball, softball, basketball.
- Growing up, we were a poor yet tightknit family. My mother worked multiple jobs and always made sure that her kids never had to want for anything.
- I have a positive outlook, but when you're out in the public eye, you wonder how people see you.
- My parents always kept my brothers and I in sports to keep us out of trouble.
- There are obviously times where I love to pig out and enjoy myself, but I always make sure to never lose my focus on being healthy.
- I always spread my message of body positivity and fashion for everybody.
- I did a lot of lingerie modelling, like, for plus-size, like Macy's and Dillard's and Bloomingdale's. I was, like, on a billboard in New York one time in, like, a bra and underwear. Yeah.
- My first name during my first match was 'Lena.' I was still Lena then, just because we hadn't gotten a name yet.
- Ultimately, I want to convey an image of a beautiful, strong, and confident woman.
- Even when I go out to the ring, yes, I am the big, bad heater monster, but I'm out there showing young girls that I can still be athletic just because I'm a big, bad heater. I can still go out there and cut promos like the other pretty girls and wear my hair down and put makeup on and do everything that they say that you can't.
- This is how God made me, and this is what my momma gave me. I am proud of this.
- You should always stand up for yourself.
- We are a very tight-knit family at WWE. We are very protective of our family. When an outsider comes in, you want to make sure the outsider is worthy to step into the family.
- Winning the championship at 'WrestleMania' was a dream come true because not only had it more than a decade since there had been a women's singles match at 'WrestleMania,' but the fact that I got to win it against my best friend in a storyline that was so close to my heart, it was just all kinds of emotional.
