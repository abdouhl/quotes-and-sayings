- The bigger the crowd the better really! The noise calms your nerves.
- It's just impossible to believe I've become good friends with some stars like Justin Bieber. I would call Justin a friend, someone I hang out with. It's really weird.
- Queuing tips for fans: wrap up and bring food!
- You have to think outside the box! Can you imagine One Direction and Eminem?! That would be hilarious.
- I think there's so much feeling among young girls where they feel like they have to be this perfect thing - and they don't. Perfect people don't exist. Sometimes people need to be told it.
- I'd rather be a kid and play with paper planes, than be a man and play with a woman's heart.
- I don't want to live up to how people expect me to be.
- Simon Cowell is tight. That's why he's so successful - he's able to keep his money to himself.
- I had a girlfriend when I was about 13 but we didn't stay together for very long and I've not really been out with many people since. I've still never had a serious girlfriend but I would happily go out with someone if the right girl came along.
- I've got an IQ of 40 million.
- I was starstruck by Michelle Obama. She's an amazing-looking lady, and I'm a massive Barack Obama fan anyway.
- I've not actually been on too many dates.
- I don't get to go home as much as I used to, which is a shame. But I don't mind because my mum moved over to London to look after me. I rented her a house just around the corner.
- I just like sitting at home, chilling and watching a movie.
- Fans always tell me I'm beautiful, but no one will ever be as beautiful as them.
- Someone told me the smile on my face gets bigger when I play the guitar.
- Katy Perry still gets me every time. She's very funny in person! We met at the Teen Choice Awards and she pulled my cheeks apart and told me how cute I was. My life was literally flashing before my eyes!
- You can see girls getting too excited and they start crying or worse. In a lot of these countries they don't get a lot of gigs to go to, so when they get to see their favorite artist they take full advantage of it. Obviously the excitement builds up too much for some on the night and they get a bit... crazy.
- I'm quite claustrophobic, and I don't like everyone crowding around and shouting the same questions.
- Katy Perry is the sexiest woman I've ever kissed. It was amazing and very purple - she had purple lipstick on. I don't think there will ever be anything cooler than kissing her... until I marry her maybe!
- I had my first kiss when I was 11, but I think I've blocked it out of my mind because it was so bad. I'm not even sure it counts as a kiss.
- Can clearly say Vegemite is horrible! Like tryin' new stuff though.
- Everyone gets that second album syndrome.
- I feel I am a little bit older. Reckon I will start growing a beard next week.
- A personal highlight was probably when we got a No. 1 in the U.K. and when the album went to No. 1 in America. The top four that week was us, Adele, Guns N' Roses and Bruce Springsteen. It was ridiculous seeing those names there. Being the first band from the U.K. and Ireland to go to America and debut at No. 1 is just unbelievable.
- 'Ted' made me nearly cry. It's kind of like 'Marley and Me.'
- I'm an emotional guy, so I don't have to worry about a girl trying to get me to open up.

- I'm the most carefree, happy person you'll meet.
- I'm not really a flirt; I just try to be myself.
- I don't see how you could get used to people screaming in your face, and anyone who says different is lying.
- A squirrel attacked me. I got attacked by a squirrel in Battersea Park. They're dangerous. It's rare. I've torn most of the ligaments in my knee. So no football for me. It's early retirement now. I've got a floating knee-cap!
- I want to sell out arenas and make an album and work with some of the best artists in the world.
- There's always pressure on the second album - this one has to be the big one.
- I actually haven't been on many dates, but I like just chilling around at home and watching a movie with a girl.
- When I have time off, all I want to do is do nothing.
- I get really nervous if pigeons are flying around before shows. I can't stand them after one once flew in through my bathroom window and went for me while I was having a wee. That was enough. I think pigeons target me.
