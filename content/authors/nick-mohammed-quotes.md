- I like places that are shrouded in mystery.
- After I finished university, I was gigging as a comedian in London as well as temping for Morgan Stanley during the day.
- I don't tend to read much comedy, but there's a fake advertisement section at the end of Derren Brown's book 'Pure Effect' which always makes me cry with laughter every time I come across it.
