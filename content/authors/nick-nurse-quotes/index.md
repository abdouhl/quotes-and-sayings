- I was getting a degree in accounting, and I was going to go off and account. And as it worked out, I haven't accounted for anything since.
- Football is a pretty complex numbering system most of the time: run the three back through the four hole, things like that. We kind of do the same thing - the three man sets for the four, or whatever.
- It used to be every single time you got the rebound, you handed it to the point guard, or you outlet it to the point guard, or everyone cleared, and you waited until the point guard brought the ball up the floor.
- Obviously, things evolve; teams see you play a little bit and start try to do things, and the one thing that'll happen is if one team has success in something, you can bet the next three teams are doing some similar things, too.
- I think I'm always a little bit under construction. I'm a project that I'm trying to improve upon.

- I was in love with the triangle because it was so different to what everybody was doing in the NBA. Everybody else was dribbling down, throwing it into the low post, and then their guy would go to work. To me, it was boring.
- You look at any roster and you say, 'Geez, he's pretty good. He's pretty good. He's talented. He comes off the bench?' All of a sudden, it's, 'Geez, that's a pretty good roster they got right there.'
- I'm gonna back my players.

- Your big has to be able to make 'em pay from the perimeter.
- I think it's really important that we get an experienced staff. Guys that have been a head coach, to me, at some level is important to me. I value head coaching just because it's good to know what it's like to be the decision maker.
- It's about what the players are doing. My job is facilitate that. My job is to put them in positions to succeed. My job is to listen to their ideas, take them if they're good, quietly push them to the side if they're not. My job is to help them grow.
- At some point in your life, you try to self-reflect and ask yourself, 'Why do I want to win so bad?'
- It's not like I'm shy or anything. I'm not.
- I know the 'big spending club v. smaller club' theme is popular in the Premier League. I don't think about it - we are 30 teams trying to win the championship, and you do what you need to do.
- I always say we're chasing perfection in an imperfect game.
- Long time ago, we used to sit around eating popcorn and drawing up plays.
- I think if you're going to be a little bit innovative or risk-taking, sometimes you're going to be wrong, and it's going to look bad. I understand that.

- I've known Adrian Griffin for quite awhile now and always had him as my 'when I get a job, I want to hire him if he isn't already a head coach and I can get him' list.
- I said it when I got hired. I said, for five years, I had a 1,000 people telling me I was going to be a head coach in the NBA. And when I got the job, those same 1,000 people were shocked.
- I didn't think reaching the NBA was a possibility when I coached Derby in 1990. I was right out of college when I went there and was more concerned about playing a bit and getting that out of my system.

- One of the things I like to do is let the players play and the coaches coach.
- I loved every job I had.
- The game's evolving quickly, man, and somebody's gotta be trying some new stuff.
- If you ask what my philosophy is, my philosophy is kind of like an entrepreneurial philosophy.
- An entrepreneur will do whatever they have to do to make sure things get done. Our coaches will be that way; our players will be that way. Just do what it takes.
- I think there's always enough right in front of me worrying about who's playing the minutes tomorrow, but you've always got to have an eye on a year or two from now and what those guys will do if you think, 'Well, let's give them a full year at the 905 and see how they progress.'
- For every philosophical idea about how we're going to do things, there has to be a plan to get there, and we have to be able to execute it, first in practice and then in games.
- You've got to coach with what you have and who's available.
- When I came back to England after my stint with Derby in 1995, I really wanted more time to study coaching.
- I just want to keep getting better. People used to ask me - when I was winning in the D-League - why I wasn't in the NBA, and I'd tell them, 'I just want to learn and get better.' I figured it'd happen one day, and if it didn't, I really enjoyed my time coaching anyways.
- I place a lot of value on pace of the game, going after people... always be the aggressor and forcing the issue a little bit when we have the ball, and when we don't have it, we want to come at you, too.
- As an assistant, you are grinding it out and churning out work like there are not enough hours in the day, really. As a head coach, you are doing similar.
- I know, when I'm walking out on the court before for the game, it's like, man, if you wanna compete, here it is. It's coming. That's something I really enjoy.

- Most of the places I came from, you gotta do a lot of gunslinging or coaching by the seat of your pants.
- I've coached a lot of teams and moved up gradually and tried to succeed and tried to have success at every level. When that happens, you just continue to wonder if you can keep doing it one more level.
- In the regular season, they all only count for one win or one loss. But for a team or coaching staff, these are tests, and you want to see where you're at.
- I like to have an attacking style on both ends.
- My goal early in becoming a head coach so young was to find out if I could do it. I just wanted to see if I could be a good head coach and then start learning from head coaching.
- Sometimes I'm in that timeout, and I say, 'Let's go a possession of zone,' and they're like, 'Yeah, let's do it,' and that shows that they're confident enough to roll with whatever we're doing. And sometimes they're like, 'No, no, no, no.' They don't want a possession to get away from them, possibly.

- Predictability can eventually be defended.
- I like to play aggressive, in general.
- When I started coaching, I wanted to find out quickly if I could do it.
- I call Kawhi the best team player in the league. He really does everything: he defends. He scores. He has been grabbing huge rebounds. He is a leader. His competitive spirit to win rubs off on everybody.
- The Energy job was probably the key. It kind of transitioned me back into the States. It gave me a link to the NBA. And I got to make some contacts and meet some players and get players set up and learn the NBA game and terminology and coaching those type of players. It was certainly a huge, huge key to getting to the NBA.

- One of my favorite things about the D-League was going on the road and losing and not having to talk to anyone after the game.
- I started at Grand View and all the England stuff. I just wanted to learn and get better, and that's kind of what the experiences were.
- Sometimes, I don't enjoy the wins, and I don't enjoy the losses, but I'm here just to get the result and get moving.
- I don't mind physicality in the least - I don't mind it in the least, both ends of the floor.
- I think there's some certain attitudes and certain guys that can feed some positive energy, and that keeps you going through an 82-game schedule.
- We've got to be innovative. We've got to think about what's coming next.
- Esthetically, let's move the ball. Let's guard people. Let's fight.
- It's such a long season, right? It's certainly serious business, but it's no sense that we all have to be miserable doing it.
- Why are people afraid to try something different? Because of the scrutiny they're going to receive if it doesn't work. That stops people from trying things different a lot.
- I'm getting older and mellower in my old age.
- Iowa is always home for me.
- People asked me, 'Why aren't you doing something more important?' When I was doing well in the D-League, they were like, 'Why can't you get an NBA job? Or a college job?' I don't think people thought much of what I was doing. That's fine. I was learning. Not just X's and O's, but team dynamics.
- As an assistant, when you wake up in the morning, you're opening your laptop and watching film. Then the game starts, and you're watching it until you finally fall asleep.
- I just think there are so many more good, talented players.
- In a game, I'm locked in. I maybe notice three rows in the stands the arena over, and that's it.

- I think we're always chasing a win once the ball goes up.
- I'm a guy that, when there's something rolling out there, the predetermined rotations might go right in the garbage can.
- I want to see given extra effort, pulling for your teammates: those are the kinds of things we're shooting for and we're going for because that's what we need.
- We've gotta be trying to think of what's coming next before it comes next.
- That's playoff basketball. Can you not get too happy after a win? Can you understand how determined the team is going to be after a loss and bring the energy you need to bring?
- I read a couple books on democratic coaching.
- I think I jumped the gun a bit on head coaching. I got named a head coach at 23, and I really didn't know what I was doing. I remember getting that job and going, 'Oh my God, they gave me the job.'
- The gym in Milton Keynes or wooden backboards at Chester - maybe it didn't feel that glamorous at the time, but it was fun.
- People talk about offensive chemistry all the time, but defensive chemistry is something you have to build, too, and there's a lot of that work to be done with just communications and the feel of who certain guys play.
- I just want us to be playing our best basketball here when the playoffs start, and in the right mindset.
- I've always been like that: after a loss, I go home and pass out and don't give it another thought. When I'm winning, I'm too excited.
- Hindsight is, of course, 20/20. Any time you go back, and you look at something, and now you've got the result of something, you say, 'Yeah, maybe it wasn't the right idea.'
- I think it's all machismo - 'Come on, you've got to guard your guy, man. If you can't guard your guy, then you can't play defence.' A lot of it is accountability, where you say, 'Hey, you're matched up with him. Go do your job.' The zone kind of sometimes moves a lot of pieces around.
- I think a lot of personnel decisions come down to who's the best player today, like if we had to throw 'em in a game today versus what could their upside be 18 months from now. A lot of times, those are two different answers. That's the difficulty of player personnel.
- I believe in getting the ball up the floor and trying to take advantage of transition opportunities.
- Fifty-nine or 54 or 52 or 49 wins isn't going to mean a whole lot. What's going to mean a whole lot to me, our organization, and our fans is how we perform in the playoffs and how deep a run we can make, and that's what we're setting our sights on.
- I used to say, as an assistant, I would go in and close my door for three hours after practice and just watch film. Now it seems like I'm in a meeting and then another and then another for three hours that have nothing to do with basketball. It's just different.
- It shouldn't be two separate styles between the first and second unit as much.
- It's really an organizational job with a football team to watch them go through their day.
- I tried to convince those guys at the Bullets in the '95-'96 season that they could try to beat the mighty London Towers, who won everything the year before. I got out of bed every day with the mindset of getting the team to Wembley for the play-off final and to win the championship.
