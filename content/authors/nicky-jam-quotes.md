- I'm a little bit of everything. That's what makes Nicky Jam so different from everybody else.
- Colombia changed the way I write and sing.
- To be a guy that disappeared from reggaeton for 10 years and come back, it can't be better than that.
- I first write melodies that will make people shiver, and then, I add the lyrics.
- I'm a real man. I can suffer.
- Colombians, when they love an artist, they love him whether you're up or down. So why wouldn't I stay in a place where they loved me when I was in my worse moment, and they were saying I was a legend? I felt I was good, so I felt it was my home. I fell in love with the people, the culture. They made me feel like a Colombian.
- I realized that if I did well in Colombia, I could do well in the world.
- If you're making music for the U.S. Latin fan, it's important that you sing in Spanish. Even going too bilingual can backfire.
- I have to write pretty songs; that's what gets them on the charts.
- I do very well with English, and I think I should do that more and take advantage of the versatility I have. I can sing; I can play guitar.
- I had no father. I had no mother after I was 8.
- What happened in my life made me a better artist.
- I love to see people's faces change when they hear me speak English, and they realize how far I have been able to go.
- Not everybody can sing - that's something I have.
- There are people who compose from very young. That is not my case. I went discovering myself.
- I don't see a Spanish song being No. 1 on the Hot 100. I mean, if it happens, fantastic. But I don't think it will.
- I didn't go looking to Colombia for a dream - if I tell you that, I'm lying. I went to Colombia because I needed the work!
- You listen to a song by Nicky Jam, and you don't think about reggaeton; you just think, 'I like that song.' I got old people listening to my music, young people listening to my music.
- Making movies is great. It was like love at first sight; a whole new, different business. I can see why actors love it so much.
- In Colombia is where I discovered myself as a writer.
- The mentality always in reggaeton was, 'I'm the man.' I made that cool to say, 'I messed up. I'm not the best.'
- When I'm in that studio, I feel like I'm the king of the world. If I lose that, I'm going to lose a lot.
- I've always wanted to work with Mana. I've been a fan of them since I started singing reggaeton in 1992.
- If I write songs trying to top other songs, it's a lot of pressure.
- We made history. Two Latin urban singers on the cover of Billboard is incredible. I'm proud of myself, I'm proud of J Balvin, our music, and of all Latinos.
- I was making too much money. I was too young. I didn't know how to deal.
- The way I'm seeing it, God has given me all this for me to realize that this isn't what I really need in my life.
- Al Green is something else.
- I want to go into the English market, all the way.
- Vin Diesel is crazy, and when I say crazy, I mean it in a good way. He's crazy about Latinos, and he's not even a Latino. He even wants to speak Spanish. I told him we should do a song together, and he said he was shy. But I said, 'I'm no actor, but I'm acting in front of you. I wasn't scared.'
- As a reggaeton act, I've always felt people are looking down on us and expecting us to fail. That's enough of a burden, and we automatically try to act with dignity.
- Medellin gave me so much. It gave me back who I am: the person I am, the human being I am.
- I love going to the beach. I like just walking around South Beach, but sometimes, when you're famous, it can be a little difficult.
- Puerto Rico got too futuristic with the electronic reggaeton. It lost the essence of the reggae music.
- I try not to think about the success, because it's pressure to continue making music.
- In the English market, I would love to work with Drake and Rihanna. Who doesn't, right? In the Spanish market, maybe Romeo Santos.
- The way you pronounce words the Puerto Rico way, it's not really global for music. Colombians speak some of the best Spanish in the world. So having a Colombian next to me every time I write makes my music more international.
