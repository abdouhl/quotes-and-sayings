- Driving in the rain, in real life, separates the men from the boys, I'd say.
- I remember the days of karting and kids were wearing Michael Schumacher helmets. When you asked kids what they wanted to do when they were older, they said they wanted to be the next Michael Schumacher.
- My parents are hard nuts. Especially my Dad. He never wanted me to struggle and he always wanted me to fight my own battles. He would never give me the easy option or the easy route.
- I just wanted to try and overcome my condition, with a lot of people telling me I couldn't do things and the only thing I could do was sit in my wheelchair and get bullied. Which is what I did.
- The first car I drove was a BMW M3. I drove it around a circuit close to my house. We just wanted to go and have some fun and didn't think it was going to be competitive in terms of lap times. But I ended up being faster than the instructors that day.
- Whilst I'm aiming to improve as a driver, I'm also hoping to inspire others to strive for their own personal goals, whatever their situation in life.
- I'm not a person who uses people.
- I think deep down my brother or my dad wouldn't like me to race but it's what I love, it's what I want to do so I'll always push.
- I was born on the back foot and have to play with the cards I have been dealt.
- I got bullied and got pulled backwards in my wheelchair and laughed at. I was the only Black person at my school, so I was very singled out.
- I can't jump in a car and drive it like most able-bodied people as we have to make pedals fit me and how my legs work.
- I would love to see disabled people be able to access circuits and access the industry.
- I always wanted to race but I never thought it would be possible. My dad put me in a cadet kart when I was seven years old and I wasn't strong enough to hit the brake pedal.
- I was told I would not walk and talk as a kid so having the ambition to drive, and the fact that I had to do everything myself, it's helped with me with my strength.
- Anyone can exceed expectations in one way or another and I hope to prove that when I race alongside, not just able-bodied drivers, but the best Touring Car drivers in the UK.
- As a family, when you're dedicated to motorsport, you eat, sleep and breathe the career. With us, we are all or nothing to the point that when we do something, we do it to the best or don't do it at all.
- Motorsport gave me a purpose. It gave me a reason to overcome my condition.
- If I'm going to try to achieve something, regardless of how tough it might and the obstacles I face, I grit my teeth and go for it or I don't do it at all. It's about reaching the goals you've set with the opportunities you've been given.
- I became a real racing nerd - I knew all the drivers and talked about karting all the time. I wanted to have a go, but when I got into a kart the noise scared me. I was also worried that I wouldn't be able to control the brake with my foot.
- I grew up playing simulation games - that's the foundation of my racing career.
- Motorsport is a really tough industry and there are a lot of people in the world who think because of who my brother is and all the money he has and how successful he is, that that is the reason why I am where I am today.
- I only had a couple of days' practice in the car before my first race. I was very inexperienced. There were a lot of things I had to overcome in my head.
- I'm basically a marketing director, a CEO and a racing driver all in one, because I have to understand why brands would want to partner with me and sponsor me and give me the support I need to race, because if I don't have the money I don't race.
- I try to use my story to try to inspire people in all walks of life.
- I don't want to be a disabled guy racing against others - I want to be a disabled guy beating them.
