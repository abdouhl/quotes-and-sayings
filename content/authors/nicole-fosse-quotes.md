- I'm much more aware of how distraught my father could be internally. That was normal to me - the obsession with work, the crazy hours - and when I watch it on screen I really see how enveloped he was by show business to the point where he didn't develop much of another life. Everything was show business to him.

- I always danced with my father in the living room. He did lifts with me, and he would twirl me around, and we'd laugh and giggle.
