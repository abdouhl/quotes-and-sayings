- I think advice is cheap. You can only really learn by doing and making mistakes.
- I'm very good when people dress me. But I find it difficult to spend a lot of money on clothes.
- One thing George R. R. Martin does is surprising things to main characters. But he says so himself.
- All actors tend to be the same messed-up people.
- What's great about 'Game of Thrones' is they change the perspective, the POV, all the time. So you will have one story told by one character and you'll go, 'Oh my God, horrible', and then maybe the season after you have the same story told but from the person you thought was just the most horrible, vile creature.
- Most female actresses will have a very difficult time being made unattractive.
- I actually met a cop who worked with street gangs. I wanted to understand what drives someone who deals with very hardened criminals on a daily basis. How do you turn that off when you go home at night?
- Horrible things happen all our lives; we all experience loss and death and trauma. Usually, most people, I think, we just get on with it. We don't have a whole soliloquy in the middle of something.
- I've never understood why you would turn down a great role.
- You have to be sharp when the camera's rolling. I want to be totally unselfconscious, like a child playing. I do as much prep as possible so I can lose myself for those seconds.
- It doesn't hurt to be in 'Game of Thrones,' that's for sure, mainly because people actually see your work, and that is great.
- Abusive relationships go on and on. You're in it for so long that it can almost be impossible to see it for what it is. That just becomes your life. We get used to and adapt.
- I've never heard of the wife looking up the mistress to become friends, but I like it.
- I always feel for the younger cast members in 'Game of Thrones.' They're really clever and smart.
- I haven't really got any hidden talents.
- I think the core of Jaime Lannister is actually that final line in the pilot when he says, 'The things I do for love.' He might do horrible things - and they are truly, some of them, horrific. There's no excuses. But he does it out of what he sees as a necessity, out of love.
- The only thing I find difficult to watch - horror movies - not that I don't like them. Like 'The Shining,' it's one of my favorite movies, but it's terrifying. I feel like I've watched a marathon afterwards.
- There's a Danish architecture firm called BIG. I love architecture, and I always check out their work; they're very good at reimagining the way we live. They put the human experience as the focus, with access to air and outdoor space.
- Divorce is always terrible, but I haven't met anyone who went through it and isn't happier now.
- Jerome Flynn is a great actor.
- I'm a fan of Ed Norton.
- Most of us have been in that situation where you've been falling in love with somebody who didn't feel the same way. It's not a nice situation.
- I know nothing more annoying when people I don't know jump to conclusions on my person based on nothing but gossip or speculation.
- I always wanted to be an actor, but I just never told anyone. I had this superstition that if I said it out loud, it wouldn't come true.
- I'm a fan of great storytelling.
- Usually, on a show like 'Game of Thrones,' you don't have much time to rehearse; a lot of the sets are not available.
- I think we all have the capacity of evil in us.
- Personally, I think fidelity is important. I don't see any point in being together if you're not being honest, having fun together, and respecting one another. Why would you stay in a relationship otherwise?
- My mum was a librarian, and my dad worked in Greenland.
- 'Game of Thrones' is so unique, and the odds that any of us involved will be in another show like it are very slim, so I'm enjoying the ride.
- I work a lot abroad and have the most wonderful family and kids, but being away, you do miss out sometimes. I really hope I won't regret the choices in the future.
- Still, to this day, I can't run on the treadmill. Why not just run outside? I never understood it.
- It's okay for a guy to be a baddie, but a woman? No, we can't deal with that.
- There's something liberating about watching someone not following the rules.
- I'm in a monogamous relationship and have been for many, many years. I think it's a choice. I don't think you can generalize, though, and what works for me may not work for other people, but I don't think everybody cheats. We're all different.
- There's a recent film, the Swedish movie 'Force Majeure.' I just thought it was brilliant.
- The most famous actress who did the 'dumb blond' routine was Marilyn Monroe, but she was a genius actress.
- I love team sports.
- I do remember a teacher telling me when I was about ten that I was really good at acting. I was so proud, even though I am sure he said that to all of us in the class.
- Most people can relate to that whole annoying thing when people think they know who you are.
- There's nothing exceptional about me, but there's something exceptional about Jaime Lannister, and I think that's what's interesting.
- I try not to regret too much. I find that feeling guilty takes up so much of my time already.
- Acting in 'Game of Thrones' is all consuming.
- I started at drama school at 18.
- When I was a kid I was always afraid of small dogs, because they always seemed like the ones that would attack.
- Burpees are great, but they just kill you.
- I did a network show in the U.S. before, and I loved it, but you have eight days to shoot an episode, and it's just a ridiculous pace.
- If you look at most of the Royal Houses in Europe, the inbreeding was pretty outstanding.
- I can't imagine life without my wife, but I don't think you should get a prize for staying together a long time.
- I couldn't pick up a sword and go fight anyone, let me put it that way. It's choreography and it's acting. The best sword fights you see look amazing, but it's the acting that sells it more than anything.
- A villain to me is someone who actively seeks to hurt someone or does things for his own gain.
- I think what's great is that, when HBO commit, they go in all guns blazing. They attract the very best set designers, the whole thing.
- You always dream of being part of a show that reaches and thrills an audience.
- What I love about acting is that you are exposed to so many different things. Horse-riding, sailing, travelling to amazing places.
- It's beautiful being out in the wild.
- Tina Fey's autobiography is very, very funny and very well written. It's her life story: it's about how she grows up in New York. There's no obvious reason why I should enjoy this - I mean, this is the autobiography of a woman in her early 40s in New York. I'm a guy from a small town in Denmark.
- My old mother, she has no idea what's going on in this world.
- I was 15 or 16 when I first saw 'Once Upon A Time In America,' so I was quite young, but I was completely blown away.
- I like to read everything, really, especially autobiographies.
- The more secrets and twists in a character, the better.
- I actually read somewhere that they measured how many calories you burn from watching movies, and horror movies are way, way up the list.
- Some of the stuff in Season 3 on 'Game of Thrones' - the amount of mud I had to eat, not intentionally but by accident - was pretty tough.
- Everyone's expectation of New York is so big, and then you go, 'Oh, it really is like no other place on Earth!'
- I like to be comfortable.
- I love skiing.
- You can be as good an actor as you want but, if your accent is too strong, it's going to limit you.
- I don't necessarily enjoy being at the gym. It's something I have to do, more than something I look forward to doing. But it does enable me to do fun things.
- When someone you love is in pain, you want to do anything to comfort them.
- Fart jokes still work for me.
- I like to wear beautiful clothes, but I don't have that many.
- Ever since I was a kid, I always wanted to be an actor.
- There are so many things to do in New York. I try to get to the theater and see some plays. I have a bicycle over here, and I ride around New York.
- My ambition has always been to work with English and American actors and directors. Those were the movies that I was watching when I was growing up.
- As an actor, secrets and obstacles fuel the character.
- I would be very wrong to charge anyone to watch me dance or sing.
- I'm a huge 'Breaking Bad' fan; I would be really annoyed if anyone told me anything about what was going to happen in the last eight episodes.
- When I was first told about 'Game of Thrones,' I didn't know the books, anything. So I read the pilot, and when I got the first script, it was clear the story was about these people and families and a constant battle for power.
- I like to be comfortable. If I go out, if it's a premiere, I'll put on a suit and look nice. I like Hugo Boss for that.
- I love political dramas. I love good story-telling.
- For my kids, it's just weird to see your dad pretend to be someone else. It's weird to see your father make out with another woman. It's not cool.
- I love to go into John Varvatos and look at the beautiful leather jackets. They're beautiful and soft. I try them on, and then I look at the price tag and go and pick up a t-shirt. It's just the way I am.
