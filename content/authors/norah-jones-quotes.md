- The pop world is cool, but I never really thought of myself as part of it or wanting to be a part of it because I'm on a label that's not really like that. They're not trying to dress me up, they're not trying to do things like that. I feel like I'm sort of separate from that, actually.

- I don't like shopping, and I like my clothes to be comfortable.
- People will read into what you say no matter what, so it doesn't matter to me.
- What I was going for in the first two albums I didn't necessarily achieve. Because I was young and because it was my first time out.
