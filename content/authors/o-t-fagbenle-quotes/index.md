- I try to encourage myself to act in a way that supports gender equality, and I call that feminist. Whatever word people want to use to call that, I'm not really attached to a label.
- I think, unfortunately, we've always lived in a world of massive inequality: inequality between the haves and the have-nots, inequality between men and women that not only exists temporally but geographically as well.
- My family is very nomadic - my mom, in particular, traveled the world as a young person, and her father before that, and I guess I have that inside me.
- I feel like within each of us is a million different people that we could reveal and that we can be sometimes... And for me, the process of acting isn't so much about finding the person outside of myself and mimicking them but, rather, releasing parts of myself and adding them to the character.
- Television is obviously changing; the way we consume media is changing, so I think it's natural that we are going to try different styles.
- My whole life, I have considered myself a feminist.
- As a man, having a conversation about feminism can be tricky - the best I can do is to have assumptions and ask questions. You always run the risk of putting your foot in it.
- My family are quite academic, and I was set to study economics and politics at university.
- I'm not averse to a bit of travel.
- As a younger man, I thought the best thing art could do was to challenge people's mindsets, and I still do, but I've come round to the value of entertainment. A show like 'The Interceptor,' which gives the audience that release, after a hard day, of just sitting down and enjoying themselves - that adds value to lives, too.
- 'The Interceptor' is gritty but also entertaining. The action is great as well.
- There are certain directors who just don't cast diversely in prominent roles. Ever. Often it's just because they don't have a diverse social circle, so they don't think of black or brown people as husbands, best friends, bosses.
- I think what often happens when people leave their spouse for someone else is they tend to go for the opposite of what they already have.
- The older I get, the more I dance like my dad, and I'm finding that suddenly cardigans are becoming more attractive to me.
- It's hard for men sometimes to talk about feminism, just as it's hard for people who aren't from ethnic minorities to talk about racial prejudice. It's a difficult conversation to have, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't have it.
- I came to the States less to find fortune and fame and more to kind of have a life experience of seeing something new.
- Love is a hard thing to turn your back on.
- I think when YouTube first came out, everyone was thinking people were just going to watch five-minute shows from now on and that people didn't have the patience anymore to watch longer programmes. But instead, everyone is binge watching and consuming ten-hour programmes and box sets of shows, so it is really interesting.
- I think what we forget is that everybody loses when we keep unnecessary privilege. The cost to society overall is much greater.
- As an actor, you can't play a flashback; you can't play someone's memory. You just have to play each circumstance as if it was real and understand that person's point of view.
- I think the two main tools actors have are the imagination of what other people have gone through, to connect with and through research, and there's one's own experience.
- We've seen from shows like 'Game of Thrones' that the book can become a seed, which you plant in the ground of great TV creators, and it can sprout out into a big tree.
- There's been such a pushback against political correctness, and I think that's due to the discomfort people feel talking about other people's issues that they don't fully understand.
- I'm interested in working with great people and exploring great themes in different mediums.
- I really want to do Broadway.
- Elizabeth Moss may very well be one of the best actresses I've had the privilege of standing opposite and sharing lines with.
- It's funny because I was looking back on my Instagram,, and I saw that I had a bunch of feminist posts but that was all before 'Handmaid's Tale.'
- 'The Interceptor' has an excitement and grittiness to it, but it's also very entertaining. It lives in this sphere of a slightly heightened reality where, although you completely identify and recognise all the characters in it, they're fun and exciting to watch.
- I'm hungry as an artist to find opportunities to contribute to the world in a more meaningful way than just numbing people through entertainment.
- I've always had an explorative drive to my art, as opposed to wanting to achieve some certain goal.
- We all fail, and we all have weaknesses. I think that's what helps us relate to characters we see on TV or read in books, is that we recognize our frailties within them and maybe don't feel so alone. We get to learn from their mistakes.
- 'Handmaid's' is the most profound television I've had the privilege to be a part of.
- I loved doing my own stunts, and so, as much as the insurance people would allow me, I would get involved.
- My full name is Olatunde Olateju Olaolorun Fagbenle. I was named after my grandfather. It's Yoruba, which is, like, southern Nigeria.
- Oakland's got a lot of character.
- We moved back to Britain for my secondary education.
- When representation of the LBGT community was much more scarce in the media, I think there was some kind of pressure to encapsulate an entire community in a single character - this can often be a fast track to generalization and stereotypes.
- We have flaws, things go wrong, people's hearts get broken, people make mistakes, people fall in love with other people. And that's hard, but that's also part of life.
- I think you can judge a man by the size of what offends him.
- Reed Morano is an amazing woman and one of the most extraordinary people I've had the chance to work with.
- Words can be an act of reductionism.
- I'm interested in colour-blind hiring of directors, producers, and writers. Go to the source. Then we won't need to have conversations about colour-blind casting.
