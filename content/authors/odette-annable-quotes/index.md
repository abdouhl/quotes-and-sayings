- I had always wanted to lend my voice to a character. I did a voice for this video game, called 'Fallout 3,' and that was really fun.
- When you're bullied in high school, even if it's the smallest amount, or you're actually tortured, I feel like everybody carries that with them. They always think of that one person who treated them badly in high school.
- I'm Cuban, so I like a bit of curve. I just want my booty to have a little lift!
- Hiking is something that I really, really like to do. It's distracting, you're in nature, and you get a nice workout that way. I would tell everyone to hike as much as they can - you just feel so much better when you get outdoors. I'm also into yoga.
- I think I'm pretty fearless. I like to try things at least once, things that I never thought that I would try.
- I'm Latin, for crying out loud - I can't hold anything back!
- If you ever were bullied, you'll always remember that feeling.
- 'The Exorcist' is absolutely my favorite horror film, and I watched it when I was, like, seven years old with my mother for the first time. I don't know why my mom let me watch that. I couldn't go to the bathroom by myself. I couldn't go upstairs by myself. I couldn't sleep.
- I just love scary movies. I love the thrill.
- When you're shooting a movie, it's two months of your life usually. You don't really have time to see anybody else. Your friends are put on hold while you're shooting, and what you have is the family that you create on set.
- If women just got into it a little more, then the world would be happier. Instead of stabbing each other behind the back, just get into a fight, and then everything is out in the open.
- I did a voice for this video game called 'Fallout 3,' and that was really fun. I had a great time, especially since I could show up in PJs and not have to worry about how I looked.
- I'm kind of in between organized and messy, so if I have the right things to keep me organized, it's easier for me to stay that way. If I don't have the right tools, I'm a train wreck.
- I have some girls who I look back on and I think, 'Wow, they were really horrible to me.' I would love an apology from a few girls, but whatever. I'm not holding any grudges. I'm over it.
- I'm obsessed with socks. I even wear them to bed!
- I used to try to pick locks because I grew up on my grandparents' farm and I started my own little spy club. I would go around the farm and try to break into the shed and try spying on my grandpa. It was ridiculous.
- Betty White is a riot. She is a good time! That is the bottom line: Betty White is a good time. She is really an incredible woman. She is so kind. She doesn't have one mean bone in her body, and she is the funniest woman in the room always. And you'll never hear one complaint from her.
- I'm kind of a crazy person about hand sanitizer. I carry the plain ones that smell like aloe, from Target or CVS.
- Beauty is what attracts men naturally, but really I think we dress for other women, not necessarily for men. We torture ourselves every single day, and I wish that we wouldn't because we should all just get along, really.
- I have superfine, superoily hair, so my struggle is always trying to get the volume I want. I end up not doing much with it ever.
- I like second chances. I've given people second chances. You have fall-outs with friends, and forgiveness is a great thing to have. It's not easy to forgive. I definitely don't forget, but I do forgive.
- I think everyone should live in New York City if they ever get the chance at least once in their life. It's such a great place to live; there's a different energy about living in the city.
- Richard Gere's got this very old-school Hollywood charm. He has a presence that when he's in a room you just feel him. I mean, I'm married, but he's sexy!
- I learned Spanish at home and, since half my family doesn't speak English, it's my first language.
- I can't even be around children. It's a problem. My ovaries start screaming.
- My first audition happened to be for 'Kindergarten Cop,' and I took that role. I was only starting to learn English at that point. Spanish is my first language, so they made me a speaking character in the movie. I didn't really know I was shooting a movie. I was just having a lot of fun with 30 kids my own age.
- Rihanna is always on my playlist. I think she pumps you up and gets the day going. I also love - and I know this doesn't sound like a workout album - the Lumineers, lately, and Taylor Swift.
- I had a great time in high school. I really did. I went to a private Christian high school and I graduated in a class of 67 kids, so it was pretty small, and I knew and loved everybody.
- I love all sorts of music. I'm really into Damian Rice and Amos Lee.
