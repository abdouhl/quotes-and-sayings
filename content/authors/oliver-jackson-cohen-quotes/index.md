- I remember being told very early on, 'Just say what they want to hear in the audition, and we'll figure it out later on.' So there have been a few tricky moments. I once said I could ride, when the truth is I'm terrified of horses, but I got the job!
- It's never fun having to bulk up for a job on an action film, then lose weight for another role. I don't actually mind working out, but it's the diet: I'm half-French, so I love my food, and boiled chicken breast for breakfast is not my idea of a good meal.
- When I started acting, everyone told me to get a backup in case it didn't work out; if there was something else I could have done, I would have done it. Acting should never be your chosen path if you can help it.
- I had this maroon 'Lion King' tracksuit that my mum couldn't take off me. I wore it until the sleeves ended at my elbows and the trousers ended at my knees.
- I love Dior and Commes des Garcons, but I can't really afford them.
- There's so much fakeness in the fashion world, but Mum and Dad have always given us a good work ethic and were quite worried at first about whether I could make a living from acting. They've been together for 29 years and share the same values. I really do want to have that kind of marriage myself.
- Acting gives me an adrenalin rush I don't get from anything else.
- For a long time, I so badly wanted to work with Jeremy Piven, and I ended up on 'Mr. Selfridge' with him. He was such a character - so brilliant to work with.
- I went to the premier of 'Stardust,' which starred Michelle Pfeiffer. I nearly died when I saw her on the red carpet - she's so beautiful.
