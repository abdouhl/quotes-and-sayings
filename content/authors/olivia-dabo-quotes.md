- Doing Broadway was always a dream of mine since I was a little girl.

- You want to find out what it is about you or what it is about your past and your lineage that's in you now, and whether you carry those traits and maybe what one's mission is to take it to the next level.
- I think one's history and past is important at a certain time in your life, especially as an artist, just to try to hone in on that.
- With thrillers, there's such a fine line between what's good and what's cheesy and corny.
- Music has always been a huge passion in my life. I've just had such success with my acting that it's really been right alongside of it, and I've always been writing and playing and singing.
