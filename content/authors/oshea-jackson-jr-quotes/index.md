- The trials my father went through were things most young black males have to go through. There was nothing he shielded from me, because it doesn't matter how you grow up, those who oppress will oppress. It's all completely relatable; everyone feels NWA.
- Our trials and our times of pain get the most recognition, but 'Straight Outta Compton' speaks to triumph. When it's doubtful, when nobody is on your side, when your back is against the wall, you triumph and make it through. Showing growth through movies promotes growth.
- I want to pursue a career in film.
- This entire cast, N.W.A, was an all-star group, and I really feel like people are going to look at 'Straight Outta Compton' years from now like this was an all-star cast.
- USC has really developed my love for the cinema.

- Being on set with my dad - that's so cool. People always ask me if that made me nervous, but it's the same element when you're a kid - when your parents come in the auditorium for those school performances. It calms you.
- Ice Cube's the coolest dad. A lot of parents - a lot of kids do not think their parents are cool. Oh, no. My dad's cool... You know, I was born in 1991. That's when 'Boyz n the Hood' came out. So I've always see him on TV. I don't see everybody else's dad, you know. So I've always had a sense of, you know, he's cool. He's in the light.
- Have confidence in everything. No matter what it is that you're doing, know that you can do it better than anyone.
- I want more movies like 'Straight Outta Compton.' Showing our stories of triumph, we'll make it through, and we'll get to something better.
- The stress and turmoil that my father had to go through at a young age to make sure that I didn't have the same trials and tribulations, I couldn't be more grateful.
- My parents wouldn't have sent me out into the world with wool over my eyes. You have to be aware, or you'll be swallowed.
