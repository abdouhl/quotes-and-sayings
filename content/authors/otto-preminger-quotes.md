- I stopped acting when I was 19. The only time I acted again was during the war, when there were no other Nazis available.
- I do not welcome advice from actors; they are here to act.
- I never seek controversy or foresee it for my pictures. I take a personal stand, and perhaps because my films are on contemporary subjects, people do not share my point of view.
- When I finish a film, I want to forget it. I never like to repeat myself. Maybe, when I am dead, they will find certain consistencies in the style of my films, but I never want one film to look like another.
- Directing Marilyn Monroe was like directing Lassie. You needed fourteen takes to get each one of them right.
- I live in the present. When I finish a film, it is behind me. My reward is in my work, not in a lot of old memories.
- When I was a young actor in Vienna, already my hair was falling out at a rapid rate. I went to a doctor, who said hair was like grass: if you mow it, then it grows back stronger. So I went to Brittany, where nobody knew me, and I shaved my head. When it grew back - only the fringes!
- I can't talk about every single film I made. It's not my way to go back into the past and to look at my old pictures and to discuss them.
- Directing her was like directing Lassie. You need 14 takes to get each one of them right.
- What counts isn't the frame, it's what you put in it.
