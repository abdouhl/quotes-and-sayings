- My mother is the toughest opponent. Many people think she would go easy on me, but that's not the case.
- It's very, very important to be yourself, and that's the kind of message that I want to get across in my character as well. On TV, that's the message that I want to get across to fans of all ages, really: To get somewhere, you just have to be yourself. Don't ever change for anyone.
- My dad was always a great talker on the microphone, so I tried to learn a lot from him in that way, and he's very old-school. He built the wrestling family that we have.
- I was at rock bottom for a year and a half - and the people who got me out of my rut were my fans.
- Not only was I a victim of viral humiliation but a victim of cyber-bullying.
- When you think about a WWE Diva, you think of us girls in WWE, not, like, the girls that are in the indies, the girls in TNA or in other different companies. So yeah, the word 'Diva' means a lot to me.
- I'm not a bad person.
- I like the fact that 'Total Divas' give you a behind-the-scenes look at what really happens.
- My sister wrestles. Both of my brothers are wrestlers, and my nieces and nephews all plan to wrestle.
- You can always tell the difference - who is a wrestling fan and who is a 'Total Divas' fan.
- I want everyone to know that they can accomplish anything they want at any age if they just be themselves. I want to encourage millions to chase their dreams and to never change. Everyone should also know how to throw a good right hook!
- I'm a little bit of an adrenaline junky.
- I love karaoke.
- At 13, I knew where I wanted to be. I wanted to be in WWE.
- Any time I have a promo with him - and I like R-Truth, too - but I always have the best chemistry with Miz. We really don't stay on script perfectly. We kind of bounce off each other... He is the one I paid attention to when it came to promos. He helped me so much along the way with backstage segments.
- I'm not a glamorous girl.
- I'm going to be a little bit biased, but I feel Sonya Deville is very underrated.
- I'm not a huge video game person. I used to always play wrestling video games growing up. My brother used to have all the games, so we would play together.
- WWE, I'm just full-on Paige, my in-ring character. 'Total Divas' is where I can completely be myself and be my lunatic, weird person.
- I get the weirdest comments on Instagram.
- NXT is a land of opportunity.
- My whole family are wrestlers; I was brought up in the business.
- Wrestling-wise, I've wrestled a lot of the girls that I've really wanted to, like Natalya and Emma.
- If you're trying to be something you're not, you can see right through it.
- Hopefully, one day - I want to make this big goal and be in the WWE Hall of Fame one day.
- My guilty pleasure is just eating really bad food. I cannot help myself, but you're on the road during the night, and the only thing open is a fast food place, and you're like 'Alright. Not my fault. It's time to eat.'
- I try to be very positive. I surround myself with positive people, and the negative people can leave.
- When I first came up in the wrestling business, there was a movie called 'The California Dolls' about a female tag team - girls who are struggling trying to make it in the wrestling world. I started out in a tag team, and my name was Britani Knight, and my dad named us after The California Dolls. We were called The Norfolk Dolls.
- I have a message about how you should completely be yourself and not give a damn what everyone thinks about you. Look how you like; you're amazing how you are.
- I started traveling around the world by myself by the time I got to 14. I worked really hard because I knew what my goal was, which was to be in WWE.
- Maybe I could manage someone and be the female Paul Heyman.
- When I got a little older, like, 10 or 11, my dad would run a training school every month, teaching people how to become wrestlers. I would get in the ring now and again and mess around with one of my brothers, and he'd teach me some stuff.
- Emma gave me some of my favorite matches - the NXT Women's Tournament and then NXT ArRIVAL.
- Cheesecake and cookies is something I can't stay away from.
- The great thing about WWE is the fact they are branching out and doing more brands. Having this just creates more opportunities for everybody, and I just want them all to get a chance. Especially in England. I know we have a lot of British superstars, but it's still a lot harder for Brits to come over here in America.
- I always really enjoyed Edge's entrance theme. Also Stone Cold. WWE once asked me in an interview, if I had to change my entrance music, whose would I choose, and I said Edge. So they created a video of me using that song, and I was like, 'I'm in love.'
- I feel much better being in a heel role. I'm not very good at coming out smiling and acting like a good girl. It's harder to get fans to like you when you're trying to be nice.
- I always sing Amy Winehouse's 'Valerie,' but also Kings Of Leon's 'Use Somebody.'
- I would love to have a Divas Money in the Bank. That would be cool.
- To be the first NXT Women's Champion is such an honor.
- WWE is like a big family, and you don't realise that until you step away from it and come back.
- I grew up watching Bull Nakano, and she was amazing.
- People who are not in the wrestling business don't understand the struggles that all of us have to go through to really try to make it.
- I find it really hard to be close to anybody.
- My mom, she's just a baller in the ring. My scrappy side and my aggressiveness are probably coming from her.
- I'm not good at opening up with people.
- First and foremost, that was always my passion: I wanted to wrestle, but unfortunately, it took me down a road that I can't do that anymore.
- I would love to have a Divas Hardcore championship. If we had a hardcore cage, we'll just paint the cage pink or something and make it extra girly so it's so, like, Diva.
- I couldn't really get a grasp on wrestling at a young age. I knew it was what my parents did, and they fought people. It scared the crap out of me, so I thought, 'No, I can't do that. I'll get beaten up!'
- I got a large fanbase just from NXT itself. It's an amazing brand.
- I love being the bad guy.
- When I was in England, I did a lot of wrestling and moves. Over here, they were like, 'You don't need to do that much. Save your body. Become an entertainer rather than a wrestler.' And I wasn't used to wrestling on TV and in front of huge crowds, so it was a big adjustment.
- I was born into the business, literally. My mum was seven months pregnant with me before she realized it, so she kept wrestling like normal up to that point.
- People are very surprised when they see me. Here is this crazy Gothic woman, but when they speak to me in person, they realize I'm a nice girl. I love to interact with my fans.
- I love Stone Cold. It's a weird obsession, and he should probably get a restraining order.
- Everything I knew my entire life - like, literally, for 26 years - all I had known was pro wrestling, and for it to be ripped away from me, which is nobody's fault, but it is part of our business.
- I have traveled the world by myself.
