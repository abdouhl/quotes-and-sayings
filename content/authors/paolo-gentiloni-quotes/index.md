- I am not in a position to be accurate on news analysis. But what I firmly believe is that Iranian President Rouhani and the government have committed themselves to a process. I don't think this process is about changing the principles of the Islamic republic, but it is about accepting a certain path of opening in the political and economic fields.
- The E.U. cannot give up on common solidarity. The idea that every country does its own thing, and history and geography decides whose turn it is - whether Greece or Italy or Spain or, who knows, even Poland if there's a crisis in north-eastern Europe - that just can't be. There has to be a common policy.

- Italy is a free country. Its voters decide freely.
- On immigration, Europe is in danger of displaying the worst of itself: selfishness, haphazard decision-making and rows between member states.
- Responding to terrorism inevitably implies military consequences. This may shock some people, but these groups must also be dealt with on a military footing. I won't use the word 'combat' to avoid being painted as a crusader.
- We must not forget that culture is the key tool to make society advance and defeat all forms of radicalism.
- We always have to remember that we, the Italians, have always cooperated with the U.S., and with Reagan and Carter and Nixon and Clinton, Bush and Obama. And Trump, Trump is the American-elected president. So, cooperation is there.
- Italian design is a global excellence, on a par with food, culture, cinema, and, more generally, lifestyle.
- I want to say very clearly that the government... is ready to intervene in order to guarantee the stability of banks and the savings of our citizens.
- Europe - with hundreds of millions of people - can accept hundreds of thousands of migrants.
