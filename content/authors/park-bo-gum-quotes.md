- Currently, I work as an actor, but I still love music.
- I just try to stay focused and show the goodness in me to people.

- When I was young, I really wanted to be a part of the end-of-year awards shows, but now that I'm actually there, it feels weird. I used to go to church and ended the year with a prayer, but now I spend it with people I'm not very familiar with at an award show, and I wonder if it's something I should be doing.
- I just want to be more willing to listen to many people and be cautious about what I'm doing.

- Before, I could meet and greet all my fans one by one, but now, it's hard to remember all of their names. And my actions can sometimes cause misunderstandings. If I bow to one side, I've heard people from the other side ask why I didn't bow there.
- If I were to have the opportunity to work with Joong Ki, playing brothers would be good, but anything would be great as long as it was with Joong Ki.
