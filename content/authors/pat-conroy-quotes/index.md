- The University of South Carolina has always played a role in my life and the intellectual life of South Carolina.
- I told my kids when they were little, 'Look, kids, your mother and I are screwing you up somehow. We don't understand how, or we wouldn't do it. But we're parents. So somehow we're damaging you, and I want you to know that early. So just ignore me when I go to that part of my parenting.'

- Writing has never been that simple for me.
- I never read my reviews... not even the good ones. Barbra Streisand once told me, if just one person in the audience doesn't applaud, it bothers her. I'm the same way. I'd be devastated to read that someone didn't like my work.
- I became a novelist because of 'Gone With the Wind,' or more precisely, my mother raised me up to be a 'Southern' novelist, with a strong emphasis on the word 'Southern' because 'Gone With the Wind' set my mother's imagination ablaze when she was a young girl growing up in Atlanta.
- The great thing about all my siblings is we all agree we had a horrendous childhood. It's not like it doesn't affect us now; it affects us every day, in everything we do.

- A recipe is a story that ends with a good meal.
- I still write in long hand. I type like a chimpanzee.
- I'm not the lovable, wonderful, tenderhearted grandfather that you read about in books. I'm grouchy and curmudgeonly, and I have a lot of rules.
- I've met many, many writers who say they would never write about their family, never write about people they did not totally make up. But that is not the composition of my character.

- My father wouldn't let me take typing in childhood.
- My father's violence is the central fact of my art and my life.
- Though Nathalie Dupree did not remember much about my presence in her class, it marked me forever. I remain her enthusiast, her evangelist, her acolyte, and her grateful student. She taught me that cooking and storytelling make the most delightful coconspirators.
- I love books about treks and journeys into the unknown.
- There's always a version of me who is the narrator. And I make myself look better than other people.
- Let me now praise the American writer James Dickey. In 1970, his novel 'Deliverance' was published. I found it to be 278 pages that approached perfection. Its tightness of construction and assuredness of style reminded me of 'The Great Gatsby.'

- A family is too frail a vessel to contain the risks of all the warring impulses expressed when such a group meets on common ground.

- To Southerners like my mother, 'Gone With the Wind' was not just a book; it was an answer, a clenched fist raised to the North, an anthem of defiance.
- When I bought a collection of Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky, I returned home with a bright enthusiasm to begin the long march into the Russian soul. Though I've failed to read either man to completion, they both helped me to imagine that my fictional South Carolina was as vast a literary acreage as their Russia.
- I only hope to do well enough before I die to have a house as big as my rich Uncle Ed and Aunt Carole.
- The most powerful words in English are 'Tell me a story,' words that are intimately related to the complexity of history, the origins of language, the continuity of the species, the taproot of our humanity, our singularity, and art itself.
- It's an article of faith that the novels I've loved will live inside me forever.
- I would love to see young writers come out of college and know there is a possibility to be a novelist.
- I could not bear to think that I wrote a five-hundred page novel just because I needed to love my father.
- I mark the reading of 'Look Homeward, Angel' as one of the pivotal events of my life. It starts off with the single greatest, knock-your-socks-off first page I have ever come across in my careful reading of world literature.
- I'm fascinated by the people I grew up with and the mistakes I made - and God, I have screwed up. I like writing about where it all went off course.
