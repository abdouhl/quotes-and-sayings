- We're looking to help our guitar buddies do their thing while at the same time we try to create something we might enjoy listening to ourselves. If anything we are trying to develop a vocabulary so we can converse more fluidly.
- I love to play with Tony and Bill anytime, anywhere.
- I like tinkering with the tribe beat boxes and love using Reason as a beefed up beat box.
- Crim has baggage: expectation, history, responsibility.
- We have a very loyal fan base, the kind tat buys the record the day it comes out, sees every show, and that's fantastic, but what about the people who would never hear about our band?
- My roots are more in he Beatles, Zeppelin, the whole 60's side.
- Not really, drums found me, I just liked music, all kinds of music.
- If Bill jumps into something that relies on a lot of cymbals, I'll jump into something that relies on a lot of skin sounds; if he goes into metal tones, I'll go into wood, and so on. I basically play in his holes.
- I like almost everything, even country twang, disco, blue grass and accordions.
- I think basically lables were more interested in a Richard Page record than a Mr. Mister record.
- I don't know of any plans to remaster the Mr Mister catalog.
- My drumming is always an experiment.
- Sorry, no, I'm never satisfied with my drumming.
