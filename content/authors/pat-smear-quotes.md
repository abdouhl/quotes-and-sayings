- My Nirvana experience was much different than the other three guys. For me, it was really new and exciting. I was just a guy from a punk rock band, thrown into this huge thing. There were dark periods, too. But there wasn't a dark cloud over the whole thing.
- I've always been in a band where it's been somebody else's band - or pretty much always.
- Interviewing is fun. You get to learn things about people other than yourself. When you're being interviewed, you're talking about things you've already lived. I've already done that, so what fun is that?
- We'll always play different venues. We'll play small clubs or stadiums or things in between.
- I remember when I was a kid and I used to go and see Queen play live. It was like there was Queen the album band, and then Queen the four dudes on stage playing the songs on stage, and it never lacked anything to me when it was just the four dudes playing the big songs.
- I just feel like bands with the same people, no matter how different the band themselves thinks it is, the listeners go, 'Oh, yeah, it's another Nirvana record.'
- I really liked falling in love with cities that I had actively disliked before.
- I didn't own a guitar when I was in the Germs. I would just borrow one from the opening band.
- I know Nirvana's a strange thing. It means a lot of things to a lot of people.
- I'd like the records to be remembered just for the music.
- I've always liked to dress up. I'd choose a halter top over a Led Zeppelin T-shirt when I was in high school.
- Drummers are like sharks. They have to move all the time or they die.
- My parents didn't allow rock music in the house. I actually didn't even know it existed until I was probably eleven years old.
- When we did the 'Skin and Bones' tour I didn't even own an acoustic guitar, I had to borrow one from my friend.
- I've always been attracted to the gayish side of fashion. It's just more interesting.
- I had heard all the rumors and controversy swirling about the 'In Utero' recordings - there was a lot of, 'Oh, the record label hates it,' it was going to ruin the band, that kind of stuff.
- I'm just really interested, when a band plays and they think they sucked from a band perspective.
- I learned a long time ago with guitars and amps or anything else, whatever band I'm in, I'm just going to sound like me anyway, so I just stay true to that.
- With the Germs, every night's a little mini-riot, bottles flying at my head.
- A band's best and worst shows really aren't that far apart.
- I've only ever been in bands where I can be the punk rock guitar player in the band because that's all I want to do. I don't even know if I could do anything else.
- I've actually done bands where it was my band and it was never fun and it wasn't the right place for me and, whatever, it felt weird.
- The Germs' contribution to history sucks as far as I'm concerned.
- I probably own 100 guitars and all of them are electric.
