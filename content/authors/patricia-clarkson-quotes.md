- See, the SAG awards caught me totally by surprise.
- It's never easy with characters in these dark and grave circumstances but that's my job.
- I think it kind of took being a character actor to kind of now enter into leading ladies.
- Why are comedic parts for women the exception, not the rule?
- Well did graduate summa cum laude from Fordham University.
- When I was younger, of course I had people act inappropriately to me. I've had certain directors yell at me. But I didn't stand for it, and I didn't let it go far enough for it to be in any way abusive to me.
- I'm really a director's actor. I rely heavily on a director.
- The odds are not in your favor the older you get, especially if you're a woman in this business.
- I don't like a lot of rehearsing.
- And now oddly I'm getting sexier parts than I've ever gotten.
- There are still so many movies made starring 50 men and one woman! A white male actor should never be allowed to complain about anything. Shut up and sit in the corner. I mean, seriously!
- I just have a thing for writers. Maybe it because I'm just so not a writer.
- I'm obsessed. I've always needed to know what's going on but now it's a must.
- Being married and having a child was not something I wanted, and I knew that at a very young age. I tend to be more solitary, and I'm truly a free spirit.
- But no, had I been successful in my 20s I would have been just fine. But it is nice to defy the odds.
- I think it would be hard to go the distance in this business without a sense of humor.
- You're always close and you never get that big romantic lead.
- New Orleans. Born and raised. I lived there until I was 19.
- I think it's always harder in a film to convey intimacy.
- But I have had the luxury of working on good films with great people.
- The odds of having films made which star women... Everyone still references one movie: 'Bridesmaids!'
- I have to watch the news or my day is not complete.
- If my gravy train stops at SAG, honey, it's been a great ride.
- I always try to approach character first and foremost viscerally.
- And I have a really great agent and I know it's almost an oxymoron to say you have a smart agent. But she is and she has a beautiful aesthetic and she has guided me.
- Holly Hunter has been doing great work forever.
- I'll read a script maybe twice, but I'll think about the role more than I'll rehearse lines.
- Parts that are desexed, matronly - to just put me in a couple of scenes and have me be the older, you know, dead character, is not gonna fly with me.
- These archetypal older women in movies can sometimes make my skin crawl. It's about the one dimension; it's about the lack of any texture.
- The majority of work I do is in independent films, where you're lucky if you have five takes.
- I'm still traumatized that I'm going to be on a big screen in a white bikini and naked so who knows!
- I love writers. All of my best friends are writers.
