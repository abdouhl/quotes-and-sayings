- 'Skeleton Creek' is like nothing you've ever read before because it's a book and a movie at the same time.
- When I was a kid, I used to love it when one of my friends would jump out from behind a door and try to scare me. I always did the same thing in response.
- There are so many ways to tell a story. With multiplatform books, we are reimagining what literacy can be.
- Getting to the point where I was ready to write a book has been about a 20-year journey of being, really honestly, too afraid to try - which I think is pretty common for people who are trying to write a large piece of fiction.
- I travel to a lot of schools, and I see firsthand that while we do still have a lot of traditional readers, we don't have as many as we used to. And we're missing an awful lot of kids entirely... Do I want to get rid of the Internet? Obviously, I don't want that because of all the amazing things it brings.
- My job as an author is to tell the story in the best way possible, to make it flow seamlessly and get the reader to keep turning the page.
- I took English courses in college, but I don't have an English degree. I have a degree in economics.

- Don't get me wrong - I love books! I just think a video has a bigger bang when it comes to a good, old-fashioned adrenaline rush.
- I'm a relic, and things were a lot different when I was fifteen and sixteen. There were no cell phones, no laptops... I learned to type on an actual typewriter.
- There's something really fun about being scared, and I guess that was at least part of why I wanted to film certain scenes from my new book, 'Skeleton Creek.'
- I'm a visual thinker, thrill seeker, and I'm easily distracted. I see everything I'm writing, and I think it naturally affects the pace of things.
- For kids, multitasking electronically is common. But they are totally focused. You can tell a good story, and they listen.
- I wasn't really conscious about 'The 39 Clues' movie when I wrote 'The Black Circle.'
- I remember all the way back in high school thinking about writing books. And, in fact, I've written a lot of stories. I've got dozens of stories I've written that no one's ever seen.
- Yes, we're pretty into books around my house. We have lots and lots of books around. We have TV, but really no one ever watches it.
- They wouldn't let me into Germany from 1998-2000 because I bumped into the chancellor's daughter on my skateboard.
