- I love to go shopping and see what catches my eye.
- My mom always talks about how hard it was to grow up in a political family. It's always split up, and just - I want to have fun in life. No, politics isn't on the list.
- I've always been into dressing nicely. My dad's really into fashion, also. We'll always go out and buy stuff. He has his own style and I have my own style, but it's a shared thing. Same thing with my grandfather; he was really into his style, so it's just sort of been passed down, I think.
- I'm very fortunate to have been raised in my family. I learned early about the importance of giving back.
- Fashion and wearing clothes is a daily routine for everybody. What better way to spread the word of giving back and philanthropic ways of life than to wear something that gives back to charity?
- My grandmother always said, 'when you receive a paycheck, you always have to put a certain amount to your savings, and 10 percent right away to charity.'
- I've wanted to do some sort of acting stuff down the line, but modeling is a good way to get comfortable in front of the camera.
- My mother's nickname for me is 'Positive Patrick.' I like to live up to that title.
- My mom raised me with the idea of doing public service, and I definitely want to go in that direction. But I also want to follow in my dad's entrepreneurial footsteps.
