- As a result of the asthma I was sent to school in the country, and only visited Sydney for brief, violently asthmatic sojourns on my way to a house we owned in the Blue Mountains.
- I continued writing the bad plays which fortunately nobody would produce, just as no one did me the unkindness of publishing my early novels.
