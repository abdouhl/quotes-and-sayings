- When you have a different mother, you want to be in her world. Because in mine, I didn't feel like I fit in.
- Back when I first started with Scandal, I felt like I had to carry a lot of the weight because it was up to me to sell those songs.
- Being a mom was a full-time job. I was never willing to sacrifice everything for my career.

- Scandal rarely toured after those first few hits. I want to go out and sing and connect with fans who may have never seen us live.
- I don't want to bore people with stories about being in rock n' roll and being a mother. Other singers do it. I can, too. I just do what I have to do. It's not that hard. It's just different.

- The more rocking, the better.
- I'm a lead singer of a band, and that's so enough. It's not like I need to have my name on everything. The new name 'Scandal, Featuring Patty Smyth' was just to make it clear that I wasn't leaving the group.
- It's funny. You travel all over the world, and you wind up with a guy from your hometown.
- We shot the video for 'Broken' where both my parents grew up. There was always a strong sense of serving our country in the neighborhood - my father and all my uncles served, and most of them enlisted.
