- Any filmmaker who has translated some personal vision into a film that actually gets shot and distributed is wildly successful. Congratulations! Anything after that is gravy.
- I don't think any of us think of ourselves as artists or actors - clowns, we'll accept that label.

- It's never easy getting an independent film made and distributed - even when it's easy.
