- 'Rosemary's Baby' is a real New York movie, even though you wouldn't necessarily think of it as one, though I do.
- I don't think film actors need training, really, but I needed any help I could get.
- I was a big 'Planet of The Apes' fan, so I was really excited about being in it. I had a really good time. I liked wearing all that stuff, and I liked playing the part.
- I've very critical of myself, and film has been an adjustment for me.
- I never thought I would have any particular career in movies at all.
- You are absolutely free to describe me as a turtle or something.
- I played old men back in drama school. It's just now that I'm drawing level with the age of the characters I play, but I'm fine with that, and I've certainly never envied people who became hugely famous when they were young.
- One of my favourite things growing up was 'Asterix', those books.
- I don't mind being stereotyped in some way and playing certain kinds of guys, but if I can find something to occasionally get a break from that, that would be nice. And I feel like I manage to.
- I wanted to play Zapruder, as he is a man you really don't know much about: a faceless, anonymous figure.
- If I play a more aggressive, stronger guy, I often go through my day feeling a bit better than when I play somebody who's not.
- The 'Planet of the Apes' movies made me wanna - probably unconsciously - be an actor. Seriously. And The Mummy - and 'Hammer horror' movies. 'Fantastic.' I loved stuff like that, and that stuff probably did more than anything to make me wanna do it.
- I try to avoid people as much as possible. They might change my life!
- I definitely had a top-notch education.
- I was the youngest child and got a lot more freedom than my brother and sister. I used to wander, doing my own thing under the radar, but I didn't get in bad, bad trouble.
- I don't feel like I've ever done anything - even 'Big Momma's House' - that I didn't really have some desire to do.
- The supporting thing can be harder to pop in and out of. The hardest thing is the people who have to come in and play, say, the bartender for a day - that's a lot harder than playing the lead role. You have to pop in and get it right. It's a lot of pressure to just pop in there and fit in and find your footing really fast.

- I still want to be the guy who can get on the subway and check out the freak on the subway.
- I think one of the great things about acting is the instant gratification: you just get up and start being a part of the story. The immediacy is something you get really addicted to.
- I always would be happy to make a character even more unlikable, but you know, there's a limit and if you go there, you get into a very different kind of movie, man.
- I don't really have any opinion about my performance in 'Big Momma's House.'
- I mean, I'm not going to play the hero of something.
- Academia is a rarified culture, especially an Ivy League academic background.
- Most conspiracies interest me because of the people who are into them, and the lengths they'll go to expose it or the evidence they think they have. All that stuff. There's just something so beautiful to me about people who sincerely believe we never went to the moon. It gives me so much joy.
- I've never not been proud of the work I was doing; I have nothing I have any shame about.
- As an actor, to have achieved financial stability is amazing. But I always have this weird fear that I'm not going to get any more work; it's about not having enough money.
- It'd be disingenuous to say I don't like attention - I'm an actor for God's sake - and it's flattering and all, but attention was never my big goal. I just like to work and have a good time.
- Lead roles are fun, but I'm especially happy other, more colorful supporting stuff has come along.
- I remember when I was at the first showing of 'John Dies at the End' at Sundance, and I was talking to some of the people in the standby crowd who were outside and didn't have tickets. They were just waiting in line to see if they could get in. It was this whole gang of die-hard sci-fi wacko people, and they were just fantastic.
- I was never the class clown or put on shows at home. I never thought of acting as something I could do with my life. When I was a kid, I used to run around wrapped in toilet paper so I could be the Mummy. But that wasn't a sign that I was dreaming of being an actor. I was just an odd child.
- There is something pleasurable for an actor to produce something and not be in it.
- I was an English major at Yale, but I did do undergraduate theater there. And I went to the graduate school for acting.
- Now, actors get so familiarized with Eastern Europe. I never imagined I'd get as familiar with Budapest and Prague and places like that in my life.

- I don't consider myself a very interesting person. I have the mentality of a supporting actor.
- I did a movie called 'American Splendor', based on the comic book writer Harvey Pekar.
- I really do like a really good science fiction movie and a really good horror movie. Those are the kinds of things I really like. But, I mean, I'm not into sort of like slasher movies. I like a really good science fiction movie, which is hard to do. They don't make many really good ones any more.
- Am I really cool? You're telling me I'm cool? Well, that's good to hear.
- I suppose there must be some way in which I'm compelled to show some side of myself - or of people - that's paranoid and fraught and beleaguered and downtrodden, just as Tom Cruise wants to show that he's terrifyingly upbeat and terrifyingly heroic all the time.
- Am I an anxious guy? I think I have been called upon as an actor a lot to access emotions like that. But I don't really think I am a big worrier. I don't see myself like that. But I guess other people do. Which is maybe worrying in itself.
- The problem with getting injured when you get older is that it takes longer to recover.
- Religion features more now in my life than it did when I was a kid - my dad rejected the Catholic church as a young man. I had no religious upbringing, but certainly, Dad was a kind of secular humanist. I don't know if he was an atheist or agnostic. I regret I didn't talk to him about it.
- Do you know Don Coscarelli? 'Bubba Ho-Tep?' That's one of my favorite movies in the world. And I love the 'Phantasm' movies.
- Well, you know, when people say stuff about you, it's always really flattering. But does it mean anything to me? It's not really real to me; there's no reality to it.
- I don't mind talking about acting. I don't have anything interesting to say about it, but it's interesting talking about it.
- I'm clearly not Brad Pitt, and I'm never going to be Brad Pitt.

- Acting can be a really silly thing. It's like playing dress-up.
- I learned how to fire a sniper rifle, which I'm sure will be useful at some point.
- I worked with J. T. Walsh - it was one of the best experiences I ever had - a fantastic actor and a great guy. I was in the last movie that he did: 'The Negotiator.' He died a couple of months after that. He was great.
- I like playing weird, kind of shady people.
- I've got to be the geekiest guy in the world in a lot of ways. I'm like a zeta male.
- I was more used to acting onstage, for a long time. I don't know, maybe I was temperamentally more suited to stage stuff. And there are things about the stage that I miss in a lot of ways.
- It is because my dad died suddenly that I became an actor. I thought, I'm going to make money doing this thing I enjoy.
- I would probably choose supporting roles if I had to make a choice. It's actually a really hard thing to say. It's all on a role-by-role basis, ultimately. I shouldn't be so quick to say that. I feel like you're given greater license to be colorful and eccentric in supporting roles, and that's interesting to me.
- With 'Duplicity', I was a little bit like, 'This isn't that hard of a movie.' This isn't like some huge brain trust of a movie. You gotta be a little bit awake to follow the plot, but it's really just a kind of light entertainment. It's like those Cary Grant movies, which are not meant to be anything other than diverting. In a nice way.
- In a weird way, I like to find the quirkiness in ordinary things. I like to find what is ordinary in quirky people.
- It's funny: most people who recognize me on the subway and stuff - it's much more they think of me as a funny guy. I get much more of people telling me how much I make them laugh, actually. Which is nice.
- My father died in 1989 before I knew what I was going to do with my life. I had just graduated from college. My mother died just before 'Sideways' came out. She knew I was an actor, but she never saw me become successful.
- I really only started doing film in '97. I mean, before then, I just pretty much did theater.
- Somehow whatever I play ends up being sleazy.
- When I did 'Lady in the Water,' the most exciting thing to me was to get to work with Bob Balaban - I couldn't leave the guy alone. I drove him crazy. He's fantastic and a hilarious guy.
- Sometimes, I think I may be more recognizable because I'm character-looking.
- 'Capricorn One' just seemed like... wow. That was it, y'know? Nothing was ever going to be better than that movie.
- The white male is one of the easiest things to be. There's always a job; there's always something for you to do.
- I want to be a villain with steel hands or something. I want to be the crazy, world-domination-obsessed villain. I would love to be a Bond villain.
- I find that the crazy narcissists, the selfish loons are often the most fun to be around, weirdly.
- This whole business feels kind of intense, like a bad fit. Round peg, square hole. But whatever, I'll take it.
- I consider myself an atheist. My wife is Jewish. And I'm fine with my son being raised as a Jew. He's learning Hebrew and is really into it. I will talk to my own son about my atheism when the time is right. But there's a great tradition of Jewish atheism, there are no better atheists in the world than the Jews.
- I don't think film actors need training, really.
- I get tired of myself pretty fast.
- Honestly, I never wanted to be more than a good supporting actor. Really, I enjoy it.
