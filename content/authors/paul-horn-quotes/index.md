- You have to go out and learn jazz by playing.
- We were the first small American jazz group since Sidney Bechet in 1927 to play for the public in Moscow and Leningrad.
- In 1983, all of us had U.S. passports, but because there was so much tension between America and the U.S.S.R., we were announced as a Canadian group.

- Jazz is a way of life, and you have to learn about it on the street, so to speak. But the training comes in by giving you the tools to work with.
- Even back when I played 'straight-ahead,' I mixed it up. I played some free-form, classical adaptations, solo flute stuff. It was New Age in its own way.
- After I came out of surgery - I was in the hospital for five weeks - I found that I gravitated toward very gentle sounds: chant music, solo bamboo flute sounds, a laid-back record of my own called 'Inside.' And the music became a very real part of my recovery process.
- I'm a romantic. The impressionists have always been my favorites. I like prettiness - beauty, or what I perceive as beauty.
- The enthusiasm, the adulation for us as jazz artists, in Kiev and Odessa was really heartwarming.
