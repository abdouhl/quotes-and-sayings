- My old school in Liverpool is now a performing-arts school, and I kind of teach there - I use the word lightly - but I go there and talk to students.

- I don't take me seriously. If we get some giggles, I don't mind.
- I had this song called Helter Skelter, which is just a ridiculous song. So we did it like that, 'cuz I like noise.
- So, if I'm cooking, I'll be steaming vegetables, making some nice salad, that kind of stuff.
- Why would I retire? Sit at home and watch TV? No thanks. I'd rather be out playing.
- In the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make.
- Buy, buy, says the sign in the shop window; Why, why, says the junk in the yard.
- I can take pot or leave it. I got busted in Japan for it. I was nine days without it and there wasn't a hint of withdrawal, nothing.
- I used to think anyone doing anything weird was weird. Now I know that it is the people that call others weird that are weird.
- I never look forward, because I have no idea about how any of it happened to getting here. I've no idea how the next five years are going to be.
- But you know, as a kid I would have thought of a vegetarian as a wimp.
- I've got to admit it's getting better. It's a little better all the time.
- None of us wanted to be the bass player. In our minds he was the fat guy who always played at the back.
- We were pretty good mates until the Beatles started to split up and Yoko came into it. It was more like old army buddies splitting up on account of wedding bells.

- I hate the idea of success robbing you of your private life.
- I can't deal with the press; I hate all those Beatles questions.
- She is the rock 'n' roll queen. Weirdly enough, that is one of the things her reign will be remembered for. Queen Elizabeth I, we remember Raleigh; Queen Elizabeth II it's gonna be the Beatles.
- At the end of the Beatles, I really was done in for the first time in my life. Until then, I really was a kind of cocky sod.
- You see, my mother was a district nurse until she died when I was 14, and we used to move from time to time because of her work.
- I used to think that all my Wings stuff was second-rate stuff, but I began to meet younger kids, not kids from my Beatle generation, who would say, We really love this song.
- Lyricists play with words.
- With the Beatles, we'd been very spoiled because we had George Martin who worked for the record label we were going to be signed to. That was very fortunate, because we grew together.

- Microphones are just like people, if you shout at them, they get scared.
- It was Elvis who really got me hooked on beat music. When I heard 'Heartbreak Hotel' I thought, this is it.
- There are only four people who knew what the Beatles were about anyway.
- When I sit down to write a song, it's a kind of improvisation, but I formalize it a bit to get it into the studio, and when I step up to a microphone, I have a vague idea of what I'm about to do.
- To keep the record straight, it wasn't always John and Yoko. We've all accused one another of various business things; we tend to be pretty paranoid by now, as you can imagine. There's a lot of money involved.
- I have not practiced how to be a singer without an instrument.
- John's time and effort were, in the main, spent on pretty honorable stuff. As for the other side, well, nobody's perfect, nobody's Jesus. And look what they did to him.

- My so-called career is a haphazard thing.
- George Martin, he's very good at a very sort of lush, sweet arrangement.
- Somebody said to me, 'But the Beatles were anti-materialistic.' That's a huge myth. John and I literally used to sit down and say, 'Now, let's write a swimming pool.'
- It's time to end the cruel slaughter of whales and leave these magnificent creatures alone.
- Being in the audience actually looks like quite a lot of fun.
- I'm the worst on facts about me or facts about the Beatles.
- The Stones also still have a huge following. Mick Jagger leaps around like a crazy dude. And Keith Richards, Ronnie Wood and Charlie Watts are playing great too.

- When you first get money, you buy all these things so no one thinks you're mean, and you spread it around. You get a chauffeur and you find yourself thrown around the back of this car and you think, I was happier when I had my own little car! I could drive myself!
- When we were starting off as kids, just the idea of maybe going to do this as a living instead of getting what we thought was going to be a boring job, was exciting.
- But with writers, there's nothing wrong with melancholy. It's an important color in writing.

- Putting two songs together, I've always loved that trick when it works.
- I'm always writing songs, and I've got a bunch that I want to record.
- I definitely did look up to John. We all looked up to John. He was older and he was very much the leader; he was the quickest wit and the smartest.
- I love the past. There are parts of the past I hate, of course.
- I think people who create and write, it actually does flow-just flows from into their head, into their hand, and they write it down. It's simple.
- I'm not religious, but I'm very spiritual.
- Somewhere down the line everyone must pay for their misdeeds.
- I'm often reading a magazine and hearing about someone's new record, and I think, 'Oh, boy, that's gonna be better than me.' It's a very common thing.
- George wrote Taxman, and I played guitar on it. He wrote it in anger at finding out what the taxman did. He had never known before then what could happen to your money.
- I was still 15 when I met John Lennon at a village fete in Woolton, in Liverpool.
- Think globally, act locally.

- I like the idea that people hear my stuff, and if it's commercially successful, that's a good sign that it's being heard.
- I never really got on that well with Yoko anyway. Strangely enough, I only started to get to know her after John's death.
- Nothing pleases me more than to go into a room and come out with a piece of music.
- I don't ever try to make a serious social comment.
- I feel that if I said anything about John, I would have to sit here for five days and say it all. Or I don't want to say anything.
- Someone like John would want to end the Beatle period and start the Yoko period. He wouldn't like either to interfere with the other.
- Looking back, I think I was always musical. My dad was very musical, and I think my mom was musical.
- If slaughterhouses had glass walls, everyone would be a vegetarian.
- Love is all you need.
- I think I always had a musicality, and I think I could tell a good song from a bad song. And I would appreciate hearing something that was new to me.
- I used to think that anyone doing anything weird was weird. I suddenly realized that anyone doing anything weird wasn't weird at all and it was the people saying they were weird that were weird.
