- 'Shooting Star' started out as the arrangement on the record, and it's developed into a real audience-participation song, just from playing it.
- One overindulges when you're younger, and you pay the price in later years. But I always realized how important it was for me to take care of myself and my voice if I was gonna have a voice when I was older.
- I have a lot of analog. I think a lot of people do. There are a lot of people that are re-discovering it. I still have a lot of my old records from back in the day. It's a joy to play things like Junior Wells' 'Hoodoo Man Blues,' and John Mayall & The Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton. There's a warmth that you can still feel.
- Once I'd become a songwriter, it just stays with you. You always want to write more songs because it's such a great feeling.
- 'That's How Strong My Love Is' carries a message that resonates with the broken-hearted, and most of us have been there.
- Life is so mundane, isn't it? It's great to hear a guitarist getting into it and the rhythmic section blasting, even if it's all meaningless.
- I didn't really like the '80s, to be honest with you. There was some good music that came out, but it went a bit disco for me.
- I saw The Jeff Beck Group at the Marquee Club in 1967, when he was with Rod Stewart, and holy smokes, they were amazing.

- When I went down to London in '67, I had three things in mind: To survive, to find peace of mind, and to make music doing it.
- I am proud to be a Canuck.
- When Free came together, there was a creative magic around us, something unique and different.
- The simpler the message, the broader the meaning, in many respects. I think about a song like Free's 'All Right Now,' which I'm often asked about. It's that sort of song.
- There is magic on earth.
- I got the idea of meditation from The Beatles. It was a fad, but I've found it beneficial in my crazy life.
- Horses are such a powerful part of human development and have been since the early ages. We humans owe them so much.
- I always think the audience should be part of the show.
- A song like 'Shooting Star' - the thought process behind writing that song was that I looked around and thought, 'Wow, there's a lot of people dying at that time in the music business.'
- Nobody should attempt to do Freddie Mercury impressions.
- I met Paul Kossoff for the first time when I was playing in the back of a pub room in Finsbury Park in London in 1967. It was kind of a blues thing going on, and he came up and said, 'I'd like to have a jam.' So he came up and jammed with me, and I just loved his playing right from the start.
- I honestly have really deep reservations about releasing everything you ever did. Every time somebody farted in the studio, now it's out there.
- I don't like lyrics to be overbearing. I like them to say something. But I'm not trying to change the world overnight. Something simple and understandable that people can relate their own everyday experiences to.
- 'When I'm Sixty-Four' hasn't worn well, but George Harrison's 'Within You Without You' is awesome.

- You've had all that punk and New Wave thing, and I think people have really got sick up to here with it. I know I have.
- My mother said I used to dance to all this radio music when I was a young kid.
- When I first started writing songs, I looked around at the bands that were making it, and they all had the original material. Jimi Hendrix, the Beatles, the Stones - everybody was writing their own songs. That's the way that you established your own identity.
- When I was 14, I heard Otis Redding in a club local to me, and I was blown away. It leaped out at me and went straight to my heart. I set my sights on singing like that.
- We come from a generation where the music was very innovative, a lot of it coming out of blues and influenced by blues: the idea was that you would jam on things, and you'd try things out. You took a journey, and you took a left turn, and you experimented live right there in the moment.
- Only Freddie Mercury could do Freddie Mercury. He was absolutely brilliant - I loved him to pieces, and I had a great deal of respect for him.
- Free - I miss that band, but when I look back, we were very young.
- A lot of those early blues records and soul records were pretty much live. It was what it was, and they had goofs and mistakes, but it still kept its charm. We have to remember to keep the feel. It's so important.
- I got the idea of what a band should be from listening to Booker T and Otis Redding.

- Ann Wilson has an amazing voice and is a brilliant songwriter.
- Free got famous fast, and it was a shock. You're working towards it, and when you suddenly get it with bells on, it is a bit much. I don't know how well I dealt with it.
- I enjoyed playing with the guys in Free Spirit so much because they really dug into Free material, and I really liked how they expressed it. They have a lot of dynamics.
- I just try to keep an open mind, and that's the way a lot of good things happen.
- You go through periods of times where bands are calling the shots, and then sometimes, you've got the record companies calling the shots. I think it has to be a bit of both to make the thing work.
- My dad worked on the Middlesbrough docks.
- I loved the 'Free Spirit' tour and the guys who helped create the magic: Pete Bullick, Rich Newman, Ian Rowley and Gerard 'G' Louis.
- As a performer, the thing that I love is to see people come together.
- Without music in schools' curriculum, there is a void for young people to express, explore, and experience music.
- I was brought up in a fairly emotionally repressed kind of society in Northeast England where one didn't express emotions and was expected to keep a stiff upper lip.
- A song isn't finished until it's played live, and then it moves on.
- With Free, we had phased out all of the blues material and wanted to phase in all original material, and the only song that stayed from our blues past was 'The Hunter' by Albert King. People just loved that. And I said, 'We have to write a song that will top that - otherwise, what are we doing here?' That was the birth of 'All Right Now.'
- There are just so many people making music out there. I've always promoted the idea that everybody needs to make music. I think the more music there is in the world, the better, but it does make it highly competitive.
- I love it when people come from all over the place in separate vehicles, and they all come to this venue and become one energy. When that happens, it's a very magical thing. I think that helps the world go around, and it's what we do as performers - bring people together.
- I just sort of grew up with music always in the background like a soundtrack. And it really hit me hard when The Beatles came along, like so many people. That got me started digging back further to Chuck Berry.
- One doesn't have to sit through exams and go to universities to play rock n' roll.
- I have a secret weapon. My wife Cynthia is very good at keeping me in shape. She's very good for me. She's the best thing that happened to me.
- The one thing I loved about blues and soul was the way they taught the world how to express such deep feelings.
- In Free, we managed ourselves, and it was too tough for us to handle all of what that entailed when we got to touring America.
- When I left Free back in 1972, I didn't play 'All Right Now' until about 1996, when I was touring with Jason Bonham, and we were supporting the tribute record we had done to Muddy Waters.
- I come from a working-class family of seven children.
- I get a bit quick-tempered sometimes.
- Music takes me where I go. I'm always open to wherever the journey will take me.
- I like to be in control of my own destiny.
- I was 17, and it was my first summer in London as a professional singer. One hot, humid evening, I heard that the Jimi Hendrix Experience was playing in a blues club above a pub in Finsbury Park. I was flat broke and couldn't afford a ticket, so I went along just to stand outside and listen.
- Otis Redding, his voice, there was something spiritual and unworldly and at the same time, very deeply connected with the human connection and the way one feels about life in general, love, life, and everything, really.
- If not for music in my life as a young person, who knows where I would have focused my energy.
- I liked the 12-bar blues because everybody could play it, but they could also play it their own way, and they could express their own emotions using that as a structure.
- I look at John Lee Hooker and Muddy Waters, guys who had a fantastic longevity, and I learned something from them. They didn't try to sell records. They weren't saying, 'Ok, what can I write, what can I do in the studio that will sell?' They were just doing their thing, and people picked up on it. I like the idea of that.
- I toured with Lynyrd Skynyrd as a solo artist, many years ago. I love those guys.
- I like following whatever's right for me at any given time. I could have stayed with Free for 40 years, but it becomes a corporate entity after a while, and once I become locked into it and governed by it and am expected to do a certain thing all of the time, I tend to want to move on.
- If you look at my history, my history is that of forming bands rather than joining them.
- I tend to want to form bands and then create new music within them. Queen was an exception, and we joined forces because it just seemed to work when we played together.
- When you can touch the spirit, whatever that is, and when you can feel the love, and you can feel the song is cooking and it's in the pocket, you know, everybody knows that's the one that's grooving.
- Songs do write themselves through you; I know people find it hard to believe, but it's true.
- I had a band when I was 14, and we would play around in my hometown of Middlesbrough, and we'd go to the club afterwards, which was the Purple Onion then. There would be live bands playing, and in between that, the DJ would be playing records.
- I'm a big fan of Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac.
- One of my dreams was always to have a piano - a room with a piano overlooking the ocean or a lake.
- When I play solo, that's when I put it all together. I go through all of the songs that I've written wtih all of the different bands; that, for me, tells its own story, and the DVDs really enforce that.
- Every day, every time I sing, I feel blessed, really, to be able to do that. It's like having wings, in a way. It's a bit like flying sometimes, because you go off into another realm. And a whole lot of people come with you. It's amazing.
- Live music is where you get the inspiration and the creativity.
- I look back on the early days of Free with Paul Kossoff with the most fondness of any of my bands, because I met him at a time when I was in London and very hungry, and we believed in each other.
- There's a lot of trickery that can go on in the studio, and there's a lot that one can do - none of which I am interested in even slightly. I mean, you can actually tune vocals and stuff like that, but it's so hideous, I can't believe it.
- Artists like Otis Redding, Sam & Dave, Albert King, Ann Peebles, Isaac Hayes, and so many more gave me hope when I was an angst-filled teenager trying to make sense of it all... They were my teachers. Through their music, I learned how to live, how to be true to myself, and how to tell my story as a songwriter the way that I was feeling it.
- There are so many challenges and different parts to the job of singing. When you're in the studio, you have to be really, really, precise. You've got to keep everything clean and nice because that's going to be something that's down forever. And then you go onstage, and it's much more in the moment.
- I've always been a Jeff Beck fan. Who isn't? He is in a league of his own.
- With Free, we were teenagers, and, ummm, there was a lot of raging hormones.
- Soul and blues were a definite influence on me. It was raw and naked emotion which you didn't get much where I come from.
- The first record I bought was actually Booker T and the MG's 'Red Beans and Rice.'
- I carry my own tea, food, and Tabasco on the plane with me.
- It's important to me to be able to hit the notes and just be able to fly when I sing.
- Of course I was a fan when I was a kid. That's what made me get into it, the whole rock n' roll fantasy.
- I got the idea for the song 'Bad Company' when I saw a poster for the Jeff Bridges movie, and it reminded of an old Victorian picture that I'd once seen, and it said, 'Beware of bad company.' So I sat down at the piano and started to write the song.
- There were personality clashes in Free, really. I think it's as simple as that; I think we felt we weren't leaving each other enough room to develop in our own way, and we were restricting each other. So we said, let's go different ways.
- I've been influenced by so many great people , like Sam Moore, Wilson Pickett, Otis Redding, John Lee Hooker, B.B. King, so many great blues and soul artists that I completely revere. So it's strange for me, actually, to hear somebody say, 'Oh, I was deeply influenced by your music.'
- When we formed Bad Company, I looked around and asked, 'Who is the biggest rock band in the world?' The answer was undoubtedly Led Zeppelin. Peter Grant was their manager, so we got him to work with us. That made the difference for Bad Company.
- I didn't 'join' Queen. We played together and found a strong connection, did a TV show, and carried on - then I suddenly realised I'd been with these guys for four years. If I'd been called up and asked to join, I would have said no.
