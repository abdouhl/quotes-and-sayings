- I get like a melody that comes up and I try to write it down or record it. Hum it into a tape recorder or write it down on some manuscript paper. It could happen at any time, on the road or off the road, but mostly, you know, at home.
- I don't really think about dance except just before rehearsals start. I put it off. I don't live my life thinking about dance.
- Now my main goal is my solo career, so I want to keep doing that.
- I want to lift the audience to the miraculous in human nature. After all, we shouldn't be here, with all the odds against us in nature. It's kind of unusual and wonderful!
- I want to build a studio in my backyard. The interest rates are low now, so who knows.
- I like to do cover songs if I really love them, I have to love the song first.
- I grew up in Denver, Colorado. After high school I went to Vegas.
- I know I can't do everything myself. So I know I specialize in my melodies and I do some of my demo work. I pass it on to my producers who are much better at the production level.
- My sound is very smooth. Not to be to cliche, but really sensual and sultry.
- A lot of people are doing something about their weight, but by their own reckoning, it isn't enough to get the results they want.
- By the end of it, you never know how it's going to turn out. Hopefully if I pick the right songs and put the right melodies on it and all the collaboration works out. it's a win-win situation.
