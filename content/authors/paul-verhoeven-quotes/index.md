- I had decided after 'Hollow Man' to stay away from science fiction. I felt I had done so much science fiction. Four of the six movies I made in Hollywood are science-fiction oriented, and even 'Basic Instinct' is kind of science fiction.
- I had become a film director because I thought I could express something in an artful way.
- Science fiction is about worlds you don't know and worlds you can create, like in 'Avatar'.
- Jesus was a human being, bound by history and the natural world; an extraordinary man, to be sure, but still a man.
- My first film was a comedy, but after that I went always into more heavier stuff.
- Jesus may have had an immense sense of importance or destiny, but he never claimed to be the Son of God.
