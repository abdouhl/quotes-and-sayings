- Love is something that is very personal to each individual based on where they are in their lives. It fluctuates and changes over time.

- With all due respect to 'The Vampire Diaries,' doing the same thing, over and over again, for essentially five years straight, it really becomes laborious and tedious, and it becomes a job.

- I'm very close with my mom.
