- I'm first and foremost a writer. I followed my personal legend, my childhood dream of becoming a writer, but I can't say why I'm one.
- When I'm dancing, I'm not thinking about anything. I am here. I am totally there. You know? And the feeling is a sensation of being away from myself. My soul dances with the angels, and my body dances with my wife.
- MySpace is an addiction.
- No, I never saw an angel, but it is irrelevant whether I saw one or not. I feel their presence around me.
- You drown not by falling into a river, but by staying submerged in it.
- This may sound a little bit idealistic, but when I go to my blog, my Facebook page, my Twitter account, I talk to different people from all over the world, and you see how it's easy to establish a dialogue.
- The major religions, Christianity, Judaism, Islam, they deny somehow that God has a feminine face. However, if you go to the holy texts, you see there is this feminine presence.
- I don't set out to write about spirituality; I am free to do something different every time.
- I am a Catholic, not so committed to the church, but to the idea of the Virgin, the female face of God.
- Writing is a solitary experience. I'm extremely superstitious. If I talk about the book or name the title out loud before finishing, I feel the energy I need to write will be drained. It's so intimate, I can't even share it with my wife.
- You're always learning. The problem is, sometimes you stop and think you understand the world. This is not correct. The world is always moving. You never reach the point you can stop making an effort.
- I've done everything I wanted to do, even if I have had to pay a very high price - which has been the case most of the time.
- Publishers see free downloads as threatening the sales of the book.
- I write from my soul. This is the reason that critics don't hurt me, because it is me. If it was not me, if I was pretending to be someone else, then this could unbalance my world, but I know who I am.
- We want to answer this classical question, who am I? So I think that most of our works are for art, or whatever we do, including science or religion, tried to answer that question.
- In the United States, I am a great success, but I am not a celebrity.
- No one can lie, no one can hide anything, when he looks directly into someone's eyes.
- Remember your dreams and fight for them. You must know what you want from life. There is just one thing that makes your dream become impossible: the fear of failure.

- Be brave. Take risks. Nothing can substitute experience.
- We have to stop and be humble enough to understand that there is something called mystery.

- I can control my destiny, but not my fate. Destiny means there are opportunities to turn right or left, but fate is a one-way street. I believe we all have the choice as to whether we fulfil our destiny, but our fate is sealed.
- Beauty is the greatest seducer of man.
- Physical elegance, which is what I am talking about here, comes from the body. This is no superficial matter, but rather the way that man found to honour the way he places his two feet on the ground.

- When you write an article about anything, trolls use the comments to attack. They feel frustrated - but haters are losers. It's not good to feed this aspect. It's more intelligent to be constructive.
- I am not a self-help writer. I am a self-problem writer. When people read my books, I provoke some things. I cannot justify my work. I do my work; it is up to them to classify it, to judge.

- Things do not always happen the way I would like them to happen, and I had better get used to that.

- The more in harmony with yourself you are, the more joyful you are and the more faithful you are. Faith is not to disconnect you from reality - it connects you to reality.
- I talk to my readers on social networking sites, but I never tell them what the book is about. Writing is lonely, so from time to time I talk to them on the Internet. It's like chatting at a bar without leaving your office. I talk with them about a lot of things other than my books.

- The more violent the storm, the quicker it passes.
- I'm not a person that socializes very well.
- I love almost everything about my work except conferences. I am too shy in front of an audience. But I love signings and having eye contact with a reader who already knows my soul.
- Waiting is painful. Forgetting is painful. But not knowing which to do is the worse kind of suffering.
- Of course, to have money is just great because you can do what you think is important to you. I always was a rich person because money's not related to happiness.

- I believe enlightenment or revelation comes in daily life. I look for joy, the peace of action. You need action. I'd have stopped writing years ago if it were for the money.
- I can't consciously explain how people feel after reading my books. All is too personal.

- The gigantic tension before the shooting of an arrow, and the total relaxation seconds later, is my way of connecting to the universe.

- Elegance is usually confused with superficiality, fashion, lack of depth. This is a serious mistake: human beings need to have elegance in their actions and in their posture because this word is synonymous with good taste, amiability, equilibrium and harmony.
