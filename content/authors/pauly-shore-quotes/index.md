- In my 30s, it wasn't cool to like Pauly Shore movies. It was cool to like them when they came out, then it wasn't cool.
- Death isn't a funny thing. We're all lucky to be living.
- I'm not used to getting good reviews.
- The best part about stand-up is that you control everything. Period. When you work in movies, or on TV shows, there are 50 other people involved.
- I want to show all sides of myself. I mean, I don't want to howl at the moon my whole life, you know?
- When you put yourself out into the world and say, 'Hey, look at me,' you're going to get criticized.
- I never made the movies for the critics; I've done the best I could with the material and the directors and the actors I had. But the thing that's really exciting is that once I do that one project that's different, that stands out, everyone's gonna be watching.
- That's the biggest rule in Hollywood: Don't spend your own money.
- It's in my blood to tour. It's in my blood to get on the road. It's in my blood to go onstage.
- When you work in movies, or on TV shows, there are 50 other people involved. And it's hard, man. They brainwash you to think you're doing the right thing.
- My 20s were a time where I made it; my 30s were when I was away, confused, and trying to figure it all out.
- The best comedy to me - and again, I grew up with comedy since I was a baby, so I've seen it all - is when you exaggerate the truth, like Richard Pryor did, you understand?

- I'm into politics - I'm interested in the election and how pissed off people get.
- I think the best comedy comes from stuff that's based in reality.
- Comedy wasn't something I chose - it chose me.
- The best part about stand-up is that you control everything. Period.
- When you deal with a comedian who has a specific act, you can't hold 'em back. You got to work with 'em, dude. What you think, I'm just gonna do what's on the page, say 'yes sir, no sir'? I'm creatively beyond that.
- I giggle when I put myself down. It's just funny to me.
- Serious and intense people, they drain you. But someone who's an idiot, like myself, they're fun. You either hate me or you love me.
- I'm Jewish. I've always had a thing where it's okay to dance with the devil, just don't become the devil. Even at my peak, I never went too over the top.
- I really don't go out every night to red-carpet events.
- 'Entourage' is a staple L.A.-based show, and people say it's pretty real, and I thought it was. It's an exaggeration of the truth.
- I fly around with chicks on each arm and have no script. I just talk about what I feel like. But that's why my act works: I'm like this normal guy.

- Everywhere I go, people know who I am.
- Even at my peak, I never went too over the top.

- I don't think any of us would be who we are if our parents weren't who they were. People that are in show business, and their parents are not in show business, their parents probably motivated them to get in show business.
- My mom and dad are both in stand-up comedy, so that's where I started, that's where I got everything. My roots are holding the mic.

- I think you gotta look at stuff half-full as opposed to half-empty.

- We all have a past; it's just that my past is out there for all to see.
- The public was used to a Pauly Shore film coming out every year or two, you understand? So when that went away, the public lost familiarity with me.
- Whenever someone dies everyone says, I love that guy, except for Jeffrey Dahmer.

- I miss working with great actors, working with great directors.
- Few if any teenagers can relate to getting up for school and finding famous comics like Pryor and Williams hanging out in your living room after a hard night of partying. But that's Hollywood.
