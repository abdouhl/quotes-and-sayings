- While wedged in the middle of a transparent rubber ring at a Dubai water park, I couldn't help but notice that I appeared to have grown my own rubber ring around my midriff.
- I happily went on holiday with my parents until I was 18, because we always had such a good time that I didn't want to venture off and do my own thing. I have very fond memories of those holidays with my brother, mum, and dad.
- You always have to make sure your husband knows he isn't going to be replaced.
- I'm a pretty organised traveller.
- I was bullied from the age of 11 onwards. I was always much bigger than the other kids. I spoke nicely, didn't swear, and I refused to try to fit in and be like everyone else. People assumed I thought I was above everyone else.
- Manners are really very important to me.
- I wouldn't like to say that I spend most of my time on holiday, but I have done a lot of traveling and have been to a lot of places.
- I'm lucky that I have a supportive partner who loves me when I'm bigger as well as slim.
- There are so many places I have visited which are unusual, but the ones my family and I tend to always go back to are those in Europe, particularly France and Italy.
- There's certainly never a dull moment in the Stewart clan.
- Rod's always been a keen sportsman, so he didn't live as excessive a life as some musicians.
- I got the best of Rod. And I am fully aware that, even though I love listening to his stories of the crazy days, no relationship could really last then. I sometimes wish I could go back in time to the 1970s or 1980s, sit at a bar, and observe him, but I'm glad our time came when it did.
- I like the idea of going to see the ice caps and the polar bears, because who knows how long they are going to be around for?
- Rod always dresses for dinner - even if I just want to wear tracksuit bottoms, he dresses up.
- Rod's always opening doors for me, but I usually tell him to walk through first. Otherwise, if we're at a restaurant and I'm in front, the paparazzi end up getting a big giant close-up of me, and then he's trailing behind, looking like my little child!
- I do love fish, and I thought it was healthy without understanding the high mercury levels that fish like tuna, swordfish and halibut can contain.
- I think there's always interest in how the other half live - I see myself as a down-to-earth Essex mum who just happens to be living this very glamorous life in Beverly Hills.
- As parents, it is our responsibility to show by example and educate our children on the importance of caring for our planet.
- If I had a partner who asked when I was going to the gym or commented that I was eating too much or asked if I really needed an extra potato, that would make me feel awful. It would be terrible.
- I really do believe that being naturally beautiful is what is inside and what shines through.
- I used to be very into fitness and would happily pose for photos in my bikini. Now I look at those and think, 'Where did that body go?' But that was before children.
- The truth is I'm a very traditional woman, and Rod - despite everything people may think - is a very traditional man. It's true he absolutely loves glamour, and he hasn't got a conventional job, but performing aside, he's happiest at home with his kids around him or lounging in front of the fire watching a war documentary like 'D-Day Remembered.'
- I used to get called Lady Penelope at school because the other kids thought I spoke nicely.
- As long as you try your best, that is all that matters. You don't have to be the fastest runner or top of the class.
- Rod and I believe that it's our duty to set an example, which means teaching our children to treat others as they would wish to be treated.

- Rod and I are living a very charmed and fortunate life, and I wouldn't change it for the world.
- I do look after everyone around me; that's just who I am. I am a real mother hen.
- There's less pressure to look good as you get older.
- I modelled in my 20s, and it was an obsessive time. I was under pressure to look a certain way.
- People often say that if you have to work hard at a marriage, then it's not naturally good, but I think that's totally wrong.
- Rod's not very good at confrontations; he would rather walk away and avoid something rather than go into it.
- Rod and I are naturally in love, and that is what binds us together. But to keep the spark alive in your relationship, you really have to work at it.
- Whenever Rod has four of five days off, he'll be bouncing off the walls with boredom.
