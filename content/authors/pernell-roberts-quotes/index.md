- The number one show on television should be the most informative, educational and exciting show. 'Bonanza' is not that show.
- I wanted to work strictly as a freelance actor, and that's the way it turned out.
- I take parts when I feel like it.
- Stuck as Adam Cartwright, I was only able to use about one-tenth of my ability.
- I don't have a battery of agents to surround me in a cocoon.
- When I finish a movie, I get in my camper and drive around the country.
- When money becomes more important than any other standard, then we're all in trouble.
- I was so unhappy during the last months on 'Bonanza' I was really neurotic. I was anti-social.
- I've worked a lot in Europe, particularly Spain, which I like very much.
- As we get older, we become more political in terms of survival. We realize a certain amount of cunning is necessary and that you just end up a victim when you are totally honest in an environment where those around you arent. It's a matter of remaining true to yourself while continuing to move forward.
- If you're locked into a philosophy of nickels and dimes, then you have a pretty limited approach to life. I don't need a lot of money to live with dignity.
- Money isn't that important to me. My needs are primarily artistic. Mainly I'm interested in my own peace of mind, in knowing who I am and what I am.
- I feel I am an aristocrat in my field of endeavor. My being part of 'Bonanza' was like Isaac Stern sitting in with Lawrence Welk.

- I work when, and where I want to.
- How much does one person need to live? I've never needed or wanted that much.

- As you decline in years, you decline in the marketplace.
- I didn't leave 'Bonanza' in pursuit of any particular goal. I left for my own good.
- There has been an obvious effort to play it safe, to make 'Bonanza' a good family show that would offend no one and hit a consistent level of mediocrity.
- Materialism isn't the panacea that so many people think it is.
- Money Isn't that important to me.
- I've never been career-oriented. Did I ever want to be a star? What's a star? Is that something in the heavens? That's the only definition that comes to my mind. And the most important goals in my life have been to move gently, to be at ease with the mystery of what it's all about.
- I am living with my limitations and have no intention of becoming a writer.
- For a long time after I left 'Bonanza,' I was considered too independent. That meant I got the rejects other actors could afford turning down. I did theater which I loved, but it cannot pay the bills.
- You don't have to have the capitalistic profit motive philosophy.
- My problems with 'Bonanza' were problems of communication. What we discussed would be, never was. I thought it would be a sophisticated show. Instead it never went beyond the comic strip level.
