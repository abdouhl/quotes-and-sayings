- I have a big cynical side to me.
- Jen Lawrence is quite a fan of 'Game of Thrones.'
- I was opposed to doing TV for a long time because I thought the quality of writing wasn't very strong, as opposed to film, but there's been a shift in term of the quality of scripts. HBO has attracted a tremendous amount of great writing talent.
- We're not environmentally doing very good things to this planet, and we might not be around too long.

- The greatest preparation for a TV show is to already have one season behind you.
- I think a lot of great male comic actors are introspective, quiet personalities, which I really admire. But they are really able to turn it up when the camera's on.

- I think 'No' is a very powerful word in our business that is very hard to use early on in your career. But I also think I was pretty arrogant when I was younger... I used that word maybe too much, but it did help me with finding roles that I did like.
- We, as Americans, at least - I mean, I love my country - but we're so self-righteous sometimes, in terms of, like, our nationality, our country. But we're people from somewhere else; the true 'Americans' are the original peoples. It's funny, but we're a very territorial species.
- That's one of the things about theater vs. film - with theater, actors have a little more control, and one of the disappointing things about films is that once you're done shooting, anything can happen, you know?

- 'Star Wars' or 'The Lord of the Rings' deal with great big Joseph Campbell-style myths, good and evil.

- I never lived in an abandoned railroad station.
- The leads are often the boring part.
- It's amazing what they can do with animation nowadays. It's really beautiful. The 3D stuff is out of hand.
- My favourite superhero? I have a soft spot for Batman, because he doesn't have any super powers - he's just a person. And he's pretty dark.

- I have a friend - not a dwarf - who's an alchemist of sorts. He concocted a men's cologne... He gave me a bottle as a gift. I was thinking we should totally put this on the market. You know how Jessica Simpson and Beyonce have signature perfumes and make a mint? I'm thinking this cologne could be my ticket to fortune.

- Friends don't care about issues like dwarf tossing.
- Sometimes on sets, I shut down, try to focus.
- 'Game of Thrones' is an amazing show, and I have no problem speaking of the virtues of HBO.

- I feel like life is much greater than a hero or a villain: there's good people that sometimes make mistakes.
- Maybe in my 20s I was a little more lively. But I'm done with that.
- You'd be surprised how condescending people can be.
- People's personalities get tweaked at weddings.
- If I was born 400 years ago instead of now, I wouldn't have the life I have. There were freak shows, and there was horrible discrimination.
- With a lot of shows, what you'll see happen is they start off really well, and they're very original, but they become sort of a version of themselves. They stand outside the show... they become a cliche of the show they once were. That's the whole 'jumping the shark' thing.

- Anybody who was in 'The Godfather' is a tough guy.
- I've felt like an outsider. I've had to struggle.
- I guess the word to call me is my name, Pete.
- I dress and eat like a fifth-grader, basically. I like sandwiches and cereal and hooded sweatshirts.

- I was born in 1969, believe it or not, so I was a child in the '70s.
- It's a shame how a lot of actors use theater as a stepping stone to film and television work; I think it shouldn't be treated that way. Maybe it's narcissism or something. I think we should always go back to it. I try and do a play a year, and I think that's really helped me.
- I often don't see what I've done, or I cringe when I watch myself.
- Dwarves are still the butt of jokes. It's one of the last bastions of acceptable prejudice.
- It was hard doing scenes with Bobby Cannavale because I would break up laughing because he's so funny.
- I think more money can be very detrimental to movies and TV because things get solved economically rather than creatively, and that's never a good solution.

- There are wars being fought! Who cares what I'm doing on a Saturday night? I'm not even a celebrity.
- I'm a private person in many ways.
- I never was a big comic book fan. Obviously I'd heard them growing up from my friends who did read them, but I never was a big comic book reader.
- I was a sullen kid who smoked cigarettes and wore black every day, and I went to a school that was lacrosse players and Izods.
- I think actors get too comfortable. I like being uncomfortable as an actor because it keeps you alive. I don't know, I think it's important.
- I don't socialize. I'm kind of a hermit. The life of an actor can be very lonely.
- I think if actors are successful at one thing, they paint themselves into a corner sometimes, and what's the fun in that?
- Writing is getting killed by too many chefs. Back in the Bogart days, it started with great scripts. You had a writer, and he wrote a script, and that was your movie. I think that's been watered down a bit lately.
- I think my mom drove by a nuclear power plant when she was pregnant. But I wouldn't be in 'The Station Agent' if she hadn't.

- I like the busted-nose look. I think it's a good look for me.
- I'm not going to play my violin, but with my dwarfism, I'm a bit of a mutant.
- I love working with the same actors repeatedly. That happens a lot. It's kind of inevitable, especially if you work with the same writers and directors and you start to form a company of actors. You gravitate towards each other.
- There are a lot of directors out there who are very specific, visual craftsmen, and while I have the utmost respect for that, they don't really communicate with the actors.
- They'll say, 'Oh, he's sexy,' but women still go for guys who are 6ft 2 ins. I don't believe any of it for a minute.
- Even 'Lord of the Rings' had dwarf-tossing jokes in it. It's like, 'Really?'
- So I won't say I'm lucky. I'm fortunate enough to find or attract very talented people. For some reason I found them, and they found me.
- There's a thing at the Museum of Natural History in New York, where I live: they have a stairwell where you follow the beginning and the course of this planet, and it's a very long stairwell, and you follow, and you follow, and then you reach the top, and we're, like, half a step on the stairwell - the timeline for us on this planet.
- I'm on 'Game Of Thrones,' and every time we have someone new coming on our show, we welcome them with open arms and get revitalised by this new presence. Then we kill them off very quickly.

- I'm recognized, let me put it that way.
- Being on television, playing the same character for many years, for me, I think that would get a little tedious.

- I never know where women are coming from.
- I was fortunate enough to have an upbringing that made me more accepting of who I am.
- I spend my nights just sitting and reading a book and drinking my tea and walking my dog. That's about as exciting as my life gets.
- Any swagger is just defense. When you're reminded so much of who you are by people - not a fame thing, but with my size, constantly, growing up - you just either curl up in a corner in the dark or you wear it proudly, like armor or something. You can turn it on its head and use it yourself before anybody else gets a chance.
- I don't like people being cautious and tentative and choosing their words carefully around me because I'm a dwarf.
- I was once part of a Christmas cabaret. I sang 'I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus.' I tap-danced. I had a ten-gallon hat. It was quite absurd.
- Each year, billions of animals are subjected to cruelty on factory farms, feed lots, and slaughterhouses. The brutality that these animals endure would be grounds for felony cruelty charges if inflicted upon our cats and dogs.
- I feel as much of a stud as... I can't come up with a metaphor. That's how lacking in studliness I am.
- It is hard working with animals, I've got to say.
- I just don't like boring myself. That's one of the main reasons I did 'Ice Age' - because I'd never done something like this before.
- 'Lassie' was amazing. I didn't have any scenes with humans. There's a couple little bits, here or there, but mainly just me and my horse and a couple of dogs in the Isle of Man.
- Will Ferrell is just about the nicest guy - anyone can tell you that.
- My brother, who's a violinist now, was the real ham, the real performer of the family. His passion for the violin is the only thing that kept him from being an actor.
- Fantasy novels, I don't really gravitate to that part of the bookstore.
- I think successful movies that are based on books are their own thing. I think if you're too faithful, word by word, character trait to character trait, it can hurt the movie.
- I have a need to always make people laugh. I have a desperate need. I love a great sense of humor. The people I sort of surround myself with have that.
- I have a friend who says, 'The world doesn't need another angry dwarf!'
- Every person my size has a different life, a different history. Different ways of dealing with it. Just because I'm seemingly O.K. with it, I can't preach how to be O.K. with it. I don't think I still am O.K. with it. There's days when I'm not.
- Sometimes, when the material is really good, you put expectations on yourself to make it the best possible show. You're not just serving up the regular hash and doing your job and going home.
- I do not fault anyone else who makes choices to play characters that they wished they hadn't... Because at the end of the day, none of us are happy with our jobs all the time.
- When people are infected by my charm, they don't see my size. My piercing deep blue eyes are distracting.
