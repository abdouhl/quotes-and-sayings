- I've always been an outsider. Even in London. If I returned to Scotland, I'd feel a complete foreigner.
- It's not about perfection. What's a perfect painting? What's interesting about a perfect painting?
- I would never finish a painting if I didn't have a deadline.
- I do feel Scottish in some way. Maybe it's to do with visiting my grandparents here every summer as a child, but I am aware of my Scottish ancestry. It's there all right, but it would be pushing it to label me a Scottish painter. Or, indeed, an anywhere painter.
- What is bad painting? Picabia made some deliberately bad paintings, but they were by him, so great in a way.
- Painting becomes interesting when it becomes timeless.
- If you are someone like Jeff Koons, and you have to work out how to make a big chrome heart or something, then there are lots of people and a big production involved. The money is more natural somehow. For me, I am just on my own in the studio, trying to make things work. One thing is sure: it doesn't make painting any easier.
- I love Trinidad and I love living there, but it's quite harsh.
- It's still an escape for me, painting, so it also takes me elsewhere. I don't think I would do it otherwise.
- You cannot just be working in a vast, air-conditioned loft space and think you are going to make a decent painting. Francis Bacon had a special studio built, and he felt completely emasculated in there. I have to be somewhere comfortable.
- As an artist, you are aware there is this strange money market out there, but you have no sense of how it works.
- I don't think money can help you become a better painter, for sure. You can have all the studios you want; it won't help you make a better painting.
- I think if I was Trinidadian, I would latch more on to the myths and romanticise the place more. I don't think it's my place to do that - they're not really mine. I'm an outsider.
- When I was growing up, I never felt that I belonged anywhere because we never lived in a house for more than three months. That's all I knew, and that's why I don't really belong anywhere.
