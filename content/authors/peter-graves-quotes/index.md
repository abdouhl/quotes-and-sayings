- I think we were born 6 feet tall and then started to grow from there. My dad's not particularly tall - only 5 feet, 11 inches - but his mother was almost 6 feet and straight as a ramrod: a German woman who used to scare the hell out of me.
- I don't know the secret of 'Mission: Impossible''s success. If I did, I'd have probably produced a couple of TV series, made myself rich, and retired!
- Every actor starting out wants to be famous. One of my dreams was always to go to Paris, walk up the Champs Elysees, and be recognized, and by God, it happened!
- You can do bad parts in good pictures or good parts in bad pictures and maybe get a little personal satisfaction. But the key to it all is good parts in good pictures.
- It takes a while to establish a character. Richard Boone once told me he didn't really get the character in 'Have Gun - Will Travel' until the 16th show. You just plant a seed, water it, let the sun shine on it, and hope it blooms.
- I'm trying to get through life without really knowing about computers, but I don't know if I am going to make it.
- I resent the label on cigarettes. If they're going to warn you, why don't they put the same sign at the entrance to every freeway or on every banana that's sold? You can slip on the peel, you know.
- Most shows get dumped by the networks, do a couple of years in syndication, then they're in the vault. 'Mission: Impossible' has never been off the screen.
- I, personally, like good clothes. I appreciate a fine tailored suit, and I'm impressed with the expansion of color in men's wardrobes.
- In drama, you're interacting with other actors to tell the story. The camera is like the theater: it's the artistic fourth wall. In a screen play, you don't look at the camera and communicate with it. But with hosting, you're looking right into the lens and talking to the people. It is a different style, and it's fascinating.
- People have asked me whether I have a science background. No, but I have a great curiosity about the kinds of things we do on 'Discover.'
- You cannot simplify human intelligence, emotion, and growth. To watch the frills and furbelows of a human psyche is fascinating.
- I'm proud of 'Mission: Impossible.' It made me famous beyond my wildest dreams.
- Every actor starts out saying, 'I can play anything in the world: I'm only 25, but I can be a man 70 years old. I'll put on a gray wig and do it.' But nobody hires you for that. You have to play yourself on the screen.
- I had several turtles before they were in. People seemed to think they were funny. Now everyone is wearing them practically every place. I think that's real fine, but I don't agree they should go to a formal affair. Turtlenecks with dinner jackets seem ridiculous to me.
