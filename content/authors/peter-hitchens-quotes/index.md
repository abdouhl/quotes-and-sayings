- If you are foolish enough to defend your own home against burglary, expect to be arrested, fingerprinted, DNA-swabbed, and probably charged.
- If we won't fight injustice wherever we see it, then we are not safe from suffering injustice ourselves.
- Instead of trying to bring freedom to the Arab world, couldn't we just concentrate on trying to fend off the European Union and defending our own porous borders?
- If you know something damaging about a major political figure, then, in a democracy, it is surely your duty to tell the voters before they go to the polls.
- Most of the really successful civilisations survived because they were protected from invasion by mountains, sea, deserts, or a combination of these things. Ask the Russians or the Poles what it's like to live without the shield of the sea.
- There is no such thing as a 'right to buy.' Proper conservatives don't believe in invented, taxpayer-subsidised rights, a creation of liberals. They believe in freedom. And the break-up of council estates was one of the most unconservative things that ever happened, making life harder for young families and destroying settled communities.
- Average male pay is higher than average female pay for a simple reason. Despite decades of enforced equality, women still have babies, and men still don't. So women who wish to spend any substantial time at all with their own offspring will fall behind in their careers, and their earnings will be less.
- People's fates in life are decided largely by their schools.
- A world without a proper day of rest is like a landscape without hedgerows, trees, or landmarks: a howling, featureless wilderness in which we incessantly seek pleasure because we cannot find happiness.
- I still don't understand why we need a gigantic airport sprawled across South East England. What does it gain us, compared with the misery of noise, pollution and congestion it causes in our cramped country? Would it really be so bad if we had to take a train to Paris or Amsterdam to fly to the U.S.A.?
- Radical multicultural types will, in the end, destroy the things they claim to like, because they don't understand that liberty and reasonable equality are features of stable, free, conservative societies based on Christian ideas, which guard their borders and are proud of their civilisation.
- All we have and are is based on the Christian faith, which has shaped law, government, morals, music, landscape, and education here for a thousand years.
- The world's poor have discovered that the E.U. (that's the country we live in, no point pretending there's anywhere called Britain any more) has absolutely no clue how to stop determined immigrants.
- What we need and have not got at Westminster are real experience and wisdom, possessed by people who do not view politics as a career.
- A serious dose of unemployment and a spate of bank failures can make the unelectable electable quite quickly.
- Skimmed milk was what they used to give to prisoners and workhouse inmates to go with their porridge and gruel. It's a punishment, not a drink.
- Revolutions are all based on the false idea that humans and their nature can be changed.
- If you really want to conceal something, leave it lying about where everyone can see it.
- If you claim to represent and speak for the people, and they are forced to pay your salary, you have a duty to experience life as near as possible to the way others live it.
- If a man's reputation can be destroyed in an afternoon by a secret kangaroo court, then we, too, can one day be propelled into a pit of everlasting shame by the same process.
- Our pious horror at the intolerant and repressive behaviour of Islamic State is bitterly funny, given that it is really not that different from the policies of our close ally, Saudi Arabia.
- Comprehensive schools, as too few understand, have never been designed to improve education.
- I think we shall have ceased to be a racially divided society only when we stop making a fuss about colour.
- Successful state schools work because charismatic heads or teachers are terrific bluffers, giving the impression that they are to be feared while knowing in their hearts that they have no real power.
- Thanks to centuries of island freedom, when we were able to decide who came in and who didn't, it is far easier to disappear in Britain than in almost any other country in the world.
- I hate cars and wish they had never been invented. I try to use them only when I absolutely have to.
- The point of Left-wing propaganda is to make us feel powerless.
- I don't think the British or American governments really want to fight the Islamic State. They just want to look as if they are doing so.
- I've tried many times to set out the case against the wicked fantasy of 'ADHD,' which usually earns me nothing but ignorant rage in return.
- Mr. Corbyn reminds mature people of the days when the big parties really differed. He impresses the young because he doesn't patronise them, and obviously believes what he says.
- Do not underestimate Jeremy Corbyn.
- I dislike many of Mr Corbyn's opinions - his belief in egalitarianism and high taxation, his enthusiasm for comprehensive schools, his readiness to talk to terrorists, and his support for the E.U.
- I'm always a bit suspicious of the sort of person who argues by saying 'What would Jesus have said?' They usually mean that they are quite sure Jesus would have agreed with them.
- The most terrifying thing I ever saw in a cinema, thanks to the carefully built-up drama, was in the ancient black-and-white film 'The Innocents,' based on Henry James's 'The Turn Of The Screw.' My skin actually crawled with horror.
- Direct Grants, private schools which took huge numbers of state pupils, involved effective co-operation between state and private sectors - a thing all modern governments claim they want. So why were they abolished? And why aren't they now restored?
- Nowhere in the Beatitudes did Jesus say, 'Blessed are the queue-jumpers,' trying to gain an advantage at the expense of others. This is what the people at Calais are.
- The self-righteous supporters of mass immigration think the rest of us are stupid and evil.
- For every cyclist who jumps a red light, a thousand drivers break speed limits or gape dangerously at their smartphones while driving.
- It's interesting how thrillers reflect the times we live in.
- If migrants from other cultures arrive too fast and in numbers too great for society to absorb and integrate them, they begin to impose those cultures on the host country.
- Female politicos mostly represent a rather militant faction.
- I fear crazy cyclists just as much as I fear inconsiderate drivers. They are like cultists, dressed up like huge insects in dehumanising uniforms, so sure they are saving the planet that they care little for its inhabitants.
- Actually, I never wanted an E.U. referendum, and I think those who called for it will one day wish they hadn't.
- Freedom of speech, for those who don't accept multiculturalism or the sexual revolution, is increasingly limited, mainly by threats to the jobs of those who speak out of turn.
- I'm surprised that more people don't emulate Rachel Dolezal and pretend to be black or members of some other minority. Our gullible society rushes to reward such status, often with jobs and money.
- The worst country I ever lived in, the old U.S.S.R., was crammed with privileges for the political elite. They had their own hospital, their own shops, country houses, and blocks of flats, special lanes on the streets so they could bypass the traffic in their special cars.
- Britain is a desirable place to live mainly because it is an island, which most people can't get to.
- Fear is good and useful when it's deployed on the side of common sense.
- Man without conscience is wilder and more dangerous than any beast.
- The picture of Prince Charles meeting Gerry Adams is inexpressibly sad.
- Every educated and intelligent person glories in the freedom of women in Western societies to exercise their talents to the full and their freedom to walk safely in the streets of our great cities.
- All serious elite institutions, from the great London clubs to the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party, have always made sure that most people can't get into them. That's the point.
- The BBC TV programme 'Back In Time For Dinner' doesn't just have one of the cleverest titles ever. It is a more-than-usually-serious attempt to recreate the recent past, the day before yesterday.
- Nobody under the age of 55 should be able to stand for election, and nobody under the age of 30 should be able to vote in those elections.
- News isn't just what happens. It's what a fairly small group of people decide is news.
- The sad truth is that mass migration, whatever the colour of the skins of those involved, upsets and worries indigenous people, especially the poorest.
- The giant fraud that is Britain's education system strides ever onwards, messing up many more lives than it improves.
- In a supposedly free and equal country, there is no excuse for our rulers having VIP treatment. On the contrary, there is every reason for them to get what we get, hot and strong.
- You know you are old when what you still think of as recent films are remade.
- Fat does not make you fat.
- When I lived in the suburbs of Washington, D.C., I was rather proud that my landlord was almost the only African-American in my unofficially segregated neighbourhood (the other one was the adopted child of our admirable next-door neighbours).
- Our education system teaches the young what to think, not how to think. And if you ever wonder why so many things don't work properly any more, or why you can't get any sense out of so many organisations, this is one of the main reasons.
- Without doubt, the Queen's personal acceptance of her role as a loyal E.U. servant was one of the great symbolic moments of our history. A bit like Magna Carta, but backwards.
- I have visited nearly 60 countries and lived in the U.S.S.R., Russia, and the U.S.A., and I have never experienced anything as good as what we have. Only in the Anglosphere countries - the U.S.A., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand - is there anything comparable. I am amazed at how relaxed we are about giving this away.
- The safest period of my lifetime was the Cold War, when Europe was more sharply divided than ever.
- The Channel is an international waterway through which the Russians are quite free to pass - and over which we have no exclusive right.
- If you want a day free of work, you must expect others to have the same privilege.
- Freedom of speech is freedom above all for those whose views you dislike most.
- If it's for everyone, it's not exclusive.
- If tough old Lefty Helen Mirren can warm towards the Crown after impersonating Her Majesty, who's next? Since reigning and acting have so much in common, it's surprising all actors aren't fervent royalists.
- Gleeful, unembarrassed ruthlessness, once rightly kept in check, has become normal among us, and 'Game Of Thrones' is a success because this change is now more or less complete.
- If you are funny, people will like you. A lot of advertising is based on this simple rule. The Tory MP Boris Johnson has benefited a lot from it.
- I've grown tired of people impersonating world-weary cynics by intoning the old saying 'My enemy's enemy is my friend' as if it were a new-minted witticism.
- MPs do not work for you. They work for the lobbyists who have bought their parties.
- Nobody under 55 knows anything much about life. Nobody under 30 knows anything.
- During the 1980s, many people mistook Thatcherism and Reaganism - actually a wild form of liberalism - for conservatism.
- How I shall miss Alan Rickman, his beautiful command of English, and a voice he played like a musical instrument.
- The Left have always preferred the state to the family.
- The public, unlike our governing elite, are not obsessed by race and sex. They are rightly interested only in the contents of the person's character.
- When I rather guiltily read the books on which the TV series 'Game Of Thrones' is based, I was struck by one thing. The whole point of this saga is that ruthlessness pays, that evil generally wins, that justice is non-existent, and utter cynicism the only wisdom. It is the Middle Ages without the saving grace of Christianity.
- We say we want politicians who are open and honest. And then, when we get one, we angrily pelt him with slime until he cringes to the mob, starts hiding his real views, and hires a spin doctor just like all the others.
- Anyone who seriously wants to keep Scotland in the U.K. must seek to stop the rise of the SNP, not to fuel and encourage it.
- A fierce and principled opposition stops a fat, complacent government from making stupid mistakes.
- Terrorists are overjoyed when we shut down our freedoms and turn ourselves into a police state and when we retaliate, swatting the Middle East with useless bombs or rounding up the wrong suspects and locking them up without charge.
- The Church of England hasn't often produced great men in modern times. But I have long believed that George Bell, Bishop of Chichester from 1929 to 1958, was such a man.
- Rigid, state-enforced sex equality is a Marxist policy, pursued to the outer limits in the old East Germany and now being adopted here.
- As I am actually partly Cornish, I am frequently tempted to start some sort of Cornish liberation front in the Home Counties, where our language rights are badly neglected.
- I wonder how many illegal migrants fanned out across the country while I and others were subjected to the stone-faced, suspicious inefficiency of the Border Force?
- What is the point of the police if wrongdoers aren't afraid of them?
- What many of us object to is the politicians who, for whatever reason, forget that societies cannot easily absorb huge numbers of new citizens. I resent the suggestion that this perfectly reasonable view is motivated by racial hatred or personal spite.
- Work, especially if you're lucky in what you do, is one of the great pleasures of life, but - like all pleasures - it can become selfish.
- Terror works by surprise.
- I ride a bicycle daily in London and have done for many years.
- I can't say I'm sorry to see that the name 'Nigel' is dying out, but I'd be happier if it wasn't being replaced by made-up names out of TV series 'Game Of Thrones.'
- If I never again had to read or write a word about homosexuals, I would be very happy.
- As far as our rulers in Brussels are concerned, Her Majesty can stand for the European Parliament and vote in the elections for it. She doesn't, but she could.
- A referendum is almost always a device by which governments get the voters to endorse what they wanted to do all along.
- At every future election, there should be a slot, at the top of each ballot paper, in which we can put a cross against 'None of the below.'
- Donald Trump is a symptom, not a disease. The disease is the death of real political conservatism: a cool, intelligent reluctance to believe that all change is good, a love for the established, the particular, and the well-worn.
- Real conservatives are in favour of all kinds of unelected power and authority.
