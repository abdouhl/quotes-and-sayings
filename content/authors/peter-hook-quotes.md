- 'Unknown Pleasures' is a very important record for me. It was the first LP that I recorded.

- Any coalition, especially where one party is more powerful than the other, it's always bound to have a pecking order.

- For the first 18 months of Joy Division, we used our jobs to fund the band. We'd all chip in three, five quid to go and do a gig. But it was worth it. It was amazing we could afford to feed ourselves. But we were so creatively and artistically satisfied. You can't explain that to somebody who's never been there.

- When you get the right people together, writing music becomes very effortless.
- I always do try to encourage my children to vote and at least exercise their right.

- 'Movement' sounded like Joy Division, but 'Power, Corruption & Lies' is the first New Order record.
- We don't to be some kind of rock supergroup for the sake of being a supergroup. You want to change things and say something fresh and new so you appeal to people as a new group.
- Originally, I didn't play any New Order when I deejayed. I suppose it comes from being a little embarrassed or humble or whatever. But people were coming to see me because of New Order, so in the end, I had to realize that if they were using my name on the poster, then maybe I should play some of the music.
- Once you made that decision to split New Order up, you were like, 'Woo-hoo! I better get out there and get a job.'
- You look at 30 Seconds to Mars, and you don't think, 'Ooh, I bet they're angry.' No one really does anger these days. I suppose it's a turn-off.
- Over the years, Joy Division has become a huge part of music culture.
- My mother used to always say to me, 'Do naught, get naught.' It's an adage that I hold by. If you don't do anything, you can't really expect anything.

- When I started DJing years ago, I took great delight in annoying the audience. Playing Johnny Cash in the middle of a banging night.
- They amaze me most of those remixes. Some of them are crap. But every time I complain, someone comes up and says they are for a different market that you don't understand. Some of the New Order ones are really great, though.
- The worst words I could ever hear as a bass player was, 'Can you play the root notes?'
- The reason Joy Division and New Order are as influential and successful as they are is because of the unique playing of all the individuals.
- I look back on Joy Division very fondly indeed. I know that, of course, the band came to a tragic end, but that does not change the fact that Joy Division was a great band to be a part of.
- To me, New Order split up when Bernard and I stopped writing together. We started Joy Division together; we started New Order together.

- My father was always Labour, and my mother was always Conservative, so I tended to sort of go in the middle.
- What I've learned is that life is a balance between idealism and realism.
- I was reading an article about Kings of Leon's bass player, who said that he was directly influenced by Joy Division and by me. I was like, 'Woah!' It surprised me. It's a great compliment.
- There are so many bootlegged Joy Division/Martin Hannett tapes, a lot of really bad bootlegs on the Internet.

- Sarcasm is a Manchester trait.
- You don't get many chances in the world, and you don't want to throw them away.
- In the late '70s, the conditions that bands had to endure were, shall we say, not as civilized as they are today. People were a lot more aggressive back then. So there was definitely a lot of suffering for your art. But I would argue that was a good thing. Generally, people make better music when they suffer.

- The scary thing is when I did my set in Texas everyone was excited. The show was great. I was done and the next DJ put something on vinyl and the difference! The quality!!
- I'd rather have ten people who are mad for it than ten thousand who aren't.
- When you balance it against New Order, New Order don't work or tour relentlessly. We definitely work in our own way and sometimes it's a bit too slow for me, so I like to plan ahead and fill my time up.
- I must confess that over my career, I've actually downplayed the importance of DJs. It's such a different art form. Then all of a sudden you try it, and you think, 'Good God, these guys do work.' I used to be very cynical and very blase about it. I can only apologize.
- I am man enough to be able to admit my own mistakes. I think that is an important trait to have.
- Most people have just heard Joy Division on record. And Joy Division on record was completely different than it was live.
- I have a hard time getting my head around the idea of playing 'The Perfect Kiss' in my 50s. I can't quite get there.

- New Order never celebrated anything to do with Joy Division.
- '24 Hour Party People' was a comedy, and I knew that from the beginning.
- I don't pretend to be Joy Division or New Order. What I do is very straight forward: it's an interpretation and a celebration of the music, with different people. Everyone looks at it and knows exactly what I'm doing.
- Dance music tends to be a solitary affair.
- I don't find imitating other people's music easy at all. I remember being fifth in line for a Rolling Stones tour, early '90s, when Bill Wyman left, and I was hoping against hope that I wouldn't get the call to audition. I wouldn't be able to play a Stones song if you put a gun to my head.
- There are seven songs finished and on par with any that are on Siren's.

- To be in one band that changed the world musically is pretty good, but to be in two bands that changed the world musically, that's amazing.
- I read one too many books about Joy Division by people who weren't there, and they always seem to dwell on the dark, the intense, the miserable image of Joy Division.

- My big frustration in New Order was that they played the same tracks all the time.
- Bass players are always the underdogs of the band, but I made sure that I was never viewed as one. I went out of my way to steal as much limelight as I could.
- It was nice doing my own Joy Division book to be able to put forward the fact that Ian was actually quite a nice guy and very hardworking, ambitious and loyal. But the thing was, he was battling such a dreadful illness in an era when they really didn't know how to treat it.
- There are so little outtakes from the Joy Division era. We didn't have much money. You couldn't be very generous in recording, so we were very thrifty in how we recorded. Everything was very, very well looked after financially because we just couldn't afford it.
- Democracy for us tends to be has to do with who shouts the loudest!
- I've watched so-called 'New Order' playing in Auckland, and Tom Chapman is miming along to my bass on tape... He's got his fingers on the low, and you can hear my high bass in the background. So he's miming.
- When you've travelled for 34 years as a musician, you do all the culture stuff when you're young and full of energy. In the middle stage, you indulge too much and are scared of daylight. Then, in the final stage, you've seen it all, so you tend to take things a lot easier.
- I think people expect mud at festivals, I think you'd be asking for your money back if you didn't get it.
- Actually when we stopped New Order I was busier than ever. The only gaps have been while we've been writing.
- We've had a problem finding a vocalist. We have not been lucky yet to find the one. I think the problem is that the three of us have such a pedigree of vocalist, that if we come out with someone that's not good we'll obviously be slated!
- A poetic, sensitive, tortured soul, the Ian Curtis of the myth - he was definitely that.
- That's it really, at the moment I wouldn't say I was influenced by any one thing in particular.
