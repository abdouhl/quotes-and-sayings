- God's interventions are miracles: events that cannot happen by merely natural agents but only by a supernatural agent. They no more interfere with our free will than natural events like earthquakes. We choose how to respond to them.
- God allows unjust disparities between rich and poor because He does not miraculously intervene to establish justice against human wills. Also, discrepancies are not unjust by themselves; justice does not mean equality of result but equality of opportunity.
- All human beings have a right to life. Our unborn children are members of the human race. They're human beings, so they have a right to life.
- Anyone, without exception, can know God if they really want to simply by praying, by honestly telling Him that they want to know Him. He always responds to honest seekers. Jesus promised, 'All who seek, find.'
- A woman has a responsibility and a privilege that a man doesn't have of given birth to another human being.
- You don't have to convince Muslims of God's existence or importance.
- Our life here on Earth has as its purpose precisely to prepare for our eternal happiness. This world is a large womb. It is a 'test' as all opportunities are tests.
- The most compelling evidence for God's existence is Christ. If God does not exist, then Christ was the biggest fool who ever lived.
