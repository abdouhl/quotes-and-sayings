- I drive one car. I own one house. That's enough for me.

- Sometimes you have to trust your guts and your instinct and improvise a little.
- How brittle life is, yet it's been going on for thousands and thousands of years. Maybe we should sit down and pay tribute to life instead of just destruction.
- When I was in school, they say everybody can do art. And I was, like, a little bit obstinate - not an anarchist, but I was always asking questions. I said, 'Isn't art supposed to be difficult?' If we can all do art, then it's not really art. It's supposed to be difficult.
- I like the clowns from the circus that have more paint on their face. They were all funny and made me laugh. As a kid, I remember the clowns that were all in white reminded me more of death than circus clowns. It can be a scary thing.

- I'm a curious human being, and I love things that are a little bit off.
- I have the luxury of being a little boy... To me, the most important thing in life is to be a human being. Second is acting.

- I don't personally like slasher movies that make you scream in the movie theater.
- Everyone that've been here, working, living as Americans - just give them a green card.
- People who are registered to vote should vote. I vote all the time. If I'm not in the country, I do it over mail. Sometimes I don't know who the people are - I just pick whatever girl is Democratic.

- I never want to get tied to one project or be in one TV show forever.
- I don't ever want to have a job where I just punch a clock.
- I like to create characters that are larger than life. But it's funny because I do a lot of bad guys, and it's because, being European, I usually get cast as bad guys. It's just how it is.

- Terry Gilliam is one of the greatest brains I ever met.
- In my career, I've been lucky to do the bad guys that are more interesting, where the audience wants to spend more time with them and get to know them. That's what I'm always looking for and trying to do.
