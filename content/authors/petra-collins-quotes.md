- If your story is being told by someone who doesn't really know it, it's not going to come out accurate. A lot of it has to do with context. Whoever's behind the camera or pen or whatever.

- It's very insulting when you're in charge and someone is talking down to you.
- I know having a social media profile removed is a 21st century privileged problem - but it is the way a lot of us live. These profiles mimic our physical selves and a lot of the time are even more important. They are ways to connect with an audience, to start discussion, and to create change.

- I think a way that feminist photographers work is turning what was the object into the subject and really making it our own.

- With social media and all the new technology, there's just more interfaces around and reminders to constantly be working on our body.

- My mother struggled immensely with mental illness, and so did I. She grew up bipolar, but it was never diagnosed nor recognized. It was shrugged off like a 'symptom' of being female - of her being weak. I also experienced this growing up: I felt that the great pain I experienced was a dramatisation.
- Success doesn't happen overnight.
- I'm thin and white and blond, but I'm not an airbrushed, perfect thing. I have stretch marks all over. I have cellulite; I have acne. To me, it feels like you can't really be what you can't see, and so if you don't see those things, then you don't feel like you're valid.
- I really wanted to feel strong, I wanted my subjects to feel strong, but I didn't know how to do that. It's really hard for, I guess, every woman to not internalize misogyny. I just learned as I went on how to best capture my subjects without objectifying them.
- My favorite place to go is Zabriskie Point in Death Valley. If you see it at sunrise and sunset, it's like you're on Mars.
- I'm used to being told by society that I must regulate my body to fit the norm. I'm used to the fact that images of unaltered women are seen as unacceptable.
- My lens and my personality, it's just fluid. The art isn't just in one place.
- I was very depressed at a young age and felt like I didn't have agency towards that. Being 'female' meant I couldn't be that - I couldn't be angry, loud, sullen. Being sad meant I was weak.
- I came to New York with no money and just one suitcase. I had my family's emotional support, but they weren't able to help me financially.

- Putting your work out there is scary!
- I'm definitely a Sagittarius. I'm such a fire sign.

- It's so rare to see a woman lose control and also gain it back. Women are always told, 'Oh, be in control of your feelings,' and a woman is never allowed to express her anger without being demonised as being PMS-y.
- What's cool is when people send me messages or tag me in their photos, which definitely happens more after a project comes out. The best part, I think, is that the DMs and tags are always from young girls, and reaching them is the most important thing for me.

- Occasionally, I'll wear glitter or blue eye shadow.

- Live what you support online; do things.
- When I do an editorial or when I do a campaign, I bring that lens to every space.

- It's just so humanizing to see someone be real.
- As much as I preach self-love, it's so hard for me to love myself. It's really hard, and it's just about building a good network of people and, in this case, a good network of artists. Trying to live your ideals as best as you can.
- A thing that I'm always worried about doing is putting an image of myself on my Instagram or somewhere else that looks perfect, because that's not who I am, and that's not what I want to preach.
- I just think it's crazy that we don't think that the youth are valid. They're the ones who really know what's going on.
- I approach beauty the same way I approach clothing - I think people should do whatever to themselves to make them feel more comfortable in their skin.
- When I was growing up, my parents would apologize when we didn't have enough money for something. I'd always tell them that it was O.K. and that I had learned to work hard because of them.
- When a woman is anything but pleasant, she is labeled as whiny, hysterical, etc.
- I'm very lucky that I'm not a photographer for hire - people hire me for me. I go into every commercial work with an art focus, with that lens; every brand I've worked for just lets me do whatever I want to do. I have full creative freedom.
- I don't know what I would've done without it. I really struggled in school with reading and writing. Art was my refuge - my way of speaking, of dealing with my own issues and connecting with the world.
- For me, being in a car listening to music has always been my one spot to think.
- There's definitely a romanticism of youth, like, everywhere. Specifically with women, they kind of only exist between the age of 15 to 25.
- It's hard for every girl to accept their body. This is something that I try to work on every day to set a good example.
- As a young woman, I was disturbed by the fact that there was no imagery that truly expressed the experience of a young woman and the challenges and turbulence we go through. All we had were teenage magazines like 'Cosmopolitan,' which are very one-sided and show an objectified view of women.
- Just being with a group of girls and experiencing sadness together - it's a pretty powerful thing.
- Curating, in the modern sense, is something I gravitate to. Taking different ideas from a bunch of different places and putting them into one place or space, a story that makes sense or a new idea. Everything is remixed and taken from other things to make something new.
- You don't have to try to get a job and go through set steps before you start a career or start your life. That's what I want young girls to know - you can do anything you want. Just start.
- I'm used to seeing women being degraded, slut shamed, harassed for what they look like. Even the most powerful women in the world are measured by their appearance and constantly ridiculed for it.
- I'm either working or I'm lying in bed the entire day.
- Feminism is a lens I see the world through and what I believe in. I don't ever use it as a tool of promotion.
- I think the gender norms of emotion are horrendous. Being masculine means showing zero emotions, but having the choice to be angry or depressed. Being female means you are one dimensional - if you show more than that, you are a psycho, hysterical, or historically, a witch.
- We have this weird beauty standard where women, like, shouldn't grow: what we think is feminine is often what is also pre-pubescent.
- That's what I look for in models: Someone who can tell a story and has a presence in front of the camera.
- The selfie is revolutionary to me. It is, I think, the only point in history where masses of young girls and women have been able to control, create, and publish images of themselves.
- I keep this Hungarian wooden candlestick on the top of my refrigerator along with all my other candles. It's big and ugly, especially next to all my pretty candles, and it doesn't really make sense to have in my apartment.
- I think it's important for not just me but women of color, trans women, and people who are marginalized to be telling stories of themselves. It's important for us to be behind the lens.
- I think anytime you can share images that make young women feel a sense of belonging when they might not be feeling their best or their strongest is so cool.
- A good jean that fits someone's butt right is just amazing. It's just classic.
- I always had this feeling, what I wanted to do. I was trying to work out myself, my frustrations, my body. I couldn't really pinpoint. I started taking photos of my sister and her friends. I was 15, exploring what it meant to be a 15-year-old girl.
- I was depressed at a very young age - mental illness runs in my family, especially on the female side.
- Social media has been such a big important thing for young artists and minorities because it's a community to get noticed. It's having an audience that was never there before.
- We work to create a new wave of feminism that is more inclusive. I want others to feel equal. It's so great to see women in positions of power, which is why other artists, such as Marilyn Minter, are so inspirational to me.
- I think being collaborative is definitely more natural for people who are minorities in any sense - so people who aren't, like, white male artists - because we don't have the privilege to create art and work alone, usually.
