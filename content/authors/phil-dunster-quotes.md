- I play a lot of football, but let me tell ya, I am nowhere near as good as Jamie Tartt. I wish that I could play football like he does.
- One of the things that is so exciting about football is you never know what is going to happen, there are variances.
- There is such a strange microculture to footballers' fashion and style and the design that goes around it.
- Manchester is obviously is a huge footballing city with Manchester City and Manchester United there - and I really like this accent because my agent is also from Manchester and my girlfriend's family is from Manchester.
- All of us, as much as we like to think that we're evolved human beings, we're all still children deep down.
- Football wasn't invented until the Premier League, we all know that.
- I really miss so much being at the theater and being able to do plays.
- I think the first thing that I thought I would go and do as a career was be a rugby player. I had a trial with a club and it became very clear, very quickly that that wasn't going to be what I would end up doing. I was far too small and far too much of a lightweight, both mentally and physically, to play rugby at that level.
- 'Ted Lasso' is still funny and it still points fingers and holds truth to power. But it does it in a way that feels like it's a net gain rather than somebody losing out.
- My coming-of-age was really learning to act.
- But listen, there's a reason that 'Baby Shark' is the the most-watched or the second most-watched video on YouTube of all time. It's a catchy one. It just gets you right down deep.
- Some people make up for the awkwardness by being mean.
- I think one of the great things that Jason does, that 'Ted Lasso' does: the way that Jason leads is by delegating. He's really good at going, 'Here's what I think, but what do you think? Great. Awesome. Let's work that in, that sounds great.' It's a real collaborative process with him.
- You know, I keep getting cast as douchebags. I might speak to my therapist about that.
- I think I have an inbuilt British skepticism.
- I think we can all relate to a quarter life crisis when we see one.
- The reason I became an actor was applause and being the center of attention. So, short of that, Twitter is probably a good alternative.
- To be fair, there was one season a couple of years ago when I really got into 'Love Island.' My partner was super into it. It was an absolutely fascinating, in-depth look of humanity through the guys of 'Love Island.'
- It's really rich territory for me as an actor to have somebody who has such a long way to go, but he's trying and getting it wrong. Because I know that I try and I get it wrong a lot of the time.
- I really hope that there are more young men coming to terms with the fact that they feel things and it's OK to feel things and to talk about how they feel about things. That's not weak. It's brave and strong and good.
- 'Ted Lasso' is many things, and I think at its worst, it's a show that is nice and shows that people can be kind and also funny.
- I think a lot of comedy is about making fun of people at the expense of somebody.
- I've done a lot of theater in my time, and in rehearsals, you're like, 'Well, we find it funny,' but until you get it in front of an audience, it's really hard to know.
- Everybody's got the things that are crap about them, and that's inescapable because we're a product of our environment and our environment isn't always great.
- When I was younger, I really loved playing rugby.
- One of the incredible things about doing a show like this is that Jason Sudeikis has it all mapped out in his head. I imagine it's a bit like the tattoos in 'Prison Break.' If you cut Jason open, it's probably like that, but with the story of 'Ted Lasso.'
- And I think that a lot of people in their 20s go through that thing of, this life that I think that I was about to lead, is that actually nonsense? Is that actually something I want to do?... And so they go traveling, or they have a mad relationship, or they dye their hair or whatever.
- London is obviously such a huge, complicated, difficult place, but it's such a vibrant cultural place.
- I think I'm far too much of a wallflower or maybe a fragile flower to be in the military.
- We need to see kindness and we need to see empathy and compassion. That's something we need to see in leadership as well.
- I'd always also been interested in being in the army because my dad was in the army and my brother is an officer in the army.
- It takes a lot of time and good editors, which luckily we have, to make me look like Jamie Tartt.
- How Jamie Tartt came to be Jamie Tartt was that he was originally Dani Rojas - but not as we know him now because Cristo Fernandez is Dani Rojas. They saw Cristo Fernandez and went, okay, we're going to make a character and we'll find a name for him.
- It's really fun being a douchebag but it feels very satisfying to be a douchebag for a reason.
- Being vulnerable and saying, 'I'm sorry,' and trying to be better is a really wonderful thing to see in somebody who maybe wasn't like that before.
