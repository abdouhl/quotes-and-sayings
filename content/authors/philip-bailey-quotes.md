- It wasn't an instant success. It wasn't like I got into Earth, Wind & Fire and we stopped eating oatmeal and McDonald's. But it was definitely a clear path on the right direction to be my own man.
- As young musicians, we cut our teeth on doing gigs at clubs and functions and colleges. That was really the proving ground for young musicians, learning songs, doing covers of different songs that were popular, learning different genres of music.

- I mean, I strive every day, man, to just be the best that I can be.
