- Always being champion, always being at the top every three days, playing great football - it's not that easy.

- Scoring first changes everything. It makes everything easier for us.
- Thomas Muller is an excellent player.

- The most important thing is that we play as a team. It means to attack together but to defend together as well.

- Even if I won so many titles, the first title is not forgotten.
- Many great teams have players who have come through the youth system or have been at the club for a long time as their captains. I'm thinking of Steven Gerrard at Liverpool, John Terry at Chelsea, Raul at Real Madrid, as well as Puyol at Barcelona and Gary Neville at Man United.
- Our sport needs lethal strikers, goalscorers, heroes. But football is much more than the moment of triumph.
- Winning the Bundesliga is never a given.
- You can never know if there will be a second Cruyff, someone with a great personality who can grow up and make it into the squad of the club they love. But what is certain is that, in the Champions League, there will be big clubs producing these players forever.
- Big teams need a core of players who have their roots at their clubs, who grow with their clubs and who embody the culture. Representing it on the pitch and outside as well.
- I joined Bayern at the age of 11, and from then on it was all about being up to the competition. It doesn't matter who you face, you are always the favorite. You learn this at a young age.

- The abolition of the double sanction for a foul in the box is a welcome change. There are times that you cannot help but stop your opponent in the box, with your momentum forcing you to make a challenge. Fouls can't be avoided in that situation but your intention was fair.
- We have always found it easier, and still do, when the opponent plays football as well, when they don't just think in defensive terms, don't just sit inside their penalty box. It's just nicer when the opponent plays football.
- I think that it is advantageous to join Bayern Munich at a young age.
- Except for two years in Stuttgart, I have always worn the FCB jersey.
- The key is developing your game in both directions: in the build-up, joining the attack at the right moment and also in defence. You have to win the one-on-one situations and need the required pace and technique. These are the decisive factors for a defender.
- Was Effenberg a leader because he projected presence or because he had a presence? There is a difference.
- I spend too much time sitting in an office. So I need to play sports on a regular basis, that's why I play golf and tennis.
- Personal vanity has no place in a World Cup.
- Why was Effenberg a leader, because he was outspoken? Or because he had a certain presence on the pitch? When that's the criteria, OK, then maybe I have a different definition of what a leader is.
- Cruyff's idea was, quite literally, to play football - nothing more, nothing less. His idea of how football should be played was based not on controlling the opponent, but on the ball and the game.
- Of course, the moment when the ball hits the net, that's fascinating for kids playing the game and motivates them to join a club.
- I have always enjoyed thinking about playing patterns and I will undoubtedly continue to do so in front of the TV but to become a coach, to be thorough in football at all times, to prepare matches and training... I cannot imagine that I would find pleasure there and pleasure is essential in football.

- As a captain, I have to be courageous but I also want to be nice off the pitch.
- The title I most want is the 2014 World Cup.
- Pep is a super coach! He is excellent. He is the best at analysing an opponent and the concept of a game. I don't know what impact he had on German football, but he left a mark on all of us at Bayern because of how he analysed and educated the players in each position and the way he taught us to play.
- I had a very interesting and exciting life as a footballer, for which I am grateful.
- I have climbed every step of the football ladder, from kicking a ball about in Munich's Olympic Park to becoming a junior at Bayern, signing professional terms, establishing myself in the first team and taking the captain's armband.
- I have played football since I was five years old. This is my core skill and it will always remain so.
- I'm lucky to have played two different positions. But of course the experience I gained as a full back - knowledge of defending, and taking up the right positions, helps me as a midfielder.

- Schweinsteiger has always been an important player for the national team.
- AC Milan would never have been the same club without Paolo Maldini or Franco Baresi and they certainly would have never had the same amount of success.
- Those who have achieved success in football have a degree of responsibility to be open and honest about our 'calling,' our passion.
- In the past, we won tournaments with lots of fighting and lots of hard running.
- When I played for Stuttgart, I met Manchester United and Chelsea. With United, I immediately think of the duels with Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes and with Chelsea, it was John Terry. Those players are symbols of their clubs and the success they had at that time.
- An openly gay footballer would be exposed to abusive comments.
- For me it's more difficult to play against the quicker wingers, but for the team it's perhaps more difficult to face players that are good passers, because one through ball can take the whole team out of the game.
- Looking back at my matches since 2002, there is one main criterion for me which marks a club which is successful in the long-term: big players, who have grown with their clubs, whose names are tied to the success and who have a 100 per cent identification with the team, the club and its history.

- Of course it's not a normal thing to show a good performance every time.

- We know South Americans are impulsive and temperamental and cannot lose.
- My first club was FT Gern. I joined through my parents and friends. My father played for them and a friend from nursery school took me to training once. I was five at the time.
- Klinsmann was the shining hero of the 2006 World Cup when Bayern took him on.
- It's obvious that I'd like to keep the captain's armband. The job gives me a great deal of enjoyment. Why should I then give it up by choice?
- I last played in Dubai in the summer of 2009 and it was still over 40 degrees in the evening. It was extremely exhausting and absolute madness.

- I have a clear goal: the greatest possible success, the World Cup trophy.
- Both football and business are part of my life.
- Clubs like Manchester United or Barcelona have a system, and then you hire personnel who fit this system.
- I've practically grown up with FC Bayern Munich since the age of 11. In my case, a talent scout noticed me when I was playing for a local youth team at Gern in Munich.
- I experienced how Pep Guardiola worked every day. He had football on his mind round the clock: 'What system does the opponent like to play? How do I want to set up my team, who do I want in which position?'
- You only miss many chances when you create many chances.
- Football is teamwork, unity, defence, assists, sacrifice.
- As a full back, your role is just as much in playing in midfield, getting forward and creating chances, as it is stopping them at the other end.
- We have big goals at Bayern and always want to go as far as possible in each competition and win silverware. But it is great to have won the World Cup. You are a world champion for your entire life. A lof of people talk about it and it remains very special. But it's not like I think about the World Cup each morning I wake up.
