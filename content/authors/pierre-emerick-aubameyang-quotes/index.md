+++
- I have progressed. I have worked a lot in front of goal, trying to keep a cool head, trying not to force things.
- Dortmund is a fantastic club, critical for my career. But my Spanish grandfather on my mother's side always wished that I play in Spain. And if, then at Real Madrid.
- To join a great club is nice and all, but you have to play the games.
- I have said in the past that I dream of playing in Spain, but Dortmund has become my second home. I love this club, its fans, and this city.
- I am feeling very well here and want to achieve much more with BVB and win titles. I am here and nowhere else: not at Arsenal, not at Barcelona, and not on the moon.
- Milan offered me something. I was very interested by the project. It did not happen for many reasons.
- You can take it for granted that I am not going to waste any time thinking about giving up how happy I am at Borussia, in the city of Dortmund, and with this team.
- I've played for St. Etienne, and the fans told me I should never go to Lyon. So I didn't go.
- I am grateful to everybody: the training staff, my fellow players, and everybody who works for the club. It is just great.
- The interaction with Marco Reus is also very good. We understand each other very well, both on and off the pitch. If we get along privately, then that affects things on the pitch. We're almost like brothers.
- It's amazing - you know, you just look up, and you say, 'Wow, that's amazing.' It's 25,000 people only on one side, so of course you enjoy it. Every time when you go on the pitch, it's just crazy. They know when we need some energy; they have a button, so it's perfect. But you feel it; you feel it, of course.
- Samuel Eto'o I know well. We see each other often; we send each other messages, and we call each other. It's good.
- Tuchel shows me how to move and what I could do better. He wants to take me to absolute top level.
- A lot of people would like to see me in England. This is not necessarily the league that attracts me the most, though. It would allow me to develop further, though.
- China, I didn't take it seriously; it was a lack of professionalism. They delayed to send us a written offer - It was a disaster.
- Lots of people think that the Premier League would be good for me, but my mum is Spanish, and I really have that dream to play over there.
- It's a great honour to be recognised and appreciated by your fellow colleagues.
- Some players have ambitions, and therefore, they leave and want to experience something new, you know.
- It's great to see my hard work paying off, even if it's not finished.
- Klopp helped me play my favourite position again - centre-forward.
- Klopp gave me strength of character and helped me progress. He's a charismatic person, and I have a lot of respect for this man.
- We had an agreement with Borussia that I could leave. It didn't happen. It is a disappointment. But I'm also happy to stay.
- I focus only on the work with my team-mates with Dortmund and Gabon.
- I have no dream. I shall no longer speak of Madrid. They don't want me. This is not a problem. I move forward; I am well in Dortmund.
- I have the full confidence of the coach, and that's extremely important to me.
- The Torjagerkanone means a lot to me. It was a great effort - made by the whole team.
- I like staying here very much, as I feel at home in Dortmund.
- In football, nothing lasts forever.
- For the parents of the youth of Africa, please give your kids a chance to realise their dreams.
- I hope Dortmund can reach the final of the Champions League again... why not?
- If I didn't believe that I could win titles with Dortmund, then I wouldn't be here.
- In France, sometimes, you have some players or coaches say, 'If we go there, and we come back with one point, it's okay.' Here? No chance of this! Everybody wants to win. I think every team is playing to win matches, so the game is hard and fast, intensive. I really like the Bundesliga for that.
- Our style of play is increasingly based on possession of the ball. It suits me as a forward. We've got an attacking approach, and that means that I get a lot of chances; otherwise, I would have not been able to score so many goals.
- Never would I switch to Bayern.
- I really like the Spanish league and find it attractive.
- No one can predict the future.
- I want to thank my team mates in the national team and also at Dortmund. It is their work that helps me to score goals.
- If Spurs ever came back in me for me, I'd say no.
- I want to get the maximum out of my career. Football is my life. And when my career is over, I want to look after my family to help my children. That is all.
- It is France. I know the league well. It is my mother tongue. Inevitably, there is an attraction for me. A return? It might not be my first choice, but of course, it is not impossible.
- If I want to do something like the Batman mask, I just do it. I was like this all the time; I think nobody can change me.
- If Real want me, they will call me one day, and, if not, no problem. I live my life and am optimistic about the future.
- My childhood dream? To play at Real Madrid. In 2014, before he died, I promised my grandfather who was from Avila, 110 kilometers from Madrid, that I would play there. It will be complicated, but it sits in a corner of my head.
- As far as I know, Mr. Watzke has not said he would sell me if somebody offered 100m. He has emphasised that the club would like to continue working with me. The club is just greedy for success - and so am I.
- People talk about me, and that's good, but a lot of it has been down to how my team-mates have supported me.
- I will choose England before any other destination. My dream has always been to play in one of the top two leagues in the world. Newcastle is a good club, and St James's Park is a monumental stadium where there is passionate fans.
- Robert Lewandowski is a fantastic forward. He challenges me in every match with his performances and goals.
- I'll never go to Bavaria, that's for sure. That would be too hard for the Dortmund fans. No matter what they offer me, I would say no. Absolutely no way.
- Real Madrid? There is no agreement, but I promised my grandfather I would play there one day. Why wouldn't I want to discover new things? As I've said several times, I'd like to play in Spain and have good weather for once in my life!
- Klopp would reproach me for not tracking back properly. I took things on board, and I listened to him. I worked hard in training; I stayed behind after training. That's what helped me to shine in the Bundesliga because I scored quite a lot of goals despite some difficult games in the league.
- I believe, and, when I pray, I ask to become one of the best attackers on the planet.
- Lewandowski is very complete. He can hold on to the ball and build play; he can dribble. He can score goals from anywhere. He is fast, strong in the air.
- It's frustrating when you make the efforts but the conditions are not there to make a great tournament.
- The French league is clearly developing. It is really pleasing to see. Paris, for me, is above everyone else in France. When they come for you, it is always attractive.
- Real is the club of my heart, and I promised my grandfather that I would play there one day. I hope that it will happen.
- I was never tempted by the Premier League. It's simply a personal opinion.
- When I was a kid, I watched Hugo Sanchez videos. The backflip I sometimes do when I score is actually an homage to him.
- The most important thing is that I continue to improve.
- I am really pleased to sign permanently with St. Etienne. It was my ambition in coming to St. Etienne. This is one of the finest passages of my young career.
- I know many people said I couldn't go to China because it would be a step backwards in football terms, but I think anyone would at least consider such an offer.
- I'm like this. When I feel something, I want to do something, I do it - I just do it. So I'm like this also in my life: if I want to wear some crazy clothes, I put it on.
- The only club that could lure me away from Dortmund is Real Madrid.
- It's true that PSG have the ambition to win the Champions League, so they could be interesting for a player like me.
