- Everybody from our block got PnB in front of their name.
- The first time I got locked up, I was in Walmart stealing BB guns.
- I'm like a famous person to some people, not to everybody. I want to be big.
- I can give you a 'Selfish,' and I can still come give you, like, a 'Jealous.' I'm coming from the streets, but I can still give you personal situations and relationships that I've been in with females. You just never know; I'm just coming different.
- It's only a certain amount of days your friend's mom is gonna let you stay at they crib without feeling some type of way. So I'd stay two or three days, then they mom would be like, 'What's up with him? He got to leave unless he gonna pay for something.'

- Once I came along, I started giving more smooth melodies, more songs for the ladies, a new vibe, and Philly wasn't used to all that.
- I like 'Confide' a lot. It was just like a great vibe for me. I was in the studio in Atlanta, and I recorded it and thought, 'This is definitely going on my album.'
- The energy in Atlanta is a different type of energy.
- I pretty much started going more towards the singing route when I came out with the song 'Selfish.'
- You can't be serious all the time. You got to mix it up.
- 'iRun' is just a fun turn-up song, me and Yachty.
- You might have two years probation and do good for a whole year, and you make one mistake, and you got to start over.
- PnB is like a movement, a whole movement is going on.
