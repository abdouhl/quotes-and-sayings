- If I'm going to direct a horror movie, I'd have to be the one writing it, because I have to make it personal.
- I like having a laugh, I like feeling really comfortable on set, so with a sex scene, it's always really planned out for me beforehand.
- I think 'ex-model,' especially in the UK, smacks of being shallow and stupid and having no soul.
- After graduating from University, I began directing in theatre too, and I've been directing, writing and acting ever since, which has allowed me to continue this traveler lifestyle.
- I didn't find it that hard to channel the animalistic side of 'The Woman', I studied animals like apes and wolves, and researched how to throw off my feminine ways and just went out into the woods for a few days to learn how my body would feel if I had to do what she had to do.
- And being an actor already means that working with cast as a director, I have a clear understanding of their position and that collaboration is great and useful.
- The Woman' came off the back of a film called 'Offspring' in which I played the same character.
- I definitely have no stability in my world; I feel the need to be up and merry all the time.
- I've been working for a while with a Scottish suicide prevention charity called The Joshua Nolan Foundation that brings the conversation about mental health into schools and provides free counseling for those who need it.
- I now don't mind if people know about my modelling because I don't feel like it really matters. I feel like I have proved myself as an actress, to some degree.
- But if you are young and want to work in the fashion industry and are not naturally skinny - which most girls are not - then you are forced to be unhealthy.
- I felt that 'The Woman' was a feminist movie at heart.
- I feel that nudity can sometimes be quite distracting and take something away from a film because we're not used to seeing it.
- As far as Lauryn Canny's performance as 'Darlin', it was just so incredibly nuanced and raw and and she's such a hypnotizing person to watch on screen.
- Because the job is still really exciting, and I still get nervous on the first day of shooting. But all the nonsense that surrounds it - that can be on your own terms.
- I do try to do work I believe in and things I'm going to be proud of.
- I have that wonderful release of growing up and thinking, 'I can do whatever I want. I can prioritise for myself.'
- It's a pretty weird feeling when a wolf is scared of you.
- I've always had far too much emotion to be Scottish.
- I was spotted in Glasgow and asked to enter a competition to find the Highland Spring Face of 1995 by the Storm agency. I won the Edinburgh heat, then I won the title in London and moved there aged 16.
- I'm from Scotland, one of four daughters, and we grew up moving every few years between Scotland, Portugal, Colombia and Scotland again.
- It was never a question of, 'Do I get to go and direct?' It just made sense.
- I'm not a fan of horror movies at all, I'm a real wuss when it comes to the genre and I think 'The Woman' would totally scare me if I hadn't been working on it.
- The worst fear you can have coming from a modelling background is that you're going to be a model-turned- actress - a mattress, that's what I call them, ironically, I hope.
- We live in a very masculine society, a very patriarchal society, still. So we also have the benefit of the experience of that society. We're not coming from 'women's world' into filmmaking, we're coming from 'the world.'
- Getting married and divorced really is a learning experience.
- I'm not a Method person, so I'm not like in character all the time.
- I completely love directing.
- If you met me in London, you might be appalled at how English I sounded.
- And oddly, when I was a kid I used to look at junkyards and I wanted to have one of my own.
- I've been inspired for a long time by Nicole Holofcener. I admire her greatly as an auteur, examining the human condition in a funny, growing, spirited, honestly dark and human way.
- I was acting before I was modelling, when I was very young, doing the Edinburgh Festival and that sort of stuff.
- It's funny that for women in horror, we have to use the term scream queen, because there is no term for a villain in horror who is female and powerful.
- Mind you, I was a bit of a naughty one when I was younger.
