- I love American food, but I also love Latin food.
- I would definitely love to work with somebody like Jay Z or Rihanna.
- I sang in English my whole life; I just happened to decide that I had a passion for Latin music, and I wanted to jump into Latin music first.
- I remember when I was working at Sprint, I'd work on my birthday, New Year's Day, and even Christmas Eve. I'm just used to working on my birthday, so I'll be celebrating it afterward.
- As a Latin musician, I understand that there are so many places where people don't know who I am. My albums never came out in Australia or Japan.
- I go skydiving often. At least twice a year.
- At 17, I was working at Sprint in the Bronx so I could make money to fund my own music.
- I'm excited to be launching D'Leon Records to support other young talent in their development. I have been very fortunate to have been able to break through and succeed in this tough industry, and this is one of my ways of giving back.
- I represent New York, I represent the Bronx, I represent the Dominican Republic. And I always have that in mind with everything that I do.
- I always sang in English. It's just that nobody heard me.
- I wouldn't say I'm changing myself to find a new audience. It's about growing, trying new things. There's a whole other world out there that doesn't know who Prince Royce is.
- I sang everything - R&B slow jams, Spanish slow jams, romantic reggaeton - and I really didn't care which I got signed for.

- I grew up playing basketball and eating hot dogs on the corner.
- Bachata is expensive to produce because of all of the instruments.
- I feel blessed to even be able to put out an English album. Not too many Latin artists get the opportunity to come out and record another genre that's so different to Bachata.
- In Spanish, for whatever reason, I lean more toward the high notes.
- My parents and grandparents listened to bacheta heavy, the true bachata from back in the day - Juan Luis Guerra, Anthony Santos. I liked the genre, but I remember thinking, 'OK, enough of this.' I would sing Usher's 'U Remind Me' to the girls in school.
- My Valentine's playlist... you're gonna have to play some Ginuwine. You're gonna have to play some 112. You're gonna have to play some Confession - Usher's - back in the day. You know, a little bit of Prince Royce there, too.
- The way I think or sing about something is very different if it is in Spanish or English.
- I grew up having two different perspectives - one in English, one in Spanish. Two different cultures, very different - but I think that, to me, it's one. I'm just as American as I feel Latin.
- I try to always motivate young kids who want to be singers or actors or whatever it is they want to be that anything is possible with hard work. It doesn't matter where you're from or what language you speak - as long as you work hard, you can achieve those goals.
- My parents are Dominican. I would always go to the Dominican Republic, and I fell in love with Bachata, which comes from the Dominican Republic.
- I think behind every great man there's got to be a great woman, whether she's your wife, your girlfriend or not. I'm not gonna say that there's not that special girl out there. But I'm in the music biz, and I'm focused on the music.
- My dream girl... well, I love eyes. And lips. She has to have nice lips!
- I spoke English at school and Spanish at home, and I'm always eating Dominican food, listening to Dominican music.

- I love hip-hop, R&B, techno and Latin.
- I like eating; I like going to restaurants and trying new things.
- I'm not here to try and replace anyone or compete with anyone.
- I just want to bring the people good music.
- I think when you translate songs, you lose the real essence and the meaning.
- When I hear the songs 'Dangerous' or 'End of My World', I go, 'Wow, I didn't even know I could go that low!' And when I played them for my family, they said, 'That doesn't even sound like you.'
- My friends and I were the class clowns in high school, so one day we were showing off at our seats, and I fell off my chair! I had to get stitches, and I had a bloody lip. I was trying so hard to be a cool class clown!
- My intent is never to leave Latin music. I definitely still want to release bachata albums.
- I think that Valentine's Day is only as good as you want it to be. You know, I don't think it should be anything fancy, nothing crazy. As long as you're spending time with that person that's special, I think that's a great Valentine's Day.
- Media always comments if I wear the same thing twice.
- In Spanish, I record a lot of single-voice tracks, and in English, I 'stack' a lot of voices, so it's very different, and I think I got so used to recording in Spanish for six years that it was really refreshing and challenging to get in and record 'Double Vision' in English.
- I grew up in The Bronx. I mean, I was born and raised in New York City. And I started singing in Spanish because I was always just connected to my Latin roots.
- There's just something about being on stage and being with the people that, once that camera turns on, you find the strength to keep it cool, look good, act like you're not cold, act like you ain't nervous, act like you aren't scared. I think that comes with confidence and practice.
- I don't think I've ever had a bad Valentine's Day, I mean... c'mon, y'all know I never get a bad Valentine. Nah. Um, no, I've never really had - I don't have a bad Valentine's Day. I never really think... it doesn't come up to my mind.
- Most of my fans know I love video games. I say it in every interview, so they know. But one thing that I like doing is skateboarding, I like jet skiing, skydiving. It's like a huge roller coaster ride. Like forty seconds of free-falling. That's some of the stuff I love, daredevil stuff. I like horseback riding.
- I grew up listening to a lot of Usher at 13 and 14. I have every Usher album that ever existed. So I grew up listening to a lot of Usher, Michael Jackson, Luis Miguel, a lot of pioneers in Latin music.
- I like Miami in the winter: there's no humidity, no bugs, no mosquitoes. You go out and wear your jacket, and you're all good!
- I'm very clumsy, so there's been a lot of times I've tripped in front of girls I'm in love with or spilled food all over myself.
- When I was working at the Sprint store, I got laid off. I was bummed out, but I stayed positive. I used the money I had earned while working there to make my first album. Without that job, maybe 'Corazon Sin Cara' would never had been made. It's a very inspirational story.
- Spanish is my second language. When I started, I was doing interviews in Spanish and had to catch up.
- Girls love emotion.
- All my fans are my girlfriends.
- Every time I collaborate with an artist, I want to surprise fans. I want to do something new.
- My whole life, I grew up with this double vision, this vision of America but also Latin community.
