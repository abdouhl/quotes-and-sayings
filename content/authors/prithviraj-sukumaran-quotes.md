+++
- I am a humongous Mohanlal fan. I adore the actor. I am also a huge Mammootty fan, and that's not being diplomatic at all.
- Failure doesn't scare me. And neither success. I am equally detached to both.
- We were shooting for 'Aiyyaa' in Yash Raj studios, and I got an offer for 'Aurangzeb.' That's the only time I went for an audition.
- Directing a film in Hindi is definitely on the cards.
- Even in Malayalam films, I don't mind if I am not cast as hero.
- I don't take my shirt off in every film I do.
- I don't really care about the stardom.
- Even as an actor, much before I turned director or producer, I was somebody who was very involved with every film I was doing. I would pretty much be a part of a project from the time they toss the ball to the marketing. It's very simple.
- I got 'Aurangzeb' because I gave an audition and passed it.
- We have always wanted to give back to cinema, and we couldn't possibly think of a better way to do that than facilitate films which we believe will make Malayalam cinema proud.
- Eleven years in films is a long time.
- As long as interesting work will find me, I will love to do more Bollywood films.
- 'Aiyyaa' was a bizarre film.
- I have always said that the biggest difference between stage and cinema is that one has got close-ups.
- When the script of 'Nine' came along, I saw that there's a possibility of making something that is genuinely new and entertaining at the same time.
- I act, produce, and direct. They are three different jobs all within the same realm of creativity. I enjoy all of them equally, but ultimately, I'm an actor.
- Directing Mr. Mohanlal was a delight. He's completely there and wanting to know what you want him to do. He's very keen on making sure the director's vision is realised.
- 'Aurangzeb' for me is a right film, as there is action and drama.
- I have no plans to quit south films and come to Bollywood.
- I have always believed that when a film is being made, it has to be the director's vision.
- Since I'm serious about a career in Hindi films, I'd have relocate to Mumbai.
- The kind of films that are made depends on the kind of films that are becoming hits. That's why I always say you should be very careful about which film you decide to watch.
- Failure is easy to handle because once you fail, the options are very simple... like, 'Try something different,' or, 'Maybe if you do the same thing, do it in a different way.'
- Hindi has never been a trouble. In fact, Hindi is the only language I can speak and write apart from Malayalam and English.
- All the films that I have signed or I intend to sign are purely on the basis of merit of what the films are about.
- 'Aiyyaa' was not the first film that I was offered in Hindi... it was the first film that I wanted to do in Hindi.
- Every film, regardless of being a success or a failure or anything in between, teaches you something. You might not sometimes realise what it taught you, but down the line, there would be a lesson in it.
- For most people watching 'Aiyyaa,' what I am down South or what I have achieved does not matter. They are going to look at me as an actor who they will see for the first time.
- I have always believed that facilitating good, unusual content should be one of my prerogatives as someone who has spent half his life in cinema.
- 'Aiyyaa' flopped, but it got me noticed.
- I've done more than 100 films, which is a sizeable chunk of life in cinema, so if something can startle me, then I think we can say we're looking at something fairly new.
- I'm sorely disappointed that girls don't recognise me in a normal tee and jeans.
- Acting in two films would mean four months of the year, which would leave eight months for me, and if Bollywood needs that time from me, I am ready to give it a shot.
- If people say Rani Mukerji recommended me, than I have no issue. If someone says that, then I enjoy that kind of news. I don't mind people writing such stories.
- I am in no rush to get anywhere.
- Success comes with a baggage. When you are successful, there is a lot of temptation to not foray outside of your boundaries and just stick to what is successful. It is very tempting because it is very easy to do.
- The biggest challenge Malayalam cinema faces is territorial. We operate within a small territory in Kerala, and the Malayalam diaspora across the world in comparative terms is quite small. But we have world-class talent in terms of technicians, actors, and writers.
- Every movie I do, regardless of how they fare at the box office, excites me.
- I can read and write in Hindi.
- I've done action, songs, and dance in most of my films down South.
- I never went and searched for a Bollywood film. It just happened naturally... it was a natural course.
- Something like a 'Maheshinte Prathikaram' will work anywhere in the world because it speaks of something that is beyond language.
- Though Suparna is a Malayali, she has spent a large part of her life in Mumbai. She's a Mumbai girl. In fact, I saw the real Mumbai through Suparna's eyes. Of course, I knew Mumbai before I got to know Suparna. But it was Suparna who showed me sides to Mumbai I had never seen.
- Every time actors from down south do a Bollywood film, it is always looked at like, 'Oh it must be a one time thing,' or a stereotypical role.
- I have an inherent interest in filmmaking and equipment. Some of my best friends are technicians.
