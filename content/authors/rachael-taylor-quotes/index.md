- I tend not to wear accessories. I'm not one of those gals with a drawerful of amazing jewelry. I don't even have my ears pierced! But I have one bracelet that never comes off my wrist.
- I really like working in television and I like exploring a character over a longer period of time, and I like the consistency of television.
- I think all television has to be about relationships and I don't think horror for the sake of it can work unless you're able to ground it in some kind of relationship.
- I like to work out. I work out hard when I get to it, but it's so sporadic, I'm not sure it counts at all! I eat pretty much anything, but I eat high-quality food. There was never a packet of chips or box of candy in my house when I was growing up. Ever.
- We live in a world of instant gratification, the world of the quick fix.
- I'm all about a flat shoe. It takes a lot to get me into a heel!
- Aesthetically, I don't really like the blond, tan thing. I am pale. So I may as well embrace the pale. Long, blond hair and a bad spray tan is the stuff of my nightmares.
- If incredible creatures like sharks can exist, why not Bigfoot? When I look at sharks, they're the most terrifying, monstrous, dinosaur-like things. To this day, I'm so fascinated by them and can't get my head around how they are on Planet Earth at all.
- I'm not a collector. I toss things out all the time.
- In terms of style I typically veer toward a certain masculinity. My style inspirations range from images of my father in his 1970s suits, to Tilda Swinton, to Hugh Hefner, to Sharon Stone and her ferocious sexuality, to handsome men I see on the streets of New York.
- For me, clothing is nothing without the story behind it. Everything I own evokes some kind of memory.
- I know what I want, I want things for myself, but I think the key to life is somebody to love, something to do and something to look forward to. I don't think it's complicated.
- I can see my ghost trying to get that Academy Award, forever stuck in a casting office. Can you imagine? I've spent enough time in audition rooms. I don't want to be doing that in my afterlife.
- When you are in control of what the final product is, there is kind of no limitation to what you feel like you can do because you know that if you don't like it, you can just cut it out.
- Often, as a young actress, you find yourself being the only girl in a room full of men... and one of the reasons why I like 'Grey's Anatomy' is because they have such strong female characters and the women really drive this show.
- Sometimes when Australians go overseas, it's as though the 'Aussie' is refined out of them. I don't know why. It's never happened to me, because I'm really proud of it. I'm not embarrassed about where I'm from or who I am any more. I know who I am. I don't fit in everywhere, but I know where I do fit in.
- Falling in love, romance, matters of the heart - when you fall in love, on some biochemical level you know there is a chance it won't work out. It's ingrained in us that if you take such an enormous risk on someone with your heart that it might not pay off. I gamble all my chips and I might actually lose everything.
- I realized that I'm a soft person. I think I'm sensitive. I wanted very much to be tough and I think movie stars have a certain kind of resilience and toughness to them, but I'm quite a sensitive young lady in some respects.
- I'm a huge fan of good, procedural-type shows on television... there are a lot of roles for women. But there aren't a lot of great network television roles for girls that will let you start a character in one place and finish up with her in a totally different one.
- The earth is such a voluminous, sparse, wild place that has its own rhythm that human beings try to control and strategize our way around, but the truth is, if you're out someplace like the ocean on a capsized boat, it doesn't matter if you have academic degrees, or if you're a martial-arts ninja. Nature is a bigger force than you.
- If I'm going to take my clothes off I figured I might as well do it for something that I'm directing myself since I had complete control of the edit.
- Young adults in their late 20s are confronted by so many choices - there are so many different paths to choose. Sometimes I think we just fill our lives with stuff so we don't really make any choice at all, which is certainly incredibly luxurious.
- I'm an actor that likes to go to work. I like going to work every day. I'm a worker by nature. I'm not someone who does one film a year and feels satisfied by that.
- I eat excellent bread, clean meat, good crisp veggies, organic fruits and nice wine and cheese. It is one of the things I am truly grateful for. I'm not kidding. You can't ask a single mother of three working two jobs for minimum wage to eat that way. I am lucky.
- I don't really look forward to movie stardom or doing a $200-million movie or winning an Academy Award.
- An inspiring word for me is to think of myself as limitless.
- I definitely wouldn't shy away from doing another action based project, but I feel like my forte is more like playing real, ordinary people. I'm a girl's girl.
- 'Transformers' was important and defining for me because it taught me about what kinds of movies I want to make and the kind of actor I want to be, and I have a long way to go before I become that actor.
- I've done stuff to pay my dues and that's what actors are supposed to do, because I was a really bad actor when I was 18 or 20.
- I like people that are not frightened to say what they think.
