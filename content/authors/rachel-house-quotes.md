- Mum got a QSM (Queen's Service Medal) for her community work in mental health. She was a psychiatric social worker, so she'd travel all around the north visiting people back in the day.
- Taika grabbed me and went, 'Come and meet these guys'. He knocked on this really massive campervan and then the door opened and there's Chris Hemsworth and Mark Ruffalo peering down, then giving me high-fives and hugs. I was like, 'Oh my god.'
- It still surprises me when I get cast in something. I'm not your, you know, I'm... I remember thinking really early on that you have to look a particular way and I'm quite aware of my look, so I always thought I wouldn't get a lot of screen work.
- It's so unfortunate that people have this need to join gangs.
- With 'Woman Far Walking,' that was as good as it gets and I didn't want to do any more. It was satisfying but really exhausting and I didn't want to go back there any more. It was feeling like a 9-5 job and I didn't feel excited about it.

- I have always wanted to direct.
- When I went on to the team on 'Korero Mai,' I realized how much I didn't know and how much I wanted to know in terms of sound, lighting and editing which is a process you don't go through in fast turnaround TV.
- Actors wrestle with it all the time; they want to be liked. They do. They want to play something that people are going to like.
- With 'Soul' I was just here in Aotearoa, New Zealand the whole time so I never got to go to the studios.
- The Brits make the best murder mysteries - I mean, did you see 'Broadchurch'? Wasn't it amazing? I love the mysteries and trying to put it all together.
- It's so nice to be nominated for something by your culture, it's always very cool.
- With theatre, we are always trying to engage in a conversation with people and to bring people into that conversation, but I was disappointed the audiences were not as mixed as I hoped they would become.
- I've never not felt Maori, ever. And because of the era I grew up in, I was never not seen as that. I would walk down the street with Mum and Dad and people would say, 'Look, there's a little Maori girl.'
- With all the stories that we have, it's still rare that we get to see what goes on in the minds of our children when they're in their own world.
- I got this secretive, very secretive email from my agent saying, 'You have an audition for Marvel, no one's letting us know what the name of the film is, but are you available on this day? That's all we know.' And I went, 'OK, well, I think it will probably be 'Thor,' because Taika's got it.'
- Like all good stories, there are universal things that 'Moana' has - a young, resilient, strong woman goes against the wishes of her people and sets out on her own - that's a pretty universal bravery.

- In Maori culture there's a lot of humor and just as quickly we are able to express grief.

- Having worked with so many directors, I liked the look of what they were doing. It seemed to be a lot more creatively satisfying, putting all the parts together, joining the puzzle together, creating the tone of a piece.
- 'Whale Rider' was quite an extraordinary shoot. We were in that community on the east coast and so much of what you see in that film was very present.
- I just haven't had that level of ambition in terms of being a lead in a film or a TV series because I'm really content.
- Diversity is where it's at for me. I think we need more and that could be all kinds of different cultures, big conversations.
