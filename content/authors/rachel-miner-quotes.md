- I have truly eclectic taste in music, and I seem to cycle through phases in terms of to what's inspiring me. I'll go from Beethoven to Sigur Ros; world music, Brit-pop, classic rock, blues/jazz, even the odd bit of heavy metal.
- Basically, I get paid to be crazy. I get paid to believe I'm someone else, live in a completely false reality, and believe it's real. And that's a little scary. And I do it to the best of my ability. But it's kind of like swimming out to sea. You have to leave enough energy to swim back, and sometimes you get scared you swam too far.
- I've done teaching and things like that because if you're acting, you're becoming other human beings, and you need to have time to find who you are as well.
- Part of the excitement of doing independent film is the complete unknown of what lies in store for the film's future.
- I don't think I can play a role without falling in love with something about her; even the most despicable people who I have portrayed had some aspect of them which I found beautiful.
- I love to bake. There's something very ritualistic about it, kind of magic.
- I was a little adult for my age as a teenager, and I didn't feel like I socially fit in with my peers.
- I have all these rules for avoiding depression. One is going outside in the morning. I don't keep breakfast in the house, so that I have to go out first thing when I first wake up. And then I come back and shower.
- A lot of people will call me nuts or crazy, but I've always been pretty stable. By some people's standards, I might be crazy. But I realize that I'm not going to harm anyone, and the only place that I live is within my own universe, really - so it's O.K.
- I'm not cool - quite the opposite. I'm a real geek.
- I've got many different voices - I have a Southern girl, an Irish girl. I have a gibberish language that you'd have to decipher. I guess I try to never take myself too seriously.
- I think my life is often more interesting in the tabloids than it is in real life - or less; it depends. But I'm curious. I just try and see what they're going to make up next, and I try to just have fun with it and not take it all too seriously, because otherwise you can't function.
