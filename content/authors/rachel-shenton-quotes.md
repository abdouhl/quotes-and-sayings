- Everybody should learn sign language or, at least, 'Hello, do you need help? How are you?'
- In the deaf community, there is exactly that - a community. It's like nothing I see in the hearing world. It's old fashioned, I guess, and beautiful.
- My dad lost his hearing in the last 18 months of his life, and as a result, I witnessed first-hand the effect that this can have on a family.
- The cause is very close to my heart, and I'm proud to be supporting NDCS in helping deaf children overcome the challenges they face in everyday life.
- I've been involved in the deaf community for years, and my friends in the community that are actors or performers get very frustrated when they see hearing people portraying a deaf role.
- We need to be a bit kinder and more aware of what is really important.
- Millions of children all over the world live in silence and face communication barriers - and, particularly, access to education.
- I feel that Britain is a rather self-deprecating nation: you're almost considered egotistical to say you're good at anything.
- To be honest, the first thing that hits you when you step off the plane in L.A. is just how eager people are to help you out here - or, at least, that's what I've found.
- I'm hoping I can fill a gap by helping to advise people on acting mechanics - the kinds of things that, looking back, I would have really benefited from as a teenager.
- I stay in touch with a lot of the cast - Jess Fox, Jen Metcalfe and Nikki Sanderson and probably more that I've missed out. It's a cliche, but it really is like a family at 'Hollyoaks.'
- I've done my fair share of fundraising over the years, and I know how difficult that can be, so I could only imagine people's reaction when I was asking them to part with their hard-earned cash for a movie.
- The 3,000th episode is a great milestone for 'Hollyoaks,' so it was just really nice and a big honour to play a part in it.
- There are plenty of good drama schools and academies helping children and young people to learn to sing, dance, and act.
- I'm so excited, and I feel very lucky, as to be working in L.A. is a bit of a dream come true for any actor. I definitely have to have a few 'pinch myself' moments as I'm driving to work in Hollywood!
- Due to the closure of many deaf schools in the U.K., deaf children are forced to attend mainstream school. I don't mind this idea: I think it's inclusive, and it better prepares children for life in a hearing world. I don't mind this idea - if that child gets the right support.
- Living in Los Angeles is pretty cool.
- I've seen the needless struggles that deaf children and deaf people face, and that gave me the impetus to write.
- We value 'stuff' quite highly. Why? Because that 'stuff' apparently matters. Not only that, we use it as a measure of how successful we are, and as a result of that, having more of this 'stuff' often determines how people treat us.
- At first, I simply wanted to get a basic understanding of sign language, but as time went on, I really got the bug and wanted to become proficient so that I could make good use of my skills.
- I always say deafness is a silent disability: you can't see, and it's not life-threatening, so it has to touch your life in some way in order for it to be on your radar.
- I'm extremely proud of 'Hollyoaks.' No one could be flying the flag more happily.
- I'd love to do something hard-hitting, like a lawyer or a policewoman, something like that. That would be nice.
- I'm beyond excited to join the cast of 'Switched At Birth' and to be part of such a great show on a great network.
- For me, film is an extremely powerful way of conveying a message to a mainstream audience.
- Dad could speak with a strong voice. And luckily, he was very good at lip-reading, so he was able to disguise his deafness well. He tried various hearing aids but would find them fiddly and uncomfortable, and worse, they often made horrible high-pitched noises.
- There are things like the importance of having a showreel, a headshot, a cover note, a tailored CV - these are all really important when you are trying out for roles.
- 'Switched at Birth' has an amazing cast, including an Oscar winner and two Emmy nominees. The writing is very innovative, and the show's producers have redefined U.S. TV by launching a mainstream show which includes multiple deaf cast members whose characters communicate only in ASL (American Sign Language).
- I like to think my accent isn't strong enough, but it's funny: I get people coming up to me in America and saying I sound like Mel B. She's from Leeds. They just hear a British accent and probably can't quite work it out.
- I think I'd really enjoy doing some more theatre, because that's where I started off.

- When someone walks into me, whether it's my fault or not, I say, 'Sorry.'
- Deafness and sign language are extremely close to my heart.
- With the right support, a deaf child can do exactly the same as a hearing child, yet constantly, they're being failed.
- Inequality within the deaf and hard of hearing community is something I feel really passionate about and always will do.
- 'Hollyoaks' really is such a great place to work, and there was nothing bad whatsoever about my time there. I loved my job, I loved everybody that I worked with, and I was blessed with great story lines.
- I've seen a lot of people in my life base their self-worth on what job they book or don't book, what car they drive, or whether they can afford a house deposit or not.
- Being at the first post-Weinstein Oscars was amazing. It felt like there's a spotlight on diversity.
- I really enjoy being involved in 'Hollyoaks Later' - it's great.
- It's really important to remember that disability is diversity, and that disabled actors and disabilities are something that is hugely under-represented in film.
- There are many issues within the deaf community but, for me, none more important than access to education for deaf children.
- When you're an actor, it's really great to be busy - that's what we all want!
