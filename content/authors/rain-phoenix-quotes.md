- I want to be in love with what I do at all times, and I want to stay in love.
- I started singing at age three - I opened my mouth some time, singing along to the radio, and my parents were like, 'Wow! You have a really great voice!'
- I like to record records in Los Angeles. It's less distracting than New York, where I was based.
