- But we're aware of the danger all the time. We all know what can happen. I jump in the car and forget it. If you start thinking one of us will get hurt it's more likely to happen.
- If I were afraid, I'd quit Formula One immediately, I've earned enough.
- If you pursued every rumour in Formula One, you'd hardly have time for anything else.
- My target is to win the World Drivers Championship. I want to be the best.
- On the one hand, having Michael as my brother has been a help. It brought me contacts and opened the door to motor racing. But to keep that door open, I would have to say it's harder for me.

- The fact is that I've got a contract with the BMW Williams F1 team until the end of 2004, and that the team will naturally be my number one negotiating partner for the following period.
- I made mistakes off the track and have learned from them.
- Frank Williams says I'm nothing but a money-grabber. I can only laugh at that.
- Whenever we had a good car then it was possible for me to perform well.
- By 2002 we might be championship challengers. But I want to race fast. I want to become world champion myself.
- Well, to be honest, technically speaking there are more demanding circuits than the A1-Ring. But, overall, it does pose its challenges - both for the car and for the team. This circuit should not be underestimated!
