- One of the best animated films I've seen come out of Disney was the Tarzan movie. I wasn't crazy about the story or the design on Tarzan's face, but the traditional animation was spectacular.
- Wizards was my homage to Tolkien in the American idiom. I had read Tolkien, understood Tolkien, and wanted to do a sort of fantasy for American kids, and that was Wizards.
- Look what Disney's done to their animation department. There wasn't an animator in charge of their animation unit!
- I thought I had the rights to The Lord of the Rings. I don't know how Jackson ended up with the rights.
- You can't second-guess yourself as a filmmaker.
- Sweetheart, I'm the biggest ripped-off cartoonist in the history of the world, and that's all I'm going to say.
- Film has to describe and show.
- As an artist, I want to interpret my feelings - not run across the street and ask what my mother thinks.
- I miss animation very passionately. Not continuously, but every once in a while I would die to do another film.
- They say I'm a revolutionary, but they're all wrong.
- I'm having the same problems today that I had when I first started, saying that outrageous adult animation works.
- I draw what I feel, which is no more than doing my job.
- I animated 20 years at Terry Toons. It's important to know that animators like pizza and a raise once in a while, and you've got to treat them with love.
- I would like to have the original ending to my Lord of the Rings instead of the one they released. In my original cut I had the victory at Helm's Deep as the final sequence.
- Animation is tremendously resilient. Animation will recover, as art always recovers. There's always cycles of good art.
- All the old great companies were run by guys who knew what an animator meant, and guys who knew how to draw. All the companies today are run by executives.
- The rise of anime had to happen. If the Japanese could tell better American stories, it would go through the roof. They still tell stories which are very much oriental. I take my hat off to them.
- What's most important in animation is the emotions and the ideas being portrayed. I'm a great believer of energy and emotion.
- I had the X rating on my films. Now they do as much on The Simpsons as I got an X rating for Fritz the Cat.
- Painting pictures didn't make me a lot of money. I have to eat.
- I am not interested in slickness for the sake of slickness.
- I'm the first to admit that I can't be as good as Tolkien, and a movie can never be as good as Tolkien.
- Too many of Disney animators, and a lot try to emulate Disney, are trying to hit what they call quality levels. They're boring mannerisms.
- Disney had such a hold on the mind of America-they were Adolf Hitler. The whole country thought Disney was some sort of god and that animation was some sort of pure thing for children.
- My movies continue to be found and be sold because there's something going on in them.
- Live action writers will give you a structure, but who the hell is talking about structure? Animation is closer to jazz than some kind of classical stage structure.
- Most of the animated films I watched, the emotions are all prepackaged like canned music, the hand actions, the sighs.
- Lord of the Rings made me realize that I'm not interested in doing anyone else's work.
- My good films were independent and my bad films were not.
- Cartooning at its best is a fine art. I'm a cartoonist who works in the medium of animation, which also allows me to paint my cartoons.
