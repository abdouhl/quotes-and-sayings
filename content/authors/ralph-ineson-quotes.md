- I have a penchant for Tammy Wynette and Dolly Parton.
- It can be embarrassing being associated with a character like Finchy - people naturally assume you're just like him. Some people come up and tell me the most appalling sexist or racist joke they know because they see me as him.
- I'm sure most actors, after a while, get a bit jaded.
- I'm bad with money.
- After university, I taught in a sixth-form college in York for a year and a half before deciding to try acting.
- Mo-cap work is less technical than you'd expect. Once you have it all set up you're free to do the whole scene in one take rather than doing a lot of different shots and different takes like you do in a movie. You've got that one go at it and you've got a lot of freedom. You can really express yourself - more like doing theatre than doing a movie.
- When I am stressed I pluck my beard, leaving bald patches.
- Because of the way I look, I tend to play bad guys.
- Let's face it I have never been a pretty boy and so it's not as if I am going to lose my looks.
- At castings for commercials, you end up being told to do ridiculous things, such as animal impersonations. You probably get one commercial for 20 utter humiliations.
- I always just like to do good stuff, and I'm very, very lucky that I do almost everything. I do theatre, radio, TV, film, and also comedy and drama as well.
- The Office' was nothing like anything I had ever done before - the style, everything. And Finchy is so over the top, I really did think it would ruin my career.
- I have two amazing children.
- Everyone says comedy is really hard, but with 'The Office' the naturalism was everything so it didn't feel like doing comedy; it just felt like doing a really offensive character who thought he was funny.
- Finchy is foul. And there is no way I would be mates with him.
- You can't go wrong with pirates. I mean, they're pirates. It's what everyone wants to be when they're a kid. Ninja, assassin, or a pirate - and now you can kind of be all three.
- Nobody knows what they're doing, so don't be afraid to try things.
- My granddad was not a tall man but he weighed about 27 stone and my first memory is crawling across his belly. I remember it being a journey.
- I have been so lucky when it comes to work. It's great to do so many different roles.
- Once I won the roles in 'Spender' and 'First Knight' it was much easier for everyone, me included, to get their heads around the idea of me being an actor.
- I don't think you can predict success, but you get a feeling if something's going to be good or bad.
- Not that I am hugely working class, but in the U.K. I'm always perceived, casting-wise, as being working class.
- I've always wanted to be a Bond villain. I'll probably have to do make do with being a henchman but I'd be quite happy to do that.
- I think 'The Witch' was actually my 100th job. Only took me 100 jobs to get a lead! But it did change things a lot. It was a magical thing for Rob Eggers to pick me out of the all the actors he could have for that part. It was an amazing part. It's changed my career massively.
- I'm usually the bad guy, you know, but I do a lot of different genres of acting.
