- Life is a series of steps. Things are done gradually. Once in a while there is a giant step, but most of the time we are taking small, seemingly insignificant steps on the stairway of life.
- Man was created as a being who should constantly keep improving, a being who on reaching one goal sets a higher one.
- Before the reward there must be labor. You plant before you harvest. You sow in tears before you reap joy.
