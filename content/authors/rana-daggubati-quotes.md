- When 'Dum Maro Dum' came my way, I took it up without thinking that I was crossing any boundary. It was a good film, and I wanted to do it.
- We see many posters and standees at cinema halls, and some catch attention. But these posters are soon forgotten. Taking a picture with the actors, enabled by AR, helps record a memory.
