- There are stories I'd like to tell, I'd like to see, and they're not getting made. These stories are beyond the experience of the people in power. They don't understand it, so they're frightened of it.
- If you and I had a relationship, and I like to dance and you don't, will that affect our relationship? If I push you and push you, maybe you'll learn to dance, but more likely, that will move you away from me.
- As a director, you're looking for ways to tell the story with the whole image and not primarily dialogue.
- A barrier for me - which has been both a strength and a weakness - has been my taste. The kind of things I'm interested in aren't always mainstream.
- I do know that detachment is important. A surgeon can't be weeping into the open wound.
- A doctor is not a mechanic. A car doesn't react with a mechanic, but a human being does.
- Because I had a lot of emotional upheaval in my life, I'm attracted to stories about characters whose lives are full of wounds and secrets. I'm not interested in who's going to ask me to the prom. I never went to a prom.
- It's very scary to turn things down, but a project has to really mean something to me. I'm not interested in making a lot of money.
- I like to look at 'A Place in the Sun' every now and get inspired by it.
- I would love to do a film with a lot of humor in it: a comedy with pain instead of a painful film with some comedy.
- I'm always drawn to stories about characters who are somewhat isolated inside themselves by their inability to communicate in some way. That's what interested me about 'Children of a Lesser God.'
- To adapt a play into a movie, you have to change it.
- I've gone for long stretches without working. I remember many times peeking into my checkbook to see if any money was left.
