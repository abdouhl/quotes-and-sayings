- I think both Georges St-Pierre and Anderson Silva are establishing legacies just by how long they've maintained their championship runs. I think both of them still have a lot left in their careers.
- I started wrestling at ten. I played a lot of other sports: soccer, football. I really enjoyed skiing. But wrestling just took off for me. It seemed to be the sport I had an affinity for; I liked the individual, combative nature. There's something special about that. It took me all the places I wanted to go.
- 'Fight Master' is a show that Spike came up with. Obviously, Spike has a vested interest in Bellator, which is filling a void that was created when the UFC and 'The Ultimate Fighter' left and went to Fox. I think this fills a huge piece of the puzzle for the folks at Spike, in terms of demographics and what programming they like to do.
- 'Fight Master' is a proving ground for young, aspiring fighters who want a chance to play on a bigger stage. That's something it has in common with 'The Ultimate Fighter,' which has always been like a farm league for the UFC, a place to develop new talent.
- I definitely see myself continuing to transition into more acting roles. I'll always be a coach. I'm always going to have a training center, always going to work with guys that are looking for some input and want help. I love commentating, and that's something I can always go back to and enjoy doing.
- I do my best to stay away from dairy, especially ice cream. I've become a cookie monster whenever I want to mess around and eat something cheap.
- A lot of us lead relatively sedentary lifestyles, so you have to motivate yourself and force yourself to go to the gym and do active things. The folks that have figured it out, found that thing that they love and made it a big part of their lives, it's easy for them to stay in shape.
- You have to find ways to relate to the characters you get to play. Put it in terms and in a context that speaks to you.
- The most important thing that I've figured out is that things work out the way they're supposed to. We try to have all this control and fashion things the way we want, but everything happens for a reason, and in the end it works out the way it's supposed to.
- A lot of these guys in 'Fight Master' will compete in Bellator and in mixed mart arts for quite some time.
- I have several businesses that revolve around fighting: the training centres, the clothing line and all that stuff. I'll probably be involved in the sport in some way shape or form, and I'll continue to train and be active and do the things that I love to do.
- When people first started watching UFC, it seemed like a no-holds barred event... early on it looked like all the fighters were crazy. Actually, there are a lot of techniques, and the reality shows have let people see the fighters behind the scenes.
