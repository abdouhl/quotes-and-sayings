- Unfortunately, injuries are part of the game and you have to adapt, keep faith, trust and never give up.
- In my position you talk about a mature player being around 28 and it is normal that you improve.
- In terms of pressure, El Clasico is unique, but also a match against PSG is a stimulating and exciting clash.
- I'm quite shy and quite reserved. But when things start heating up, I don't hesitate to show my character, whether that's in good moments, like when we won the World Cup, or more difficult moments.
- At 20 years old I'm eager to play and to watch from the sidelines isn't easy.
- In Madrid there is a lot of competition.
- The thing with Mourinho is he asks you to do what you are good at, but not to over-do it.
- Since I was seven years old, they say 'he's nice, he's nice.' Yes, I'm nice, but that's not all I am.
- It was the craziest period of my life: I was getting ready for the baccalaureate, the phone was ringing off the hook, I visited the Real facilities, I met Alex Ferguson.
- The most important thing to me is time spent on the pitch.
- People have wanted me to change and it annoys me. Do we ask Ramos to be someone else? We take him as he is; take me as I am.
- I try to give the squad my peace of mind, my experience of big competitions and to be myself.
- I see football as a team sport, I'm not looking for the spotlight.
- I watch a lot of players in my position, but if I had to name a role model, I'd say Lillian Thuram because of the way he carried himself on the pitch and everything he did in his career.
- We do a team sport. Individually, you're worthless!
- It's the desire to keep winning. Each season the counters are reset to zero. You've either got a title to defend or one to go and win. We want to keep making our honours list longer.

- Having the ball means creating chances and scoring goals.

- It's not a fault in football to be ambitious, far from it.
- When they are stronger I try to pass in front, that I cannot play. Like Lukaku, for example. He is the strongest forward in the world. He is pure power.
- When there's a need for someone to speak, I'm there. When there's tough times, I'm there.
- One player who gives me a lot of advice at Real is Pepe. He's taught me never to give up. He always gives 100 per cent on the pitch and he tries to instil that winning mentality in me.

- Things come naturally in a career. From experience, I know that things progress season by season.
- I have memories of watching the Champions League as a kid in France. We all supported different teams and they were intense moments. Great memories.

- If I know where I want to play before I receive the ball, it's easier. It's more fluid.

- I just play to my strengths and my ability.
- It would be against my nature if I shouted or banged the walls.
- What's for sure is that the profile of the central defender is evolving. At one time it was all about the stopper and the libero. Today, central defenders have to be more complete.

- Don't call me an intellectual. After all, there are a lot more people taking their A-levels each summer than signing for Real Madrid. I was just a good and serious student.
- During my second year at Madrid, Jose Mourinho gave me a kick up the backside. I wasn't doing well, I wasn't managing to do what he wanted me to out on the pitch. So he chided me, saying: 'Why don't you run in training?' My first reaction was to mutter, 'Oh come on... ' But I knew he was right, I had more to give.

- First, you arrive at training, prepare for the session, I get treatment from the physios and go straight to the gym to activate the body.

- A good run is always good. It helps us to wear the colours of the France team.
- Mourinho doesn't need to give long speeches. He's direct and to the point.
- Zidane has tried to get me to improve. Anticipating, reading the play, putting myself in the defensive balance, I know how to do all this. So he expects the same finesse in an attacking sense.
- I am a shy, quiet and cool guy in life. And I am no different on the pitch.

- I have my style of play and people can criticise me for that which is not a problem.
- I know the players with whom I play well.
- PSG were interested in signing me, but we never entered negotiations.
- Just imagine, I was doing exams and signing autographs for other students. It was surreal. I'm really proud that I passed.
- Ronaldo is a bon vivant, he is friendly, he always has something to help you progress. He wants to be the best around. It infuriates him when he loses, he cannot stand it. It's true that sometimes, in the dressing room, it's fun to lose just to make him mad!

- When you're young you want to show what you can do, but sometimes you have to learn not to over-complicate things.
