- There is no better teacher than life itself.
- One of my favorite outfits is one I picked up on a trip to Chandigarh. I've worn it once and am skeptical about wearing it again in spite of loving it so much, thanks to the 'fashion police' who won't wait a second to splash it out in the papers or feature me in the 'same to same' blog.
- I am not a foodie; I eat to live.
- Wearing shoes, clothes, and other accessories made out of exotic skin is as cold-blooded as it gets.
- I suppose it is easy for an actress to act maternal at any age, since all women have a nurturing instinct after 20, perhaps even earlier.
- One thing that really gets on my nerves is people spitting on the streets! I fail to understand whether they are just plain uncivilized or uninformed about how the act only helps in spreading diseases.
- I'm fed up of doing run-of-the-mill stuff.

- I have always said what is in my heart.
- I'm on backslapping terms with everyone from Sanjay Dutt to Sanjay Kapoor. That's why wives never feel threatened by my presence in their husband's lives. They know if I'm their husband's friend, I'm the wife's buddy as well.

- People fall in love when they are working together constantly.
- Communication is extremely important in any relationship - it makes the relationship that much healthier.
- Whenever I'm traveling, I see so many auto drivers spitting on the road, and it disgusts me to no end.

- Your skin and your face is a mirror to your soul. When people ask me why I'm looking so good, I reply, 'My heart is happy.'
- My dad taught me very early in life that whenever a child learns to walk, he falls a lot of times, but then he picks himself up and learns to walk like a man, and that is something which is a motto in life as well. You gotta pick yourself up, and you gotta walk, and you gotta walk strong.
- I still remember the way children used to tease me. Fat people are really lonely people. In school, girls would be my friends, but guys would generally keep away. A lot of insecurity stems from there. But if you have a strong base, nothing can shake you.

- I especially have very fond memories associated with the 10th day of Dassera. My friends and I would meet up and build this huge 7-feet-tall Ravan, which we'd burn at around sunset in our colony. And this was no ordinary Ravan. We'd actually sit and hand-mix the contents of glue and glitter with the dough and wrap it around newspaper for the base.
