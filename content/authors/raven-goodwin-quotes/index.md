- If you truly want to succeed, you have to stay humble - humble or crumble - because it can all go away in the blink of an eye.
- A message to women in general is be happy with yourself first. Be sure that you take care of yourself and find yourself. Be comfortable! And you will be way more appealing. Do what's best for you, and everything will fall into place.
- 'Huge' is a show about self-discovery and follows kids at a weight loss camp. My character is shy, so when she meets Nikki Blonsky's character Willamena Rader, who's not, they become friends.
- I'm really into old school music when hip-hop first came out with Common, A Tribe Called Quest, Queen Latifah, MC Lyte, and Run DMC. I'm really into that! Hip-hop these days isn't the same and doesn't have the same sound anymore. I'd rather listen to the old school hip-hop.
- My mother and father definitely encouraged me. People used to tell my mom that I should be in commercials, and then everything kicked off from there, and my first gig was some print work.
- 'Being Mary Jane,' I really want everybody to see what we've done. I've never watched a project that I've worked and thought, 'Damn that's really good. It's so juicy, and it's hit after hit.'
- Making a transition to the adult acting industry was pretty smooth for me, and I had a great balance and a great opportunity not to do just children shows.
- The show is definitely not just about weight-loss physically. It's more about finding yourself. It's really funny because I realized at one of our table reads that 'Huge' was really about the weight that we carry around mentally.
- It's always good to be around people who get it and understand because it's a huge difference working on a black set. I can walk on a black set and not have to worry about my hair because they know.
- I was a huge movie watcher, but I really loved 'Kenan & Kel,' 'Rugrats,' 'Doug,' & 'Catdog.' I was also into drama films, though, and I really loved 'Poetic Justice' and 'Set it Off.'
- Acting comes first. I would love to make an album. I was at an event... for Dionne Warwick, and we got to go in the studio and go crazy. I love singing, but it's very time consuming. I have to make time for it.
- I went to elementary like any other kid, but I was just always a little different. I had that sparkle, and everyone told my mom, 'She needs to be on TV, acting.'
- I freestyle, but I'd rather sit down and write down my music to map out what I'm doing. But if I'm out with my friends, I will freestyle, you know?
