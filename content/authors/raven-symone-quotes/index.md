- I believe you should be comfortable in your skin no matter what you go through - emotionally or whatever - as long as you're healthy.
- The way we function in society - it doesn't make sense sometimes because it's all based on how you look and then how badly you should feel after you eat the food we just advertised. And then when someone in the public eye goes up or down, it's like a major moment.
- I've definitely had obstacles in my career - my whole entire career - to stay a certain weight, to get smaller than I have been, but I look at my family, I look at where I come from and that's not really in our genes.
- Everybody takes breaks, and I decided to take mine. I wanted a chance to wake up at two in the afternoon and not be a subject of entertainment. I wanted to be a human being. At certain times and certain years, I felt like the Energizer bunny. That gets old very quickly.
- I went to public school, elementary through high school. I went to homecoming, to football games, pep rallies, I got detention, I got an F. I've done it all.
- It's difficult to not be able to just be yourself without criticism in any position, whether you're in high school, college, or this industry.
- I am obsessed with my hairstyles.
- I used to breed poodles. I liked them because they were fluffy and so cute - and honestly, they make a lot of money when you sell them!
- I'm not perfect. This is how I was raised. If I wasn't in the industry, I'd be the same person.
- Singing is just another outlet to express what I feel and to show everyone who I really am. I really don't talk about my personal life that much in interviews because that's my life, but with music, the way I write explains who I am.
- It's important for young people to know that they are made the way they are made and they're beautiful and that's how they're supposed to be.
- I'm not one for a public display of my life.
- Be very professional because it will get you a lot further. You have to treat people with the same respect whether they're signing your checks or cleaning up after you.
- I find it funny that people now come up to me and say, 'Wow, you are absolutely gorgeous. I'm like, 'I was beautiful before I lost weight. Egotistically speaking, I thought I was amazing.'
- Behind closed doors, I'm a crafty person.
- I think our society is all about judgment, which is so rude and disrespectful.
- I have a responsibility to not look crazy in public. I don't want to be the person where later in life when I have kids, to say, 'Don't do this' and my kids go, 'But Mom, you did it.'
- I love to see the smiles on people's faces when you cook for them. I love to go to different restaurants. I want to cook because I know this acting isn't going to last forever, and I want something to fall back on. It's another way to make people smile.
- I'm definitely addicted to purses.
