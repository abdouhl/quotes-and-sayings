- Many people, especially young people, have started listening to sitar since George Harrison, one of the Beatles, became my disciple.
- In India, I have been called a 'destroyer.' But that is only because they mixed my identity as a performer and as a composer. As a composer I have tried everything, even electronic music and avant-garde. But as a performer I am, believe me, getting more classical and more orthodox, jealously protecting the heritage that I have learned.
- To me, you know, from my childhood I always had a fascination for United States.
- I enjoy seeing other Indian musicians - old and young - coming to Europe and America and having some success. I'm happy to have contributed to that.

- I believe in one thing: that anyone who is able to do something good for someone, I mean, should be praised.
- I was admired by all these hippies, and it was wonderful playing at Monterey and Woodstock, performing for half a million people.
- I will keep playing as long as my body lets me, and as long as I'm wanted by my listeners. Because music is the only thing that keeps me going.
- Pop changes week to week, month to month. But great music is like literature.
- My music has a very spiritual background, a sanctity that is almost like worship.
- I have great difficulty sitting in the middle of the night and writing. Everything I do comes spontaneous. Sometimes it takes a long time; sometimes it comes just like that.

- When people say that George Harrison made me famous, that is true in a way.
- In the olden days, I believe Mozart also improvised on piano, but somehow in the last 200 years, the whole training of Western classical music - they don't read between the lines, they just read the lines.
- There are thousands of ragas, and they are all connected with different times of the day, like sunrise or night or sunset. It is all based on 72 of what we call 'mela' or scales. And we have principally nine moods, ranging from peacefulness to praying, or the feeling of emptiness you get by sitting by the ocean.

- I was invited for the first Woodstock. Actually, I started the programme.
- Everybody has a right to like or dislike anything or anyone. From a flower to a flavor to a book or a composition but it is very sad that in our country we actually fight over such things in an unseemly manner.
- I appreciate very much Vilayat Khan, the sitar player, and Bismillah Khan, the shehnai player; and among the tabla players, of course, Alla Rakha, Kishan Maharaja, and all these people.
- I have always had an instinct for doing new things. Call it good or bad, I love to experiment.
- My brother had a house in Paris. To it came many Western classical musicians. These musicians all made the same point: 'Indian music,' they said, 'is beautiful when we hear it with the dancers. On its own, it is repetitious and monotonous.'
