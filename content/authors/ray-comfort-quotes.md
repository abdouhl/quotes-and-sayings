- Faith is the first step to understanding. Either it's the Word of an infallible God, the fallible words of men, or faith in what you personally believe. You've got to have faith in something. Believe me.
- The more a nation gets into darkness, the more it's going to hate the light. The more it's going to run from the light. And we have a generation of people who have given themselves to darkness, and they've embraced atheism, because it gets them away from moral responsibility to God.
- In the past, missionaries have traveled to far countries with the message of the gospel - with great hardship and often with the loss of life. In contrast, we can reach millions instantly from the comfort of our homes by merely hitting the 'send' button on our computers, or with iPads, or phones.
- Most human beings have enough sense to know that if they work in a city that has a serious smog problem, it's wise to either stay indoors or at least wear a mask that will filter out the poison. But cigarette smokers have their own little concentrated toxic smog pack that they don't avoid.
- Even Helen Keller, who was born blind and deaf, could see God. No doubt, in her silent darkness, every fragrant flower, every ray of the warm sun, every taste that touched her tongue told her that there was a God who created all things. Jodie Foster shouldn't therefore be surprised that people are surprised that she's an atheist.
- Atheistic evolutionists believe that nothing created everything - a scientific impossibility. It couldn't happen. So they redefine the word 'nothing' to mean 'something,' so that in their unthinking minds, they can justify their foolishness.
- Each of us should think of the future. Every puff on a cigarette is another tick closer to a time bomb of terrible consequences. Christopher Hitchens didn't care about the consequences of smoking cigarettes. Tragically, he died of throat cancer in December 2011.
- I am surprised that anyone can profess to be an atheist.
- Hawking has violated the unspoken rules of atheism. He isn't supposed to use words like 'create' or even 'made.' They necessitate a Creator and a Maker. Neither are you supposed to let out that the essence of atheism is to believe that nothing created everything, because it's unthinking.
- Science is a wonderful discipline, to which we are deeply indebted.
- If you ask most atheists if the theory of evolution has anything to do with a belief, however, they will tell you that it doesn't. It's not something that has to be believed. It is a 'fact.'
- One of Dawkins' major gripes is against religion. I am in total agreement on that one. I abhor religion.
- The 'science' for which the United States is respected has nothing to do with the unscientific and baseless theory of evolution.
- It is true that you can't prove a negative. However, the existence of God is provable in the same way a building is positive proof that there was a builder.
- This society in which we live is radically changing. What previous generations saw as evil is now embraced as being good. It is a dangerous and slippery slope upon which we stand when we reject what Solomon called the beginning of wisdom - the fear of God.
- I cannot express to you how grateful I am that I am a Christian. Before I was a Christian, I went through a time in my life where I just didn't know why I was alive.
- You cannot have a creation without a Creator.
- All human beings are inherently good, so when someone goes off the rails, there must be some mitigating factor - he was bullied, was a loner, had an abusive father, or a domineering mother, etc.
- Sadly, I have found that even evolution's most staunch believers are afraid to debate, because they know that their case for atheism and evolution is less than extremely weak.
- I think the key to passion, to zeal, is gratitude. Or to put it another way, the fuel to motivate is gratitude, and gratitude comes by just backing up a little and realizing how much you've sinned against God.
- Every song has a composer, every book has an author, every car has a maker, every painting has a painter, and every building has a builder. So it isn't irrational to take this simple logic a little further and say that nature must have had a Maker. It would be irrational to believe that it made itself.
- It takes both courage and talent to stand up in front of fellow human beings and make them crack a smile, and at the same time keep it clean.
- Think of all the different features from Asian to African to Aboriginal to Caucasian. But we are all within the same species, Homo Sapiens.
- John Lennon was a musical genius. All I have to do is think of some of his songs and even the titles make me feel good... and I'm not the only one. His music has crossed cultures and even generations.
- George Harrison was known as the quiet Beatle. Quiet people are often quiet because they are deep thinkers.
- Creation is absolute, 100 percent scientific proof that there was a Creator.
- God doesn't believe in atheists.
- Only an unscientific ignoramus would hold to the thought that nothing created everything.
- Faith is as essential to the spiritual realm as oxygen is to the natural realm.
- Life cannot arise spontaneously but comes only from preexisting life.
- Evolution is unobservable. It's based on blind faith in a few dry bones and on unreliable dating systems in which the gullible trust. Kids should be allowed to make up their own minds about this issue, and not be censored to 'one side is all we will let you hear.'
- Most atheists bristle at the thought that atheism has anything to do with faith, but not Penn Jillette.
- Few would argue that Richard Dawkins is the world's most famous atheist, especially now that his friend and rival for the title, Christopher Hitchens, has now gone to meet his Maker.
- Atheistic evolution isn't an intelligent belief, as atheists would have the black community believe.
- An atheist is someone who thinks (but doesn't believe) that nothing created everything.
- Common sense says that if something possessed the ability to create itself from nothing, then that something wasn't nothing, it was something - a very intelligent creative power of some sort.

- According to the Law of Biogenesis, life arises only from preexisting life.
- The universe began in an instant, is expanding, and exhibits design, order, and complexity. Every effect must have a Cause, and design must have a Designer.
- According to the Law of Cause and Effect, every effect must have a cause. In other words, everything that happens has a catalyst; everything that came into being has something that caused it. Things don't just happen by themselves.
- The Gospel comes in power and the Holy Spirit, with much assurance. If you call upon the name of the Lord, God will transform you on the inside, give you the shock of your life, and give you everlasting life on top of that.
- Believing that there is no God does not mean that there isn't one.
- Imagine how wicked society would be if the fear of God and the fear of civil law were both completely removed.
- You may be ignorant of His presence at the time, but that doesn't mean He doesn't exist. If you look, you will find that He was there all along. You can know that God exists.

- Rhetoric, which is the use of language to inform or persuade, is very important in shaping public opinion. We are very easily fooled by language and how it is used by others.
