- The government is already into our lives a whole lot more than they should be. If I were president, I'd roll everything back. Everything!

- I'm a terrible trumpet player.
- I did recording sessions as a musician as well as a background vocalist and enjoyed every minute of it. I remember singing harmony with Waylon Jennings on a few songs that were hits. Chet Atkins always put me up so high that I strained to hit every note. It was a lot of fun.
- I saw Louis Armstrong perform at Albany State College on Radio Springs Road. He was probably the first famous individual I saw in concert. Unfortunately, I never did get to meet him.

- The human brain is a funny thing: it's very susceptible to tempo and melody. You put the right words to it, and it becomes very influential.
- I'm basically a keyboard player, so if it's got a keyboard on it, I'll give it a shot. I played a lot of organ in the early days. I can make a few chords on guitar, but that's about it.
