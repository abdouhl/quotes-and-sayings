- I love baking cakes and slices and biscuits, but I will only make them if I'm going somewhere with lots of people so I can share them around. I've got a sweet tooth, and I'm not good with discipline, so it's easier if I just don't have desserts in the house.
- Exercise is my relaxation. It's when I have some time to myself. I exercise every day.
- It's definitely something you have to learn: that you are going to be judged and scrutinised, but you have to decide how much you listen to and how much you let other people's opinions in.
- I was a fat kid. I can laugh now. But I got teased about being an Oompa Loompa and stuff like that.
- I think there are more Australians making it in Hollywood... we have a fantastic reputation for having a great work ethic.
- I think diets are ridiculous because eventually you have to stop, and then what? You put all the weight back on.
- I watched 'Hey Hey' religiously every Saturday night like every other single human that I knew.
- I don't drink soft drinks. I remember someone saying to me that having a soft drink with a meal is like having two meals.
- It's a bit daunting going into an industry that is very much based around your appearance. I just want to act; I don't care about that stuff. I hate that you need to think about it as much as you do to get work.
