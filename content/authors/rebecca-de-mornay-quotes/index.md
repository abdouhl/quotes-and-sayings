- Everything I thought about acting and having a movie career has changed from what I thought when I started.
- I just want to tell stories that have an impact on people. Somebody needs to have an impact because people are lost. People are really lost.
- I've never had a manager, and I've had various agents, and, fortunately or unfortunately, I've been blessed.

- I was so amazingly witty when I had the No. 1 movie, you have no idea. People laughed at every single one of my jokes. Then when I hadn't had a hit for three or four years, some of these same people pretended they didn't see me when I walked in the room.
- I think there's a knowingness in my face.

Which is trying to find a way to not let the insecurity of my profession get the better of me and make me crazy. I'm trying to find a way to maintain my own personal balance in the midst of everything.
