- I was a really pretentious teenager.
- As someone who works and travels as much, you could feel... A bit rootless?
- The kind of career that I want is not easy as a lady to manifest, because everyone wants a lady to be likable.
- One aspect of my mum's personality that has influenced me is her love of Hollywood and the golden era of black-and-white films.
- I've never been desperate to please my father.
- When I was 22, I thought I couldn't wear heels because of my height.
- I don't have regular TV; I have Apple TV, so I pick what I watch, which is perhaps not a good thing. I read all the big publications and also listen to a lot of podcasts.
- It's not like I particularly have an interest in creepiness for creepy's sake.
- I quite enjoy cooking but I'm not consistent. I can't follow the recipe book. If something goes well, I'll never make it again, which is completely stupid. It's a one-shot kind of deal.
- It's so great that women are being allowed to be heroes in big things.
- If I got too famous, I'd just quit acting, but I think it's highly unlikely I'm going to get really famous.
- I've played an awful lot of repressed people.
- I want to try to make difficult people somehow relatable.
- I think it's a bit short-sighted to play any character and not explore, in some respects, the way they act when things get really bad.
- This is how much of a music geek I am: if I have a day with nothing to do, one of my favourite things is to just sit at my computer and make playlists of pretty much anything.
- I don't think that anyone can really understand anything until it's understood on a cellular, emotional level.
- Yes, I'm a complete itinerant. I keep making attempts not to be, but then circumstances make me uproot and go somewhere else again. It's not the worst thing in the world at all; I love it. In fact, I'm probably horribly addicted to it.
- I think I have a job, which is to present a character in a story and entertain you and divert you with my work - that's it.
- There's so much crap attached to acting: the fame aspect, the ego aspect, the 'Am I good, am I bad, am I being judged, who likes me, who doesn't like me...'
- The kind of films I want to make are struggling to get made. And if they are getting made, they're getting made on shoestring budgets with not enough time.
- I was quite quiet as a kid. I sat around watching people.
- When you work with filmmakers, and it's their first film, there's an exuberance and optimism, which is quite... There's no room for being jaded. Thinking that you know it all.
- The voice is always the starting place for me with a character.
- I used to have the most visceral response to having my photo taken. I felt like instantly bursting into tears and running out of the room. I hated all the attention, which is such a stupid thing for an actor to say.
- Your principal motive on a movie set is to get the film made, but on a Woody Allen set, there's an ulterior thing that goes on, which is, 'Did you have a conversation with Woody? How friendly have you been with him? Am I liked by him?'
- In high drama or high tragedy or anything, it's not really human unless there's some humor at the same time. And vice versa. So I guess I tend to gravitate towards projects which tread a dodgy tightrope between two things, which aren't really one or another.
- I've worked on so many films where the script is one thing and then, somewhere down the line - on set, sometimes - it changes, and there's zero I can do about it.
- I grew up watching his movies; I know everyone did, but I really feel that a lot of my formative years were informed by Woody Allen films.
- Since 'Christine' started screening, I'm overwhelmed by the response from women and men - that it's so rare to see something like this. We're just not given the opportunity so much.
- There are a lot of movies about misfits that are quite cool, that kind of glamorize it on some level. I think there are fewer films, certainly with a lady at the center, about the agony of what it's like to feel like you're not accepted, and you're different, and somehow you're weird.
- I was the kid that grew up watching Bette Davis films.
- I don't believe that all actors should end up being directors.
- I've been listening to 'Chapo Trap House' - they're quite radical. Every time I listen to it, my brain feels opened up.
- If you act scared, your body produces adrenaline.
- As a child I loved ghost stories.
- Some of my acting heroes have built careers on playing characters who do horrendous things - they're repellent and lovable. They're not likable, but they're lovable. I think Christine is one of those characters.
- I read everything. I've always got a book on the go and I'm really nerdy about it, I get through books and don't remember anything about them afterwards. But I read all sorts, from classic to contemporary.
- I really think that 'Christine' is one in a million in terms of independent or studio.
- I've always had horrible Valentine's Days.
- My friends have noticed that if I suddenly go through a couple of months' unemployment, there seems to be a correlation that I don't ever tend to wear the same outfit twice. There will be such strange combinations of clothes because I'm probably a bit creatively stifled, so it's coming out in my wardrobe.
- A lot of people go through life trying to perform normalcy, and I think you can relate to that.
- It's one thing to think about something, but it's another thing to actually feel it.
- 'Twin Peaks' is my favorite American TV show.
- Nobody engages in a film, regardless of what your job is in it, to make a bad one.
- My mum's American. She's from Detroit.
- You sit there, and you argue and you argue, and you sort of bully the hell out of the text until you're quite sure what it's revealing, and then you perform it.
- If I'm going to be honest about it, I think men get to do this sort of thing all the time. You look at countless performances by great male actors who get to play the whole gamut of human emotions. Women aren't regularly allowed to do that, and I don't know why people are so frightened by it.
- If pressed, I would say I feel British. It's where I grew up and where I choose to live, the culture that I love, but I feel perfectly at home in America, I don't feel like a tourist or anything.
- The last thing that scared me... it was probably something stupid, like when someone jumped out at me, or I thought my new dog had gone to the toilet underneath my piano. Lots of silly things.
- I don't think I can boast about him. 'Hey, my dad is a British institution; he's done all these incredible things and I'm really proud of him.' There is a certain baggage that comes with that in England.
- To read a character I'm not sympathizing with is generally quite a good, attractive proposition because I've got somewhere to go, I've got work to do, to try to understand why they behave like they behave, to relate entirely and understand them and to be completely emotionally connected. That is much more fun 99 percent of the time.
- Anyone who commits an act of violence to themselves or others is worth consideration in the sense that there must be something that brought them to that point, whether it's a mental health issue or otherwise.
- I don't know how you make a living without a few personal compromises.
- We all relate to having highs and lows. Everyone gets depressed.
- I love the solitary, romantic idea of writing.
- You have to start from a place of trying to create a character.
- Shopping is a bit of a relaxing hobby for me, which is sometimes troubling for the bank balance.
- There's always going to be a separate version of you that people will create, and you have no control over it.
- I thought there was something intrinsically fascinating about people who communicate for a living and are incapable of communicating in their personal lives.
- It's so rare that I get to do something in my own accent in my own hometown.
- There is no way of knowing if a film is going to be good.
- I love being able to express myself through what I wear - and for it to be a way of expressing uniqueness and individuality.
- Some people just don't have the tools to deal with the stuff life throws at them.
- I think that female roles, they can be victims, they can be sympathetic, they can be in pain, they can be in suffering - but they can't be ugly. I think there's so much fear surrounding that, that it makes a film unlikeable, that it won't sell.
- Directors assume I'm, like, establishment.
- There are people all over the world who like to write fan letters in the voice of their pet: 'Hello, my name is Fifi and I'm a labrador and I think you're great. Paw paw!'
- We can't constantly tell stories of heroes. We have to hear the other stories, too, about people in dire straits who make bad choices.
- I've just started to get really envious when I go into people's houses and see books on a shelf.
- I don't want to constantly be making sacrifices. It feels like it's really difficult for the films I dream about making to turn up.
- I love clothes. I've never actively followed trends, but I definitely know what I like and what I don't like. I think fashion is a really important and empowering thing. I don't think it's superficial, actually, I think it's very important.
- I don't think it's helpful to put them all in a box and say people are evil and freaks because they have gotten to the point where they have fallen out of the community of what it is to be a human being. That's worthy of investigation.
- I'm a bit nerdy about accents. I love it.
- I did 'Iron Man' because I was curious about those massive movies that were taking over the summers every year, and I wanted to see what the fuss was about.
- For better or worse, I don't necessarily categorize myself as a method actor; I'm not going to make claims that I stayed in character 24/7.
- I'm not consciously avoiding doing a lot of period drama, but I don't really seek it out either.
- I can't remember a time when I didn't want to be an actor. It has just always been an inevitability on some level.
- At some point, you have to be willing to accept other people's opinions. I think that's helpful.
- Lentil dhal is the only thing I can cook.
- My access point to the '70s is films from that time, and they all have that paranoiac quality.
- You either are a good director or you're not.
- I don't like talking about myself, if I'm honest.
- If I could be a musician, I'd do it. I love singing.
- I felt very fulfilled after doing 'Vicky Cristina Barcelona' because I'd always wanted to work with Woody Allen. That was like a lifelong dream, and that was thrilling for me, to enter that world.
- It doesn't matter how much polite self-deprecating fluff you have on the outside if you don't have a steely something in the middle that says, 'You know what, I'm actually really, really good at this, and this is what I can do, and I'm going to do it.'
- I don't think that theater is the higher medium, that it's better than film.
- If you imagine yourself to be someone who is very uncomfortable in their own skin, then it does funny things to your voice.
- I'm a very private person. I barely tell my friends what's going on half the time, so the idea that I should then talk to the world about what is going on seems anathema to me. People can say what they want. I'm not going to change anyone's mind.
- I always look for contradiction in a character.
- Steven Spielberg was a huge part of my childhood, like everyone's, I guess.
- If I sat around thinking about acting all day, I'd lose my mind.
- I was a sort of New York intellectual when I was 16. I wanted to dress like Annie Hall when I was 18.
- I would say that maybe directors who act as well are easier with actors. I'm not saying that all directors have this, but sometimes you'll come across a director who sort of looks at an actor a bit like a kind of untrained horse that's been let out of the stable, like they might buck him.
- Whenever I'm in theatre situations I will go out of my way not to talk about my father, but in the film world I can be really proud of my family and say, 'You know what: my dad's a really, really famous theatre director,' because nobody has any idea.
- It sounds trite, but I like telling stories.
- My childhood was very colourful, and I am very good friends with both my parents. We have no secrets.
- Even if the film doesn't come out quite as you'd hoped, the process can also be very rewarding. I feel that way about a film called 'Lay the Favorite' that I made with Stephen Frears. I did that because the character was a real leap for me. The film doesn't quite all add up internally, but I feel very proud of what I did on it.
- I think acting can be very frustrating, and there's no experience that doesn't make you a better actor.
- One of the great things about the 'Iron Man' franchise is that they employ fascinating actors who don't necessarily do action movies. Before 'Iron Man' you didn't associate Robert Downey, Jr. and Gwyneth Paltrow with those kinds of films. There's an emphasis on repartee and wit.
- I think for a long time it seemed like working in an art form and being a feminist meant portraying women in a perfect, angelic light. And there's nothing feminist about that.
- I'm very nerdy about my music, and I like interrogating people about what they put on playlists.
