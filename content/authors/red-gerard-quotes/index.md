- It's so hard to look at someone doing a triple cork when you're 7 years old, and them saying, 'I want to go do that.' It's not really relatable at all. So, if I can somehow make it so kids want to get into snowboarding, that's special.
- I'm not used to waking up early at all.
- It's super cool becoming friends with people from other countries because you can get their Snapchat and talk to them.
- I have the same attitude going into every contest. It's all the same.
- We'd go to the crappiest mountain because they had the cheapest lift tickets.

- I try not to think too far into the future; I'm kind of a day-by-day kind of guy.
- I kind of just treat every contest like a normal day.
- I kind of grew up just watching Dew Tour and X-Games.
- I won the Olympics. This is a dream, dude.
