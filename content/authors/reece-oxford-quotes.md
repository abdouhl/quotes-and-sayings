- Everyone focuses in football now on the managers a bit more than the players. I think that's a bad thing.
- I just try not to be at the centre of everything.
- Everyone just needs to be together. That's what you need. You don't just need a manager but a team that is together.
- I hope I'm going to be a good player, but you never know. Hopefully I can just get game time and play, and prove to everyone.
- Every year there is a lot of hype around players from England saying they are going to be the next this or that. Sometimes they fade away, sometimes they move on.
- If the Under-21s or the Under-18s need me I still come down and play without making a fuss. I don't mind playing for whatever age group. I am with the first team now but if they want me to play, I will play.
- At my last Under-23s game I heard Reading were interested. I knew I had to push for that deal with a top three club fighting for promotion.
- I've said this before - Marcus Edwards. My age - he's probably one of the best players I've played with.
- I had a few teams after me, but when I heard Reading were interested I didn't think about other teams.
- I was just happy to be in and around the team, being in the 16, being in and around a Premier League team. I got nine games, I came on a couple of times in the Prem, a couple of times in the cup games.
