- Broadcast TV is like the landline of 20 years ago.
- Well, we're about 24 million subscribers today, and that's up from about 15 million a year ago, so it's a very high rate of growth, and that's what's exciting about the business - more and more people are getting smart TVs, they're watching Netflix on their iPads.
- We are seeing the beginning of things. Web 2.0 is broadband. Web 3.0 is 10 gigabits a second.

- I hate the photo shoots.
- On the Internet you get continuous innovation, so every year the streams are a little better.

- In fact, technology has been the story of human progress from as long back as we know. In 100 years people will look back on now and say, 'That was the Internet Age.' And computers will be seen as a mere ingredient to the Internet Age.
- It is clear that for many of our members two websites would make things more difficult, so we are going to keep Netflix as one place to go for streaming and DVDs.
- Comparing Apple to Netflix is like comparing apples to oranges, especially if the oranges made so many mistakes that people stopped eating oranges and just went back to Blockbuster.
- Stone Age. Bronze Age. Iron Age. We define entire epics of humanity by the technology they use.
- There's a finite market for DVD-by-mail, and the growth over the next 10 years will be in streaming.
- How much has it been your experience that Americans follow what happens in the world?
- There is a revolution happening, and within two years I think that Wi-Fi and Netflix will be built into all the televisions.
- Most entrepreneurial ideas will sound crazy, stupid and uneconomic, and then they'll turn out to be right.
- School districts in the US don't adopt technology very quickly.
- But as an entrepreneur you have to feel like you can jump out of an aeroplane because you're confident that you'll catch a bird flying by. It's an act of stupidity, and most entrepreneurs go splat because the bird doesn't come by, but a few times it does.
- I don't know of any Internet service that opens on a regional basis.
- Most companies that are great at something - like AOL dialup or Borders bookstores - do not become great at new things people want (streaming for us) because they are afraid to hurt their initial business.
- Our brand at Netflix is really focused on movies and TV shows.
- Great leaders, like Steve Jobs or Jeff Bezos, also focused on the long term.
- In the States, there's ESPN3, and each country has different options, and other than premiere league football, there tends to be very little global content. And movie and TV rights are pretty broad content.

- At Netflix, we think you have to build a sense of responsibility where people care about the enterprise. Hard work, like long hours at the office, doesn't matter as much to us. We care about great work.
- I'm on the Facebook board now. Little did they know that I thought Facebook was really stupid when I first heard about it back in 2005.
- I watch mostly independent films.
- I'm an HBO subscriber, and I watch a bunch of great shows on HBO.
- We have a very wide range of content, but the brand-newest movies, what's happening with those is a $30 pay-per-view option - not from Netflix but from DirecTV and others - of movies that are in the theater.
- In hindsight, I slid into arrogance based upon past success.
- I've worked very hard, but my life's always been fun.
