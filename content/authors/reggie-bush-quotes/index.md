- I'm a sports fan. I'm not just an athlete who plays football.
- I always idolized guys like Deion Sanders, Barry Sanders, Steve Young and the entire 49ers team, really. I was a huge 49ers fan growing up.
- I play football, and most football players are camera shy. We just want to be left alone; we just want to stick to what we do.
- I want the Saints to be one of those teams where when other teams see us on the schedule, they know they're in for one hell of a game.
- Hmm, the best thing about being in the NFL? In America it's the No.1 sport; it's exciting, fun, so to me the best thing is the buzz that surrounds football on and off the field.
- I've always been a big PlayStation fan. Even when the Xbox first came out, I stuck with the PlayStation. I think it's because when the Xbox first came out, the controller was so different that you just automatically assumed that it was harder to play, and I always just stuck with that notion.
- I like rugby - I watch it from time to time. It's basically football without pads but probably a little bit more dangerous than football. You've got to be a lot tougher in that sport - but I definitely like watching rugby and watching those guys knock each other around. It looks like a fun sport.
- It's amazing to be able to play the sport that I grew up loving so much and that I have a strong passion for. I'm just having a ball. There's a lot of pressure that comes with being in the spotlight and being a superstar and a role model, but I'm enjoying it.
- When you join the NFL, you start from scratch. As long as I've been playing - which has been since I was eight years old - the game becomes harder at every level. Little league, high school, college - they're different stages you have to go through, and professional sport is completely different again.
