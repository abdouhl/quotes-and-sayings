- As long as I can remember, I've always had pets. Something about the connection you share with this entirely different species just blows my mind.
- Everything that Michael Fassbender touches is elevated.
- It's so fun to just slip on different hats and play different characters, even if it's just for a minute.
- Whether it's soundtracking a moment in my life or just motivating me to hit the gym, I constantly have music playing. Even if it's just in my head.
- I consider myself almost a Californian at this point, because I've been here long enough. Obviously, when I first came to the land of blond-haired, blue-eyed surfer types, I was the sardonic, sarcastic, liquor-swilling, chain-smoking, dark-haired, dark-eyed guy from New York.
- I am very lucky that I get to go to work and laugh all day for my day job, and then go home and torture my artistic self.
- One time, just passing by, I happened to see Jack White from the White Stripes. I'm a huge White Stripes fan, and I did a whole 180. It was like my jaw hit the ground.
- I try not to read reviews. It's hard not to hear what the critics are saying, but as an actor, I try not to let it in and to just give the best performances I can. At the end of the day, if you're trying to please the critics, you're missing what's really important: being creative and having fun.
- I actually started as a director, but then I saw Mark Ruffalo in 'You Can Count on Me,' and I thought to myself, 'I want to do that.'
- Pilot season can be maddening. You're basically putting yourself and your talent out there to be scrutinized several times a day for months by network executives who have probably never acted in anything since their junior high school production of 'The Wiz.'
- I've always been a big fan of 'Law & Order: SVU.' I think Mariska Hargitay and Chris Meloni are just incredible.
- Honestly, my biggest education regarding improv comedy actually came on the job working for 'My Boys.'
- Twitter's been interesting. I'm kind of a tech geek, but I've never been a Facebook or Twitter guy. Surprisingly, I've really enjoyed Twitter because I get to connect with fans.
- You've got to have confidence and trust in your cast. You have to have confidence and trust in your director, in your editor. It's such a team effort; I really think you have to pull yourself out of it and just trust. I think the number one thing you can do is just trust everyone around you.
- I'd taken some classes at UCB in New York and again at the Magnet Theater and the PIT Theater. I definitely never advanced to where I was on a team or anything like that.
- You're using such different muscles and you rely on physicality in live action, but in animation, you totally throw that out the window. But somehow, they're both as satisfying.
- I ski, I surf, I scuba dive... any sport that starts with an 's.'
- Nothing is better than showing up twice a week, acting like a 12 year-old for two hours, and then going home.
- I always go for 'SPIN' magazine because I'm such a music buff.
- I'll always come back to comedy. Doing drama can feel satisfying, but day to day, it's just not as fun as laughing.
- I like comfy feet. If I'm not barefoot, you'll probably find me with a pair of New Balance on.
- 'Sound of My Voice' is an amazing film. Small, simple, yet incredibly thought provoking.
- I love 'The Americans.' I think it's one of the best shows on TV.
- As a layperson, I consider myself fairly well-educated in terms of politics. My family always has been really interested in politics, and various members of my family have a hand in politics in upstate New York.
- If I'm not barefoot, you'll probably find me with a pair of New Balance on. And I'm not one of those hipster-jump-on-the-band-wagon-ironically-cool NB fans. I've been rocking those kicks since they were true nerd shoes. Since the '80s, yo! Word.
- Obviously, when I first came to the land of blond-haired, blue-eyed surfer types, I was the sardonic, sarcastic, liquor-swilling, chain-smoking, dark-haired, dark-eyed guy from New York.
- My personal style falls between casual cool and meticulous slob. I'm most comfortable in jeans, but I love fashion.
- Acting is reacting. You can't react if you're not paying attention, if you're not listening.
- I have some friends who have been living in the political world for some time now. It's a lot of robbing Peter to pay Paul. If you've got something you want, and that person who has it wants something in return, it quite literally becomes your job to find whatever it is that they want.
- I guess my favorite Web site would be theonion.com. I used to read that paper all the time in New York, and it still cracks me up. It's actually my homepage on my computer.
- The secret to my 5 o'clock shadow is a little device called the George Michael 3000 Custom Beard Trimmer and Personal Massager. Just kidding. I actually shave every morning, and thanks to my vast knowledge of Eastern philosophy and mysticism, I will my facial hair to grow to the exact same length each day. Dave Grohl taught me that one.
- To me, Cary Grant is probably the most fashionable man in the history of Hollywood. The guy was just slick. He did it so effortlessly.
- Since I was a kid, music has been a huge part of my life. My parents had a pretty solid vinyl collection and exposed me to some amazing artists.
- I've been a diehard fan of 'The Simpsons' since I was a kid.
- The more cerebral, slightly darker comedy stuff is where I love to live.
- I intend to act forever if I can.
- I've got to say, I enjoy a good suit. Something about a really well-tailored suit; I like it.
- We've got to get off oil. And it's possible. It'll take a dramatic shift in the way we think and how our infrastructure works, but we as Americans have proven time and again that we can tackle change head on. Yeah, it's a challenge, but it doesn't have to be a painful one. We just have to recalibrate our thinking on the subject.
- I'm an avid reader. Novels, non-fiction, comics, it doesn't matter. Best way in the world to feed your head.
