- People don't like reality, they like crazy stories.
- Adventure has to do with private, personal experiences. But, the possibilities, there are millions of unclimbed mountains - I have seen in the Eastern part of Tibet, mountains 6,000-6,500 meters high, vertical walls twice as tall as the Eiger... but nobody is going there, because they aren't 8,000-meter peaks.
- For me, imagination is more important in climbing than muscle or daredevil antics.
- An account of an expedition is not a novel. Therefore an authentic account can never be given, let alone written down by someone who was not present.
- I am not made for lonely expeditions. In the sixties, I climbed during the day so I wouldn't have to be alone. I finally learned to stay up for weeks in the high altitude all by my own without being afraid.
- Mountaineering is over. Alpinism is dead. Maybe its spirit is still alive a little in Britain and America, but it will soon die out.
- The Slovenians are the very best climbers in the world.
- Traditional alpinism is to go where the others are not going and to be self-reliant.
- When I was a small child, I began on small mountains. Now, as I am getting older, the small peaks are getting bigger. If I am lucky, some day I will end on a small peak.
- To me, it's just not that important whether someone climbs the Eigerwand in ten hours or in three.
- I can't tell people to love mountains. They have to find their own way.
- Albert Frederick Mummery and Chris Bonington are the British climbers I most admire.
- I would never bring a flag on the summit. If somebody is climbing for a country he is not normal, he is sick.
- The true alpinist doesn't want any infrastructure, he wants to go into the wild. And the odds of getting killed there are relatively high. And most people are sensible enough not to want that.
- I am not so famous. I'm known in a few countries like Italy, Austria, Germany, Switzerland and around the Alps. Some climbers in Beijing know my name, and some in America, but I am not really famous. It's very relative, my fame.
- A 30-year-old rock climber is an old man. At 40, one is in the middle of his high-altitude power. At 50, a crosser of deserts is at his best age. But at 60, each of us is out of the game.
- I became famous for the fact that I would break many, many limits. People said, 'He does all these crazy things.' But oddly it was a crazy thing only because scientists and climbers said, 'Everest and the 8,000-meter peaks without oxygen - impossible. Messner is becoming sick in his head.'
- Climbing is not a competition, and you cannot talk in terms of 'greatest,' it means nothing.
- I am my own home, and my handkerchief is my flag.
- There are three elements of mountaineering - difficulty, danger, and exposure. Difficulty is the technical aspect of it. Danger, it is best to avoid, but some people like to increase danger to a point where their success is dependent only on luck. And exposure, which is what truly defines Alpinism, is what you face in wild nature.
- I'm a rock climber, a high-altitude climber, an adventurer, a storyteller through my museums, and a writer of more than 50 books.
- The cliches that circulate in the German media about Joachim Sauer are a total fallacy. The fact is that he's his own man. He's witty, he's profound, he can be incredibly funny, and he's an extremely bright guy.
- The best climbers no longer go to the 8000ers, but to the most difficult mountains in the world which are 6000 or 7000-meter-peaks. There they find any kind of playground. But it is a pity that the really good climbers have fewer opportunities to finance their expeditions because so much attention is taken away by the Everest tourists.
- I am not so proud to climb all the 8,000-meter peaks, but I was proud to climb Nanga Parbat solo. That was the most elegant thing I did.
- Alpinism means you go by yourself with your own responsibility, knowing that you could die. But Everest now is more like ski tourism: preparing the piste, helping people go up, setting oxygen bottles near the summit.
- I was always at my best when I was learning, when I was curious. When I had yet to see past the next horizon.
- I left many different mountains but always the gods gave me a chance to go back. I was always going with a quiet foot.
- There are periods on the mountain when you exist between living and dying, sometimes for days. I went through that with my brother on Nanga Parbat. It is very difficult, but it is the most intense experience. And always after such experiences, when I was back among people, I felt I had been reborn.
- Crossing the Gobi was a real milestone for me.
- I produce schnapps on my farm but I'm not fond of drinking it.
- I was the first man to climb the world's 14 tallest peaks without supplementary oxygen, but I never asked how high I would go, just how I would do it.
- A good expedition doesn't need a leader at all. You are deciding day by day, discussing it in a democratic way.
- When I held in my hands the remains of Gunther, I had a strong feeling, like a phantom pain of an amputee.
- There is no joy involved in climbing mountains, there is simply the challenge, the self-invented challenge, the play.
- I started the whole 'Into Thin Air' thing - nothing I'm proud of.
- The Dolomites are the most beautiful rock mountains in the world, but in a few million years they will just be desert.
- Ueli Steck, I'm absolutely certain, had a very strong inner drive to keep pushing. He set very high standards for himself.
- A tourist follows a trail; a mountaineer finds one.
- I have always said that a mountain without danger is not a mountain.
- This is one of my definitions of mountaineering: to go where others do not.
- In the West, the art of rock climbing is growing because it has to do with less risk, good muscles. But the people seeking high goals in high places are in Eastern Europe, and they reach their goals because they are willing to suffer more.
- The only possibility to have a knowledge of both the Earth's nature and our own internal nature is through traditional climbing when you go on your own, far from safety, and encounter the unknown.
- My brother is in me. When we remember somebody else, in a certain way they are still alive. I see my brother - he is still young - looking to the Dolomites where we did our ascents. I remember those moments, so he is still together with me.
- I was first to understand it was boring to go with heavy shoes to base camp. When we first tried Dhaulagiri, a very difficult approach at high altitude, we needed very heavy boots. So it was usual to wear such heavy boots to approach all base camps. But I thought this was crazy. We needed lighter shoes for many of the approaches.
- I think my cultural work is more important than the adventures I did. The adventures are not important for human beings. It's the conquering of the useless.
- I like Nietzsche. I quote him in many of my books. He was born 100 years before me.
- Once you lose your credibility, you can never restore it.
- On your own, relying on yourself, you will never feel you are stronger than the mountain, and your respect for the peak grows.
- Gunther and I always shared the work. Each of us carried his own sleeping bag and tent, and porters carried the rest, until the highest camp, when we were on our own. Nobody helped us up there.
- I have the feeling that behind a certain dimension we cannot anymore see, understand, feel, smell, hear - nothing. What people are calling God I am not defining, but I am a 'possibilitiest.'
- Out of all the climbers of this generation, I was the one who became known to the larger public. Many of them - not all of them, but many of them - understood they had only one chance to use me for their personal gain. And it's very easy to use me.
- I go to the mountains for an adventure and each time I pray I will get up and down again.
- I'm a storyteller. I do this for the next generations. They have to know what traditional alpinism is all about.
- Anyone who ever witnessed Ueli Steck flying up the Eigerwand would know that he was always in control of his actions. He was always moving with immense precision and a sense of safety.
- I had no ghost writers for the books - I wrote every line myself.
- On Mount Everest it feels as if you are in the womb, but on K2 you are always out on the edge.
- First, I am afraid to die and I love to live. But an adventure is only an adventure when there is the threat of dying.
- I am a South Tyrolean. I identify with this land.
- My father had been a Wehrmacht officer in the second world war and was a violent and damaged man.
- I go to the wild mountains where I am responsible for myself. Step by step I am making sure that I don't die.
- I learned to ski in the Dolomites at the age of five. Ski lifts didn't exist then, so I did everything on foot.
- The mountains are dangerous. Only an unintelligent person will say they are not dangerous.
- In politics, you have to compromise from morning to evening. Democracy is the art of compromise.
- Climbing is all about freedom, the freedom to go beyond all the rules and take a chance, to experience something new, to gain insight into human nature.
- Climbing is more of an art than a sport. It's the aesthetics of a mountain that compels me. The line of a route, the style of ascent. It is creative.
- The art of climbing is the art of survival. The best climber is the man or woman going in the most crazy places but surviving.
- I have been in the most dangerous of places just in order to survive. An intelligent man would stay in a safe place to survive.
- Climbing has so much more culture than all other activities put together. There is no culture in tennis, just a few names, a few dates. No big culture in soccer. But we have thousands of books, great philosophers, thinkers, painters.
- For me, climbing has always been about adventure and that involves difficulties, danger and exposure, so I deliberately set out to climb with as little equipment as possible.
- Ninety per cent of the tourists climbing big mountains are on 10 mountains - and one million mountains in the world are empty.
- Mountains are not fair or unfair - they are dangerous.
- By climbing mountains we were not learning how big we were. We were finding out how breakable, how weak and how full of fear we are.
- The art of climbing is to go where you go knowing that you could die, but you don't die. That is adventure.
- In climbing there is no question of right or wrong. Moral right or wrong, that is a religious question, they have nothing to do with anarchical activity, and classical mountaineering is a completely anarchical activity.
- In my state of spiritual abstraction, I no longer belong to myself and to my eyesight. I am nothing more than a single narrow gasping lung, floating over the mists and summits.
- Around half of the top alpinists have died climbing. Of course if I'm careful and turn back more often than the others, I can increase my chances of survival. But if I hadn't been lucky a few times, I wouldn't be here.
- At 30 I was not quiet enough inside myself. At 40 I was not rich enough. At 50 I was still hoping to change the world.
- All nationalism is dangerous; all religions are dangerous.
- For years I was a rock climber and nothing else. I went to school, yes, and university, yes, but in my heart I was a rock climber.
- In mountaineering, there is not only the activity, but the philosophy behind it. Some say a moral, but I am against that because all morality is dangerous.
- All the Yeti footprints are all the same bear. The Yeti isn't a fantastic figure. The Yeti is reality.
- I learned a lot from more experienced mountaineers, such as Peter Habeler, but by the time I was about 21 I reckoned I had learned all that I needed to make me technically self-sufficient anywhere.
- Fame is very heavy. When there are large crowds, I'm unable to handle it.
- Before kids, I was really going to the limit. Afterwards, I was approaching the limit but then maybe turning around.
- Look, I do not control alpinism. But maybe I was too successful. Many in the mountaineering scene - journalists, second-rate climbers, lecturers, so-called historians - had a problem with me for many years.
- My aim is not just to help preserve what is left of mountain life, but to create a centre where people can study and learn about it.
- I am not an anarchist, but I am anarchistical.
- Each mountain in the Dolomites is like a piece of art.
- I want to look into the dark spaces in people's souls. At what happens to us when we go to the mountains.
- I have a very different fear if I'm all alone in the summit area of Mount Everest and if I know that there is nothing below me, no Sherpa, no tent, no rope.
- Traditional alpinism is slowly disappearing. It is becoming sport, indoors on small walls with holds where you cannot really fall.
- Every week someone rings me up wanting to open a new Messner museum, but I'm not interested.
- William Blake said 200 years ago that when man and mountains meet, something big is happening. I'm searching for the 'big.'
- When I lost seven of my toes on Nanga Parbat and small parts of my fingertips I knew I'd never be a great rock climber. So I specialized in high-altitude climbing.
- The museum at Ortles is dedicated to the world of ice so we wanted visitors to feel like they were inside a glacier.
- I was 5 when I went up my first 10,000 ft mountain, with my parents, and I have been climbing ever since.
- For me the Everest solo was the icing on the cake of my climbs: the highest mountain in the world, during a monsoon, and as far as possible even on a new route, of course without oxygen.
- My father blamed me for my brother Gunther's death, for not bringing him home. He died in an avalanche as we descended from the summit of Nanga Parbat, one of the 14 peaks over 8,000m, in 1970. Gunther and I did so much together. It was difficult for my father to understand what it was like up there.
- I am responsible for my brother's death. I feel the guilt of having survived. People say, 'You should be happy. You survived.' But I have this feeling that it is not right that I am alive.
- Life is about daring to carry out your ideas. And for me, it always comes back to the wilderness, nature, mountains.
