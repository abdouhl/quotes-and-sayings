- I'm almost positive I have some type of PTSD. Almost a decade of my life was consumed by the prison system.
- I stopped going to high school when I met Big Pun, which wasn't the smartest thing. So I never got my diploma. When I went to prison, it's mandatory to get your GED if you don't have a high school diploma.
- We have all these politicians that claim they're pro-life and that say women should not be able to get abortions and all this other stuff... there's nothing more pro-life than helping a woman who wants to have a child have a child. Then I realized that health insurance doesn't cover IVF.
- I think once you know who your man is, and you know his wants and his desires and things like that, and you let him play his position, everything else is just gonna fall into place.
- I think I'm the greatest chick in the game, and I expect all the others to feel the same way. If not, you're in the wrong profession.
- You have to find a man that's going to respect you. With my husband, I tell him all the time the fact that he grew up in a home with his mom and his dad and they were married until he was grown made him have certain values and certain respect for me.
- I hated women before I went to prison. I always felt like women were trying to tear each other down.
- I'll talk all this craziness in my music, but when I have your attention, and you're listening to me, I'll talk about what I want to talk about and what I think we need to address.
- People are trying to act like they're balling all day with cars, their house, like there's no problems. I feel like a lot of people are trying to be someone they're not, and when you're just yourself, life is so much easier because you don't have to keep up this facade.
- I like sharing my family with my fans, but my son hates it. Like, I am literally blocked on all his social media.
- You have to know your man. Girls be like, 'I know my man, I know my man,' but I mean really know him.
- I'm kinda secretive, and I can't even say secretive because of my son. He's the type, like, he doesn't let his friends know who his mom is or his stepdad. He doesn't like me going to his school. If he gets into trouble at school, he's, like, dying. He's very low-key with it. He's always been like that since he was born.
- The song 'Conceited' on 'There's Something About Remy' was inspired by people always telling me that I'm so much prettier in person or that I've lost so much weight since they saw me on TV. I don't even know if that's a compliment. Were you watching me on TV thinking I was ugly?
- People know that I'm very outspoken. I've learned that when I talk, it usually comes off very aggressive. It's not that I'm aggressive - I'm very stern.
- I couldn't tell you what was my last performance before I was incarcerated. I couldn't tell you what last meal I had, or anything of those things because I didn't think about it; it wasn't important to me. I think about it now. I can tell you everything I ate for the past week. I think that alone makes me a better person.
- Whenever I've had a problem with any female in this entire game, I will say your name... I'm going to say your government. I'm going to look it up. I'm going to say your mother's name, your father's name, your kid's name. I want you to know that I'm talking about you.
- I didn't have any look or any style in prison. Your footwear couldn't cost more than $50. You can't wear blue, orange, gray, any patterns, or you couldn't wear your hair down. There were just so many rules that coincided with your attire.
- I was always really smart in school. My whole family is smart. We have 'Jeopardy' challenges and have Scrabble tournaments.
- When women are trying to keep a man, just make sure it's a man that you want to keep. You know, he might be cute and drives this type of vehicle and has a nice little bank account, but is he really somebody that you would want?
- Nah, I'm not one of those 'hip-hop is dead' people. I just like different artists. I never look at it as one entity. I've always felt like that.
- People are always jumping at what's new - who's the next person, who's the hottest thing, or whatever - so to be able to grasp the attention of everybody is difficult.
- Everything used to get under my skin, and now I'll just be like, 'That's life.' I'm so much more unbothered.
- I took all my blessings for granted. The fact that God has given me another chance to do what I love to do, and still have my husband and my children and my sanity and good people in my corner, I'm gonna do it right this time and show that I appreciate it.
- I never was a person that said, 'I'm gonna be a rapper.' I thought I would be a doctor. I just knew how to rap, and it was a cool thing to do, so I started doing it for fun.
- When you go to prison, you don't feel like a superstar. It really humbles you as a person.
