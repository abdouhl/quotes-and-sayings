- Social media can be very negative at times.
- I like being me and portraying myself in a certain way that makes me feel comfortable and confident.
- If I can be the champion of NXT I don't even know how to put it into words. It would be so humbling and appreciative, but also I would prove to everyone why I should be NXT Women's Champion.
- Having people like Triple H and Shawn Michaels at the performance center, it's just insane.
- Training with only girls is good and beneficial because we work with each other and there is no intergender in WWE.
- The tattoos on my legs started because they didn't let me get tattoos on my upper body at work. They would never clear me for anything.

- Music does help me a lot with my character, with the fact that I have to have a really good theme song, something that I can get into while I'm walking down the ramp. It puts me into that mindset that I'm going into a mosh pit.
- We're not the characters that we portray online, and even if we are, we're a 10-time version of ourselves. That's still not us. Most of the things we do, we wouldn't do in person.

- Triple H is someone I've looked up to since I was a little girl.
- Going into work and seeing Shawn Michaels - someone I watched growing up - how many people can say that? That they get to see people like Shawn Michaels at work and that they get to learn off Shawn Michaels. To me that's insane.

- My work ethic is don't stop until you reach the top pretty much and I put in dedication every single day of my life, I'm glad it's paying off.

- At home, I think the largest crowd I ever wrestled was in front of 500 people.
- I love Hot Topic, it's like my No. 1 store.

- I just wish that people were kinder.
- With the first Mae Young Classic, I was very young. I was 20.
- At the end of the day we're humans. Treat others how you want to be treated or just be quiet.
- I read a lot of things on Twitter, and I see a lot of things about Shayna and about me. I absolutely hate it when they rag on her and say she's boring. She's a heel, she's not supposed to be exciting. She's not supposed to make you like her.
- My dream since being a little girl is to be the most tattooed human ever.
- I had a tryout in Australia when I was 17 years old. The WWE contacted my trainers and asked who would be a few names that they would put forward for a tryout. My name was thrown in there, which I had only been wrestling for a year, and so I sent them back all my information after they emailed me and I was super excited.
- It makes me so happy to make everyone proud.
- I feel like everyone that is in this profession deals with bullying in social media and it's sad. It's a lot of people thinking we don't see it, because we get a lot of things on social media, but at the end of the day, we see these things.
- If the championship has to be defended, the championship has to be defended.
- I wanna make my family proud, I wanna make Australia proud, all of that.
- Everyone is their own individual and if you're not happy with that then you really gotta think about yourself.

- I went to Japan for three months and I learned a lot about strong style over there.
- I am a nice human, but I've also got Italian in my family. My mom's side is Italian and my mom is a very scary human being. I get a lot of that intensity and snap straight into it from her. She's legit terrifying. Lovely girl. Lovely mother but when she gets angry, she's absolutely terrifying. She's a damn monster.
- I worked hard every single day to become the NXT Women's Champion, and first of all to be the first-ever person to be from NXT to defend a championship from here at WrestleMania is absolutely insane.
- I look up to so many powerful women who succeeded before me and I'm here doing my thing to inspire women who will come after me.
- I feel like I have so much more to do here. Whether that's singles matches or whatever, I love NXT and I love being a part of it.
- Things in life change very frequently... things get thrown at you all the time. You just have to be ready for anything in this business - that's wrestling. It's just life, really.
- To be knowing that I'm going to WrestleMania 36 to face Charlotte Flair and put my NXT championship on the line is just absolutely insane.
- I don't think I can ever outgrow NXT.
- If I want to be Vegeta, let me be Vegeta.
- Being the first-ever NXT U.K. women's champion was just an absolute honor and privilege in itself.
- How many people in the women's division can say they wrestled Robert Stone? Just me. To me that's cool. It doesn't always matter if you're in the title picture, you just gotta make the best of what you're given and it was fun for me.
- My whole life I've had people telling me that I look like a man, I'm not feminine, I'm too masculine, all that stuff.
- Me being me, I feed off the crowd a lot.
- I get stuff every single day whether that be comments on my Instagram photos, or tweets about a tweet that I put out. Just tweets that they make in general to just pick on me, make me feel bad about myself, belittle me or anything. It's not good.
- I am a nice person. I'll put that out there.
- I want to see how far I can get, how many history making things I can put my name under.
- I feel like I have really bad body dysmorphia.
