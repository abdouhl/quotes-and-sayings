- I listened to a lot of Jay Z and Nas, stuff like that, so I was always New York-influenced. I think I have that New York flow.
- There's no other rapper that will drop a better album than me. No one.
- A lot of people really didn't expect for me to have a record with Kendrick, but I proved them wrong. It's not easy to get Kendrick on a record, so it was a huge deal for me to have him featured on the song.
- I did two records with DJ Mustard. They were stupid, like, crazy hits, so we just kept on working, and we did a whole project together, so we got that coming.
- I usually just have a circle of people that I associate myself with. I'm not really cool with a lot of people. It might seem like I'm cool with them, but I'm really not.
- It's my music. It's my craft. If you don't like it, then turn it off. Don't listen to it. But a lot of people listen to it... The numbers, they add up.
- Young artists, I really love to see us winning.
- The best route is to stay humble and stay true to yourself.
- I make a lot of money off featuring, doing songs with up-and-coming artists. I can charge someone $10,000 to $15,000 to do one song.
- Jaden Smith is a good friend of mine. We've got that song that just dropped on the 'Rich Forever II' tape, and we got a couple other songs that we have in the cut.
- Manny Smith & Interscope CEO John Janick understand me and my vision for myself and also my label. Interscope gave me the opportunity to take over the game completely, and that's what I'm going to do.
- I like being signed because you have the support system. It's all about the growth and labels give you that support you need.
- Dabbing started with us - QC the label - Jose Guapo, Migos, Skippa Da Flippa, PeeWee Longway. When we performed, we just dabbed, and everyone started running with it. People would do the dance, but no one would say what it was.
- I just feel like everyone should be working together and congratulating, be big upping each other instead of getting in they feelings and being jealous at younger cats.
- I'm a big follow-through person. Everything I do, and everyone I meet, I follow through with it.
- After I posted the picture of Frank Ocean, I think his little brother called him and said the picture was all over the Internet, so Frank Ocean was like, 'I'm not on social media like that, but it's cool. I'm not mad about it.'
- If I'm not on tour or doing a show, I'm in the studio.
- You don't have to work with everybody and be on songs with everybody just to make it.
- By now, people should know who I am. I have established myself as Rich the Kid, so people respect me.
- Everybody seen me talking to Frank Ocean, so they know something is coming, so something is coming with Frank Ocean - just wait on it - and, you know, people were just like, 'Whoa, Rich the Kid found Frank Ocean!'
- I was talking to different labels: Columbia, RCA , Epic. I decided not to sign with Epic even after L.A. Reid offered me a crazy deal.
- If the kids like it, my fans like it - whoever this music pertains to, if they like it, it's for them. That's what this art is for.
