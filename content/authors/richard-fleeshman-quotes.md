- I play piano and guitar and I do write my own stuff so to a certain extent I know what I want to do in regards to music. But I'm still finding out what kind of music is my favourite kind to listen to, never mind do myself so I've got a lot of time to find out myself and develop myself as an artist.
- You know, I was a kid when I went into 'Coronation Street' and I had an amazing time. I got some fantastic opportunities from Corrie and from 'Soapstar' and I'd never say they did anything other than help me.
- Skype is a wonderful thing. The irony is that you never Skype when you're in the same country as someone.
- I've never been out with any of the cast of Coronation Street. We're all very close friends so it's very much a professional attitude.
- If I'd just been interested in record sales, I would have taken one of the deals I was offered after 'Soapstar Superstar,' made a quick covers album and probably had some success for five minutes. I decided that wasn't for me.
- I'm not really into gothic music, it's not really my type of scene but each to their own. I listen to pretty much anything.
- I've never really been star struck. I was a little bit taken aback when I was doing a chat show recently and I was sat in the make-up chair chatting to a guy say next to me but I couldn't look round and see who it was, it was only when I got up I realised it had been Bryan Adams I'd been talking to!
- I trust my mum with anything. If I have a problem, my mum is always the first person I go to.
- I'm quite looking forward to the fact that people know me as Richard rather than Craig.
- It still hasn't sunk in that I'm going to be in Coronation Street. Everything about the role is brilliant and I'm working with some great people.
- The Goth character was a difficult thing to get my head round. I'm not really a fan of Goth music. I'm more a piano and guitar man - that's what I love.
- It was great as an actor to be given the story line I was given but I didn't expect Craig to stay so it was a lovely twist when I found out they'd decided to keep him.
- I have really diverse tastes, which can be problematic sometimes, but it's good because it means I'm always listening to as much music as possible. I love listening to music, whatever genre it is.
