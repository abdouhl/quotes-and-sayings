- We are telling our kids that nature is in the past and it probably doesn't count anymore, the future is in electronics, the boogeyman is in the woods, and playing outdoors is probably illicit and possibly illegal.
- Leave part of the yard rough. Don't manicure everything. Small children in particular love to turn over rocks and find bugs, and give them some space to do that. Take your child fishing. Take your child on hikes.
- By bringing nature into our lives, we invite humility.
- We tend to block off many of our senses when we're staring at a screen. Nature time can literally bring us to our senses.
- I do not trust technology. I mean, I don't think we're in any danger of kids, you know, doing without video games in the future, but I am saying that their lives are largely out of balance.

- Our kids are actually doing what we told them to do when they sit in front of that TV all day or in front of that computer game all day. The society is telling kids unconsciously that nature's in the past. It really doesn't count anymore, that the future is in electronics, and besides, the bogeyman is in the woods.
- It's easy to blame the nature-deficit disorder on the kids' or the parents' back, but they also need the help of urban planners, schools, libraries and other community agents to find nature that's accessible.
- When you're sitting in front of a screen, you're not using all of your senses at the same time. Nowhere than in nature do kids use their senses in such a stimulated way.
- A lot of people think they need to give up nature to become adults but that's not true. However, you have to be careful how you describe and define 'nature.'
- Mothers tend to be more direct. Fathers talk to other fathers about their kids more metaphorically. It's a different way of communication.
- No other youth group like the Scouts has trained so many future leaders while at the same time being a nature organization with its outdoor focus.
- Natural playgrounds may decrease bullying.
- There's a generation now that didn't grow up in nature. Some of these adults are parents and they know that nature is good for their kids but they don't know where to start.
- Kids are absolutely starved for positive adult contact.
- Now, more than ever, we need nature as a balancing agent.
- Green exercise improves psychological health.
- Kids are plugged into some sort of electronic medium 44 hours per week.
