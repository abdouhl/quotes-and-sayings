- I want people who see my watches to go, 'Wow!' And the more they look at them, the more they go into it, the more I want them to say, 'Wow!' I work on a razor blade between gimmickry and amazement.
- I love paradox. I like to go where people don't expect me to go.
- The gesture of taking the watch from the pocket and looking at the time is very elegant for a man, but if I was going to create a pocket watch, I wanted it to be very modern. I didn't want to do old-fashioned.
- People think a watch must weigh a lot to be a luxury. But there's no reason why we should add weight to create value. People have to overcome these notions.
- My only market analysis was to look around and see that, in one way or another, most watches are inspired by watches that were made in the 18th and 19th centuries. If I wanted a watch like that, I'd much rather buy the real thing at auction than a replica.
- If you want a watch with diamonds on the bezel, you don't need me.
- I'm crazy about cars, about boats, about airplanes, about anything mechanical - I'm just a boy, really, and my clients are like boys, too.
- I think the time is ripe for a return to the refinement of lifestyle that the pocket watch embodies. A personal pleasure that you know you have in your pocket, which requires an elegant gesture to use and show to others.
