- We don't need bipartisanship, we need application of principle.
- To all of you who are Republicans of long standing, I hope you appreciate that I always tried to stand for conservative values.
- Bipartisanship has taken us to the brink of bankruptcy. We don't need bipartisanship, we need application of principle... Where was the call for bipartisanship during the Obamacare debate? Not a single Republican voted for it. It wasn't about bipartisanship, it was about having the votes to dictate your will.
- Let's do away with the Departments of Education, Energy Commerce, Housing and Urban Development.
- I used to dig around the sandbox and pull out pieces of coal and show them to my mother, and she used to say that's how I must have known I was going to be a geologist.
- I have a mindset that says bipartisanship ought to consist of Democrats coming to the Republican point of view.
- I will always call Darmstadt, Indiana, home.
- I have to certainly stand for life. I know that there are some who disagree, and I respect their point of view. But I believe that life begins at conception. The only exception I have to have on abortion is in that case - of the life of the mother. I struggled with it myself for a long time, but I came to realize life is that gift from God.
- I think the best thing we can do is sell that idea of smaller government - of fiscal responsibility vs. the Obama record. Obama made promises, and on every promise in which he's actually delivered, things have gotten worse instead of better. He said if we get ObamaCare it'll help, but health care prices went up.
- Indiana taxpayers, retired Hoosier state policemen and teachers are neither greedy speculators nor unpatriotic. They are, however, secured creditors of Chrysler. They deserve to have their funds protected under the full auspices of the law.
- All of Obama's policies are working against economic growth, not for it, and Republicans ought to be talking about it and they're not. We need to take a stand.
- What I've said about compromise, I hope to build a conservative majority so bipartisanship becomes Democrats joining Republicans to roll back the size of government, reduce the bureaucracy, and get America moving again.
- I always start my discussions with the Tea Party groups with telling them, 'you know I have only three words for you: God. Bless. You.' Because the Tea Party's bringing the Republican party back to a more conservative base.
- People in Indiana like to see their politicians at the county fair or the Rotary Club.
- I am a very even-keeled guy.
- I believe God controls the universe. I don't believe biology works in an uncontrolled fashion.
- I believe life is precious; I believe that to the marrow of my bones.
- I didn't grow up in politics.
- If not for the Tea Party, the Republican Party would not be coming back to its roots.
- I'm absolutely confident that the God that I worship abhors violence.
- The fact is, you never compromise on principles. If people on the far Left, they have a principle to stand by, they should never compromise; those of us on the Right should not either.
- I do think the Tea Party position will prevail, and I am often asked: 'What has the Tea Party done and is it even still alive?' People think because there have been no demonstrations with the 'Don't Tread on Me' flag it's gone, but it hasn't.
- Even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that is something that God intended to happen.
- It's a beautiful thing at 60 to know who you are.
