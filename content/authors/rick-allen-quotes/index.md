- But unfortunately, in my unrelenting drive to get back on that drum stool, the major casualty in all of it was that I really forgot about me.
- Just the same way I'd say a prayer before going onstage, taking that even further and using the drum to inspire people. And using that as a vehicle for the intention.
- But I think that the most important thing was to really stop drinking.
- I prefer the rather old and battered, things with character, to the brand new.
- Yes, of course that's true but you know, the irony of all that is that before the accident, I'd pretty much lost interest in playing drums.
- I really don't feel any strong allegiance to any country.
- But it's funny that now I'm in such a happy situation, I look more objectively at my own past and see what others have seen for a long time and I'm just so glad I've been able to get to this point.
- Some people say that practice makes perfect but I just feel that the repetition works against me and I start thinking too far ahead during a show.
- But the irony is that because the band isn't the focus any more, it allows me the chance to enjoy being a member of Def Leppard much more.
- Thinking about what songs are coming next instead of just relaxing, breathing and playing from my heart. Sometimes it can get to be almost like the enemy.
- I have never been one for the over-the-top.
- I think my perception of my own life is different and the fact that Lauren and myself are together. I've never felt this free or happy and so that permeates onto my onstage persona and to my working environment.
- Chasing the sensation. Whether it was drugs or sex or whatever. Those things had become my main focus in life.
- I was happy in Dublin because it is very cosmopolitan.
- 'Cause I felt I didn't have anything else to prove as a musician... and boy was I wrong about that one.
- If we had loads of money as a family, things would be different and they'd come to visit more and I'd get to spend more time here. But I'm laying down roots in America so when I'm there, just being at home, it's harder to break away from that.
- I think at that time I obviously wasn't aware of what I really needed. But conversely, my wanting to prove something to everyone was beneficial 'cause if I hadn't done it then, maybe I'd never have done it.
- My situation should have been a lot worse. By rights I shouldn't have survived the crash.
- I think all of those things, but certainly the booze really brought out the really unreasonable side of me, and I just didn't want to revisit that place again.
- I wanted to be as far away from everybody as I could be. I found it difficult to be close to anybody, not just the guys in the band.
- And more importantly, I wouldn't be the person I am today, I wouldn't be where I am now and I may not even have been here if it wasn't for the accident.
- Before my accident I was a little too... selfish and self-absorbed and for me, to now be at the place where I can kinda give back and inspire people. I'm blessed. I'm really blessed.
- At the end of the day, they're happy if you do the obvious songs towards the end of the set and you've got to try and make yourself happy by doing certain songs at the front end of the set.
- America feels like home as much as it does here. Although it's a strange situation as I feel almost like I'm in no-man's land some of the time, because although I'm a resident, I still can't vote so I don't really have a say in what goes on where I live.
- We're probably doing better business than we thought we would do especially considering the disappointing way the record company has handled the album.
