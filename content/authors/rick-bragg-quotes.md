- People who think there is something pedestrian about journalism are just ignorant.
- I don't think there's a difference between writing for a newspaper or magazine and doing a chapter in a book.
- There are these boutique writers out there who think if they are not writing their novels sitting at a bistro with their laptops, then they're not real writers. That's ridiculous.
- It is not unusual to send someone to conduct an interview you don't have time to conduct. It's what we do.
- I have dictated stories from an airport after writing the story out in longhand on the plane that I got from phone interviews and then was applauded by editors for 'working magic.'
