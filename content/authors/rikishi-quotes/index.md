- I'm very proud to be part of the biggest family in wrestling, the Samoan Dynasty.
- I enjoyed dancing with the Hardy Boyz back in the day. We did a lot of stuff at the house shows, dancing with Eddy Guerrero, and I think I had Mark Henry dancing as well. Kurt Angle danced. There were a lot of people who enjoyed that part of the magic of Rikishi and Too Cool.
- I love competition.
- The Stinkface made a lot of people famous. If you made the Stinkface list, you were pretty much famous. I knew once Vince McMahon took the Stinkface, everybody else was gonna line up for the Stinkface, and that's exactly what happened.
- One of my favorites was Bernie Mac.
- I'm an old school cat. I'm a fan of Richard Pryor and also Redd Foxx.
- Without the fans, there is no Roman Reigns.
- Jonathan and Joshua Fatu, they are pretty much well secured there in WWE. I taught my kids everything they need to know in the industry, but I think they have nothing else to prove in WWE.
- We love professional wrestling. It started with High Chief Peter Maivia and then Afa and Sika. The teachings that they have. The respect for the business. You protect the business. You go out there and be the best that you can.
- Even if you're not in the main event, you try to steal the show, because you can't stop talent, and for my family, they're continuing to do that, and I'm proud to say that.
- To me personally, I love the NXT brand.
- Let's take it back to John Cena and Rock back in the day, when people felt like they was just shoved down their throats. Eventually, they earned the people's respect, and the next thing you know, they were just loved by the whole world.
- To me, you don't want to go against the WWE Universe. You never want to do that. To me, what works is to go with the flow.
- Just to see the guys, how hard the passion, the drive, that they want to work hard to be able to get up to the main rosters, it's so exciting to me to watch that brand of NXT.
- Without the fans, there is no Samoan Dynasty, there is no Triple H, there is none of us. So the fans are entitled to their opinion.
- My thing is I'm always concerned about my kids and their bodies holding up in the industry. We don't have time off. They run 365 days a year and gone all the time and performing every night. I'm kind of leaning for them to go to Hollywood.
- In our family, we don't know why there are so many of us in wrestling. We think about it at the dinner table when we have big family reunions, and it just comes from a passion and love we have for the industry.
- I've done everything in professional wrestling.
- You're out there to perform. You're out there to entertain. Whatever position that you're put in, be it a heel or a babyface, go out there steal the show.
- The fundamentals of taking your bumps and falls and protecting each other - it's not about you when you are in a professional match; it's about the match. It's about taking care of each other.
- Whenever you go into a new industry, you definitely want to do your homework.
- Boston is one of my favorite places to wrestle.
- I'm a big fan of comedy such as Cendric the Entertainer.
- I read all my fan comments on my social media. I love answering questions.
