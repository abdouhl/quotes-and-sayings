- I was always stuck in a musical no man's land.

- Session work makes you more strict. You can't hit notes all over the place. You've got to make each one really count.
- Everything I do is usually totally spontaneous.

- Stevie Ray Vaughan was very intense. Maybe that's what caught everybody's attention. As a player, he didn't do anything amazing.

- I don't put myself on Jeff Beck's level, but I can relate to him when he says he'd rather be working on his car collection than playing the guitar.

- Those record companies don't know what's happening at all.
- I feel like I own the stage.
- I've always played every amp I've ever had full up, because rock and roll is supposed to be played loud. Also, that's how you get your sustain.

- I found the blues too limiting, and classical was too disciplined.
- Learning to play with a big amplifier is like trying to control an elephant.
- Jimi... He was the gov'nor and that's it. He was brilliant, wasn't he?
- But you have to give your whole life to a cello. When I realized that, I went back to the guitar and just turned the volume up a bit louder.
- I can turn on some jazz guitarist, and he won't do a thing for me, if he's not playing electrically. But Jeff Beck's great to listen to.
- I like leaping around on stage as long as it's done with class. None of this jumping up in the air and doing the splits.

- Ian Gillan, Roger Glover and I wanted to be a hard rock band - we wanted to play rock and roll only.
- In my early days, I never used finger vibrato at all. I originally carved my reputation as one of the 'fast' guitar players.
