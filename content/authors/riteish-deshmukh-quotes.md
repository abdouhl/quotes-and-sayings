- I personally feel that, for some people, their physique and looks work for them. And when you're deprived of both these aspects, you rely on humour!
- If you are sincere and true to your work, you will be respected. And for me, respect is power.
- It's such a lovely feeling to be in love, to marry the person you love and finally to be with that person. I feel the romance should never go out of any marriage. Even after one has had kids, etc. Love never ends, na?
- The beauty of a relationship is when you get used to a person; it is not sudden. It is just a process, and you don't realise when love happens.
- The first time I had sushi, I hated it. And the second time was no different, and then, I just started loving it. I actually crave for sushi. It's one of the healthiest meals. My experiments with food began when I was working in New York as an architect, be it Korean or Ethiopian food or fusion food.
- Life itself has so much politics, why should I make it my profession? I'm just a politician's son, not a politician myself. Two politicians, that's my dad and elder brother, in the family are enough. I'm happy doing my own stuff in Bollywood.
- I didn't know how it was to be a bachelor. I never felt like one. I think it's a mental state.
- When it comes to politics, there's never a certain yes or no to any situation.
- I think to take your shirt off, you need to have a great body and more than that, confidence and attitude. It's all related. A great body equals confidence, and confidence equals attitude. And when you put all three together, you get a Salman Khan! And that's not me.
- I am all for trying out various kinds of hair styles. I have even worn a wig earlier in a film where I essayed the part of a woman.
- I like to watch films with my wife and friends. That's how films should be watched. Only then can you enjoy the movies. Then whether it is raunchy or not, hardly matters.
- I think any kind of comic sequence is as easy and as difficult as it is written. So, if it is written well, then it becomes easy. Sometimes you find it difficult because the humour is not coming out.
- Comedy as a genre is the one that has given me maximum success, and I do broadly get associated with this genre. I thoroughly enjoy comedy, especially because it is inherent to my personality.
- Acting has been my first passion, and turning a producer was a natural progression.
- We make authentic Maharashtrian food at home. My mother supervises the preparation and the menu every day. She has been doing this since before I was born. I absolutely love the mutton sukka that she makes.
- I love to watch movies and play cricket.
- I just can't resist mutton biryani. It's something I've loved eating as a child too. Whenever I'm feeling low, I just pep myself with some good biryani.
