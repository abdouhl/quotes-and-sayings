- I don't want to die in a car accident. When I die it'll be a glorious day. It'll probably be a waterfall.
- I try to lie as much as I can when I'm interviewed. It's reverse psychology. I figure if you lie, they'll print the truth.

- We were constantly moving to different countries and adjusting to new things. It was such a free feeling. I'm glad I didn't have a traditional upbringing.
- I've been wanting to go into music ever since I can remember. I mean even before I became an actor. I just thought it would be a tough field to break into, so I became an actor instead.
- It's a great feeling to think that I can be a friend to so many people through my movies.
- I have a lot of chameleon qualities, I get very absorbed in my surroundings.
- I did my best work in The Mosquito Coast. I know it wasn't such a big hit, but for me it was more meaningful than anything else I'd ever done.
- We are taught to consume. And that's what we do. But if we realized that there really is no reason to consume, that it's just a mind set, that it's just an addiction, then we wouldn't be out there stepping on people's hands climbing the corporate ladder of success.
- Everything is ironic to me. There are moments I find hysterical, but I'm probably the only one who would find that, except for a few people.
- Music is a whole oasis in my head. The creation process is so personal and fulfilling.

- Vegetarianism is a link to perfection and peace.
- When I was in first grade, everyone made fun of my name, of course. I think it's kind of a big name to hold up when you're nine years old. It seemed goofy. I used to tell people I wanted to change the world and they used to think, 'This kid's really weird'.
- Music is my main goal, but I'm not going to rush a record out. There are so many actors who have come out with albums these days. I don't want to do it because it's the thing to do. I want to wait until the time is right.
