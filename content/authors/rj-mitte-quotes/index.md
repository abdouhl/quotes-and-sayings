- It's difficult to learn to play these different disabled characters - Campbell in 'Switched At Birth' was paralysed from the waist down - but it's nice to be able to step into their world and live in these characters' shoes and to be able to play them, because it gives you a different look at life.

- With moderate physical training, you can control anything in your body. You don't have to be an athlete to do it, and this isn't just about people with disabilities - it's about everyone. You just have to have the willpower, the mindset, and the desire to want to better yourself.
- People used to call the Paralympics the 'Special Olympics.' These men and women are athletes. They are warriors. They are people who are not confined by what they have been given. It's amazing to see where, and how far, the human body can really go.

- I was eight when I found out I was adopted. My step-brother told me. He'd overheard my mum and my stepdad at the time talking about it, and he threw it in my face. But I didn't really care. It didn't seem relevant, because I never once in my life felt unloved or like I was a burden.
