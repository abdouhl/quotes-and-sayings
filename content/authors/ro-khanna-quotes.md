- We have an economy that's really geared toward rewarding the investor class. What are we doing to make sure that people who want to have a middle-class life are able to keep up?
- Silicon Valley is actually a prime target for an ICBM missile strike.

That's where you would be attacking the future economy.

- If anything, prolonged overseas military presence breeds radicalization.

- Internet service providers should not be permitted to block, throttle and unfairly favor certain content, applications, services or devices.
- The fruits of the economy and all the advantages of technology and globalization have gone far more to the investor class and the professional class and not as much to the working class.
