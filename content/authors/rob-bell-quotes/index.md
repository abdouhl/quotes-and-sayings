- When we get to what happens when we die, we don't have any video footage. So let's at least be honest that we are speculating, because we are.
- My experience as a pastor is lots of people have really toxic, dangerous, psychologically devastating images of God in their head, images of a God who's not good.

- The historical orthodox Christian faith is extremely wide and diverse.
- The fundamental story arc of the Bible is God is passionate about rescuing this world, restoring it, renewing it.
- As a pastor, you get invited into the most poignant moments of people's lives. Whether it's a wedding or a funeral or a hospital visit, you get invited into the center of the event, whether or not you know the people.

- I am for love, whether it's a man and a woman, a woman and a woman, a man and a man.
- My parents were both very intellectually honest, straightforward, and for them, faith meant that you were fully engaged.
- We live in a world where we have friends, neighbors, brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, people we journey with for years who are gay. And we need to love, affirm and all of us together work on the real problems that we have in the world.
- The myth of redemptive violence - Caesar, peace, and victory - is in people's bones so deeply, we aren't even aware of it. You crush the opposition; that's how we bring peace.

- I believe God gives people the right to say no, to resist, to refuse, to reject, to cling to their sins, to cling to their version of their story.
- A lot of Christians have been taught a story that begins in chapter 3 of Genesis, instead of chapter 1.

So Jesus is seen as primarily dealing with our sins.
- Suffering, it turns out, demands profound imagination. A new future has to be conjured up because the old future isn't there anymore.
- I embrace the term 'evangelical,' if by that we mean a belief that we together can actually work for change in the world, caring for the environment, extending to the poor generosity and kindness, a hopeful outlook. That's a beautiful sort of thing.
- Celebrity seems totally at odds with authentic community and honest, real sorts of relationships.
