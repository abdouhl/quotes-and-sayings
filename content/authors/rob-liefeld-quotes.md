- All comic-book artists secretly want a successful television or movie project because of the wider audience.
- I love 'Captain America.' I love those fight sequences, but I've seen them multiple times.
- Gene Hackman's portrayal of Lex Luthor did not exist in comic books. This is not my Lex Luthor, but I really like it.
- I wanted to launch 'Youngblood' with an exclusive relationship with ComiXology because I believe that they can provide the extra push that a launch like this requires.
- I love my craft.
- My kids love going to the comics store with me, but they have insatiable appetites for new apps, and I truly believe we have to be online in order to reach their generation.
- Women love the bad boy.
- As I get older and more mature, my artwork changes accordingly.
- When I took over 'New Mutants,' writing and drawing, and I figure this is a big deal, I'm 23, 22 at that time, and I am nervous because I've had nothing but success. And now they're giving me the entire platform to create. And I figure, if I fall flat on my face here, it's going to hurt. It's going to set me back.
- I had seen this comic called 'Invincible' created by two people I had never heard of before, Robert Kirkman and Cory Walker, and I was a huge fan. 'Invincible' probably had five or six issues under the belt, and the book was so impressive to me, I was surprised that I had never heard of them before. It's like they came out wholly formed.
- 'New Mutants' #100 went out the door with over a million copies. It is the highest-selling last issue of any comic ever. And that's when I knew that I spoke fandom. I spoke their language.
- Dave Cockrum's work at Marvel and DC defined my childhood and inspired me to be a comic book creator. Without Dave, there is no New 'X-Men' resurgence, there is no Colossus, Storm, Nightcrawler, Lilandra, Star Jammers, or the Imperial Guard. His influence on generations of fans cannot be measured.
- Unapologetically, absent me, there is no Deadpool. Period. I am the name, the costume, the look, the origin, and the attitude. Great one-liners are the result of other writers. But there's no Deadpool at all in existence without me.
- I'm very invested in 'Youngblood' at all stages.
- 'Deadpool' took seven years to get to the motion picture screen, and I use that as my measurement. That tested me and my patience more than anything I could've imagined because the screenplay was so good.
- Marvel comics took a chance on me in my youth, allowing me to create so many toys in their sandbox.
- Anything that is good influences the next thing. It's inevitable. I believe that Hollywood influences the comics, and the comics influence Hollywood - it's a cycle.
- I've seen every Ryan Reynolds movie. I'm a fan.
- 'Deadpool' was 'Alien.' It's brilliant. It completely works. It's a masterpiece. 'Deadpool 2' is 'Aliens.'
- I always had a great history of comics. I've been buying them since I was six years old. I was a student of the craft.
- I've always had a fortunate knack for grabbing young talent and giving them a break.
- A fixer-upper is good for your business if you are the guy who fixes it up.
- Everyone at ComiXology has been very supportive and enthusiastic about getting 'Youngblood' as well as the rest of the Awesome/Extreme catalogue online. Hopes are high that this relationship leads to more online comics.
- We can't be beholden to the past.
- Give me a celebrity, I'll give you your haters. Some people shine, and some people don't like when they shine. Ask Barack Obama - he'll tell you.
- Mercenaries, to me, were always able to switch sides because they're motivated by cash. Deadpool has always been a shifty bastard.
- We've gotten into this 'family friend' space, and 'Deadpool' trashes it.
- I've had really hard struggles in my life.
- I love Deathstroke! I was 12 in 1980 when Deathstroke appeared in 'Teen Titans' #2.
- 'X-Force' #1 sold 5 million copies. By default, the second issue dipped and did 1.3 million copies. But the cover of 'X-Force' #2 is Deadpool. It's not X-Force, It's Deadpool.
- I truly believe there's all the Deadpools that have existed, and there's Ryan Reynolds' Deadpool, who is now the Deadpool for the world. He owns that voice.
- I'm not that guy that blows deadlines anymore.
- At nine years old, I saw 'Star Wars.' I saw it a gazillion times.
- I'm just a guy drawing comics. Guys knocking other guys through buildings. Guys flipping tanks over on each other. I'm just trying to be true to what I liked as a kid.
- We've had a steady diet of that PG-13 entertainment. It's the best vanilla you can buy. It's delicious, but it's getting kind of samey.
- I am a huge fan of all things Mondo, and when the opportunity to illustrate a Mondo print celebrating the 'Deadpool' film presented itself, I leapt at the chance!
- I was given a chance to re-haul 'New Mutants' and take it from the dog of the 'X-Men' office to 1 million copies with its final issue.
- Just because one tribe piles on you, take shelter and continue to work towards your next goal, your next project. Don't be discouraged and remember that there are many fans of your work rooting for you to succeed.
- I am a lifelong Moebius geek. The European approach is perfect, the art is beautiful, and the storytelling is fantastic.
- The Tony Stark I grew up with wasn't as snappy and as quippy as Downey Jr. made him, but now I only think of his performance.
- Ryan is Deadpool. Look, Ryan Reynolds, he's gone through that same career arc; the guy is ridiculously talented. He has a huge, huge passion for 'Deadpool.'
- Everyone has embraced the family-friendly Disney approach, which is great. I see all of those movies, and I take my kids. But I grew up on 'Predator,' 'Alien,' and 'Terminator.' People forget, but those were R-rated movies. So 'Deadpool' put its money where its mouth is, and it changed the game.
- Deadpool was introduced as a mercenary and a bounty hunter... because I was so crazy for Boba Fett when I was a kid.
- I know, for some people, 2016 was entirely miserable. And I'm like, 'Does it have to end?' Because over here in the Liefeld corner, it's been phenomenal.
- I've loved Hawkman since I was really young.
- Deadpool does not exist in any way, shape, or form without me.
- I root for 'Spawn' and every other comic-book movie. I hope all of them are successful because, any time one fails, it makes it that much harder to get one made.
- The visual of Deadpool was very informed by Spider-Man.
- 'Brigade' is about one man leading his team to save the fabric of reality even as it comes undone.
- You can't rewrite the history books; you can't eliminate the impact of my work and my characters.
- As a kid, my favorite book, up until 'X-Men,' was 'Avengers.' What does Captain America have? He has a shield. What does Thor have? He has a hammer. What does Hawkeye have? He has a bow and arrow. That's why Cable came with weapons. That's why Deadpool had swords and machine guns and pistols. It's like, let's weaponize these dudes.
- I've been as much a DC guy as anything else my entire fan life.
- I love getting older.
- I grew up on R-rated action films, and you didn't blink.
- Certain things work on paper held together with staples. Comics use bright colors to make things leap off the page, but movies are a different medium.
- Captain America and the Avengers were my favorite characters as a kid.
- When you hold something you created, drew, and conceived, and now here it is in 3D plastic - it is a rush.
- If you only see 'No Country for Old Men' and 'Sicario,' you've seen two great, totally separate Josh Brolin performances.
- My characters came with a lot of gear, a lot of weaponry.
- Late '90s, early 2000s, Rob was in a definite fog.
- As to Batman, turns out I really prefer Robin over the Dark Knight.
- Even if it flops, when you're sitting at the drawing table, you dream about seeing your work on the big screen, no matter what.
- I wasted so many years in my youth.
- Carter Hall is a cross between Indiana Jones and Robert Langdon from 'Da Vinci Code' and 'Angels and Demons.'
- If you were to Google 'SWAT' right now, or Google 'Military,' you would see guys covered in pouches. That's a sign of gear! We've got stuff in here. We carry stuff. And it's an aesthetic.
- I started thinking, 'What if Superman or Batman really existed?' Superman would be doing Nike commercials. The members of Youngblood take the genre of super-heroes and turn it into a business.
- Deadpool was intended, as Cable was, to be tied into Wolverine's history.
- So much of our society has gone completely digital. Today, you can attend school, buy TVs, plan a vacation, and pay your bills electronically. Why not bring comic books into the digital realm?
- I'm not a fan of the Michael Keaton 'Batman,' which came out in 1989.
- Our style, in one word, the Image guys, our approach to the page was bold.
- My entire tenth grade year, my dad was in a coma. That changes a person. It changes a kid. It makes you ridiculously independent.
- Watching people like Brandon Graham, Erik Larsen, and Joe Keatinge produce stories for my characters was a revelation... Like, 'Why are you doing work for hire when others are working on characters you own?' 'Bloodstrike' and 'Brigade' is me re-focusing my focus!
- The funniest is the moms who get really angry with me, and they bring their kid who's dressed like Deadpool, and he's 9 years old, and they're scolding me that their little kid can't enjoy Deadpool.
- I've always loved both Marvel and DC equally, but I don't have a career without DC giving me the original 'Hawk and Dove' mini-series.
- I'll be on the street and go up to people - 'Have you read a comic book before? Well, here's one.' You've got your pro-life people, your pro-choice people, your feminists. I'm a comicbooks activist.
- I love drawing Ryan Reynolds in his Deadpool costume. He looks amazing and is the true embodiment of the Merc with a Mouth!
- I can tell you, young 22-year-old Rob Liefeld was having quite a run.
- I'm capable of a ton of work. My Kirby gene has been fully activated. And by that, I mean the capability to draw many pages.
- Here's the deal: 25 years' worth of Deadpool. This movie comes out 25 years to the day we published him at Marvel, and you couldn't get a better gift if you're a 'Deadpool' fan.
- 'Youngblood' #1 was my first brush with Internet bashing. Message boards were just emerging, but the criticism was drowned out by millions of copies flying off shelves.
- 'Deadpool Bad Blood' is a book that long-term fans of Wade Wilson can appreciate it along with newcomers and movie fans. We gave this book everything we had, and I think it shows.
- The mutants I like - Wolverine. The action heroes I like, they have weapons; they are more visceral. So I filled the comic with characters like that, and we got big results.
- 'New Mutants' is the absolute definition of a broken down jalopy, and I took it on, and I just remade it... That's why I was so cocky and confident: because I was like, 'I just turned around this broken down comic book with products of my imagination.'
- Trust me: I was the most bullish on 'Deadpool.' When I was day one on the set, I said, 'This is going to open at $75 million,' and they all said, 'Shut up, Liefeld; you're jinxing us.'
- If you spend 90 seconds with Ryan Reynolds, you know he's Deadpool. There is no one else on the planet that has any business being that character, ever.
- My role as an artist helps me tremendously in breaking down each story. Pacing, layout, movement - having drawn a few thousand pages, I understand the language of comic books very well.
- Long before it was 'Raided' and 'Lost' with Indiana Jones, the Ark of the Covenant was originally stolen from the Israelites by The Philistines; The Ark of the Covenant was the nuclear bomb of its age: when activated, it was devastating.
- Deadpool exploded for the youth around 2010 with 'Marvel vs. Capcom.' He was the most popular character. He does kicks, then mocks you as he hits you and dances around you when you hit the ground.
- Now, in the Liefeld household, I don't tend to share the fact that I created Deadpool with my kids, so when all the video games started coming out where Wade was at the center of them, I couldn't help but smile.
- In the late '90s, the magazine formerly known as 'The Wizard' came after me strong and hard. I was the brunt of jokes for an entire staff of angry fanboys; as much as can be poured on was poured on. But I kept focus, as anyone in that situation should.
- I ended up making my name at Marvel, but I've always desired greater access to the DCU characters. Bottom line: I'm a huge fan.
- I had gotten a lot of acclaim for giving a previously dead franchise, 'Hawk & Dove,' a facelift.
- The Internet snark has zero effect on me.
- People have debated both sides of the Liefeld influence, good and bad, and I maintain the sales and the results of that time bear out that people love that stuff.
- Domino is all about... as an actress and as the character that is going to be on the screen, you already allude to it: it's all about the sass.
- The '90s was a great period for the fans that were collecting at that time. Comics sold at an all-time high and reached the largest audience in our modern age, and the energy in our business was fantastic. Any bad feelings from fans of that era were a result of the poor delivery of the product we sold them.
- I never thought we'd live in an age where we'd get to 2008's 'Iron Man,' which I think is a perfect movie.
- I've got three kids, and my three kids make me feel like I'm getting older every day.
