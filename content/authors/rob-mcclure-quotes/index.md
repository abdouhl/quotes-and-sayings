- The very first audition, you just go in and sing. The second one, they give you this sort of cheapy, Walmart-looking puppet - before they give you the $6,500 'Avenue Q' puppet.
- One of the reasons I got into musical theater was Anthony Warlow. I was obsessed with the 'Jekyll and Hyde' concept album because of him.
- We are brunch hounds. We also like movie dates. There's a lot of diners, a lot of movies. We're 'simple pleasures' people. It doesn't have to be crazy. It could be a 'Law and Order' marathon on the couch, or it could be dinner or a show. We like to mix it up.
- I think it's ridiculous when people say, 'I don't date actors.' It's about the right person, and no matter what that right person does for a profession, they're still going to be the right person.
- My wife makes fun of me by calling me a grandpa because I have very little patience for inconsiderate children. So if we're walking in the mall, and some kid goes by really fast on a skateboard, I become the grumpiest eighty-five-year-old man in the world and start screaming at them.
- If you think hard enough about it, Rowlf the dog playing the piano on 'The Muppet Show' - what kind of insanity was happening underneath the cameras to make that happen? His mouth is moving, and he's got two hands playing the piano. That's two people under there!
- I think I've got to go back to 'Someone to Watch Over Me.' I think it's a perfectly written song. I really do. I think it's one of the great songs in the American Songbook, and it speaks to love in its simplest and purest form.
- Portraying Mozart is a scary task. Whenever I'm asked to portray actual historic figures, it comes with extra accountability. Not just to your director and playwright, but to the man himself and the beloved persona that the public forms.
- I was a huge Muppet fan growing up, but that was the extent of my puppet knowledge. I really loved the art form and the whole Henson universe.
- I didn't start to work until I realized what it was I had to offer. I stopped imitating performers I admired and started just being myself.
- No one knows this, but my dad can sing his face off.
- I've always been physical. I loved sports growing up. I was never specifically a dancer or anything like that.
- There are level-headed actors and outlandish actors and financially responsible actors and financially irresponsible actors.
- I certainly enjoy doing pantomime-y things, but I didn't have any specific training in it.
- I was a huge fan of 'Avenue Q' long before I ever dreamed of being a part of it. I saw it off-Broadway at the Vineyard and waited at the stage door for autographs!
- I think theater communities in cities can form really strong foundations.
- I was a bit of a goofball. I was always silly. I think that lends itself to being an actor.
- The nice thing about 'Honeymoon in Vegas' is we're not talking about some crazy smash hit where everyone is coming and comparing my performance to Nicholas Cage.
- I double majored in English education and theater with a musical theater minor. Teaching is the only thing that makes me as happy as performing.
- My initial introduction to him was - this is a funny story... My Aunt Marian, my entire life growing up, told me that I looked like Charlie Chaplin. That didn't really resonate with me when I was younger - I hadn't seen a lot of his films.
- Puppet camp truly redefined my preconceptions of puppetry... I'll never forget learning that before a puppet can speak... he has to inhale. It's those details that make the characters truly come to life.
- I would advise young aspiring theater artists to do as many shows as possible. It doesn't matter if it's in the basement of a church, in school, or in community theater. Do them wherever you can; big parts or small, it doesn't matter.
- I love to strive to be good at stuff that's really hard.
- I saw 'Cats' on a school trip. I thought it was neat and a little weird. The set was cool.
- Broadway is obviously a dream come true, but audiences everywhere continue to make performing a blast.
- I live in Philadelphia, and my wife and I do a lot of theater out in the Philadelphia community.
- I get teased a lot for my optimism.
- When I was a kid, I was hugely impacted by 'Jurassic Park.' I think I was just the right age when that movie came out, and I remember running around my town like a Velociraptor.
- Maggie and I got married and then had to wait three years before we got to take our honeymoon because we were both working! Right before 'Chaplin' began, we got to go to Hawaii.
- I never dreamed that the little ditties I wrote about annoying customers or bagel recipes would turn into a full-length musical comedy. But a very wise person told me to 'write what you know'. So I did.
- I'm not Charlie Chaplin and will never, ever claim to be. But when I become the 'Tramp,' I can feel the hair stand up on the back of my neck.
- I had seen 'Avenue Q' off-Broadway back in 2003 and fell in love with it. I just thought it was the smartest, funniest thing I'd seen in a long time.
- I would say that Pixar is doing for animation what Chaplin did for film, infusing it with heart and characters that you care about and stories that you lose yourself in. They are similar revolutionaries and changing a medium.
