- We don't believe we've solved the multicore-programming problem. But we think we've built an environment in which a certain class of problems can take advantage of the multicore architecture.
- You have to make a decision whether it's a new product or you integrate it with an existing product. It takes time to work these things out.
- Go is an attempt to combine the safety and performance of statically typed languages with the convenience and fun of dynamically typed interpretative languages.
- Dynamic typing is not necessarily good. You get static errors at run time, which you really should be able to catch at compile time.
- When Steve Jobs died last week, there was a huge outcry, and that was very moving and justified.
- We're systems software people ourselves. We wanted a language to make our lives better.
- The process of software development doesn't feel any better than it did a generation ago.
- Pretty much everything on the web uses those two things: C and UNIX. The browsers are written in C. The UNIX kernel - that pretty much the entire Internet runs on - is written in C.
- To write a kernel without a data structure and have it be as consistent and graceful as UNIX would have been a much, much harder challenge.
- Web servers are written in C, and if they're not, they're written in Java or C++, which are C derivatives, or Python or Ruby, which are implemented in C.
