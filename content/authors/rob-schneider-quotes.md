- I try not to have too much of an ego. I'll do anything.
- Women always feel like they're being stared at and judged, and rightfully so.
- I lost that excitement I had when I first started out. It was all about the need to just get a job, and so I found the joy again when I was writing Deuce Bigelow. I was laughing so hard and along with my writing partner at the time, simply laughing until we cried.
- I try not to worry about what that's going to look like. If you worry about looking stupid, that's when you look really stupid.
- Studio people are idiots. Until they see someone else doing it and make a success of it, they don't open their minds. Most of them are idiots.
- A woman can laugh and cry in three seconds and it's not weird. But if a man does it, it's very disturbing. The way I'd describe it is like this: I have been allowed inside the house of womanhood, but I feel that they wouldn't let me in any of the interesting rooms.
- First of all, weren't all the best beatings in the trailer for 'The Passion of the Christ'? I hate when the trailer gives away all the best stuff.
- I like to sneak in under the radar. I don't have any paparazzi following me or have to deal with that stuff. I'm never in the tabloids. I prefer that.
