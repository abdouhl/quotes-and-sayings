- My life is going to continue to be public, and I just accept that.
- Sometimes with success comes some crazy that goes along with it.
- I do a happy dance even when I get a guest-star role.
- What I say about actors is you always want to find an actor you can play ball with. You throw the ball at them and you want them to throw it back. Your ball playing is a lot better when you play with good ballplayers, like any sport. Every actor I know feels the same way.
- 'Prison Break' really changed me to somebody that can put butts in seats.
- I did a film when I was about 30; it's a coming of age story called 'Gas Food Lodging,' and I'm so proud of that little independent film. I play this young English geologist, and he's such a simple, loving kind of guy. Doesn't talk too much. He's just a quiet guy, and he gets the girl.
- With comedy, if you write something for me, I'm better at it. I'm not sure I'm so good at improvisational stuff.
- I continue to be known as a guy that plays really complex, three-dimensional characters.
- When you're a little kid, growing up, most of us know what's right and wrong. Our parents teach us that discipline.
- I think every actor should be always grateful when they work.
- I've had so much fun working on 'Shameless.'
- I have to admit, I never watch television; once in a while I'll see things, but I grew up without it. I had a father who said, 'I hate television;' it came into being when he was a kid, and he didn't have it, so he didn't think I needed it.
- I come to work with a smile and I leave with a laugh, and I'm so grateful.
- Clint Eastwood, to me, is Clint Eastwood. He's great at being Clint Eastwood. But, I don't know how to be that guy. I just don't know how to be one person.
- When people come up to me and say 'I hate you' or 'I love to hate you,' it's not the usual response that I thought I would've gotten halfway into my career. And then they say, 'I love your work.'
- I was the little kid growing up. I wasn't picked on because, honestly, I was fast, so I could run away from the bullies.
- On 'Prison Break,' I tended to talk a lot! They gave me a lot of fun words to say. There were always these great mouthfuls of words that would fall out!
- I thought I'd never do film, let alone television. I was a diehard theater nut.
- How do you make people do the best work? You make them feel comfortable, so you can feel comfortable - and then you can have a really good ballgame!
- I love being funny! I started in the theater when I was 9 and, believe it or not, always played the funny part!
