- As always, testing can only give you ideas on where you are. And it can also mislead you.
- I have my limitations which I never hide.
- Silverstone is normally quite a tricky place for the set-up and for finding a good balance, because you have a big difference between the low-speed and high speed corners, and there are not really any medium-speed corners in between.
- From a mental point of view, as I've had to rebuild my life from zero, it has been crucial I've never given up, that I've set achievable targets, not things that couldn't possibly be achieved.
