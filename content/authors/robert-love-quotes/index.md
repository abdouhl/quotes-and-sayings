- GPS's battery draining behavior is most noticeable during the initial acquisition of the satellite's navigation message: the satellite's state, ephemeris, and almanac.
- Android's user-space is so different from stock Linux, you can easily say that Android is not in any way a Linux system, except for the kernel.
- Mobile devices such as Android and the iPhone achieve their battery life largely because they can aggressively and quickly enter into and exit from sleep states. GPS prevents this.
- Realize you won't master data structures until you are working on a real-world problem and discover that a hash is the solution to your performance woes.
- The key to a solid foundation in data structures and algorithms is not an exhaustive survey of every conceivable data structure and its subforms, with memorization of each's Big-O value and amortized cost.
- GPS is expensive because it is a very slow communication channel - you need to communicate with three or four satellites for an extended duration at 50 bits per second.
- Good candidates can arrive at the binary search tree as the right path in a few minutes, and then take 10-15 minutes working through the rest of the problem and the other roadblocks I toss out. But occasionally I get a candidate who 'intuitively understands' trees and can visualize the problem I'm presenting.
- The interesting thing about Android's design is how little we modified the kernel.
- Compounding the cost, most mapping software is processor-intense.
- Learn when and how to use different data structures and their algorithms in your own code. This is harder as a student, as the problem assignments you'll work through just won't impart this knowledge. That's fine.
- Zero-length arrays are useful only in cases where you have a large structure, which contains a field of dynamic length, and you need to share that structure across program or even computer boundaries.
