- I'm allergic to the word 'important' in film and theatre. Cancer research is important.
- There are a few roles I want to play, but mostly I just want to keep doing a play every now and then, watch kids grow and eat cookies and drink tea.
- I didn't want to chase movies. It's too hard. You've got to work at it - opening nights, photo shoots, publicity people, managers. I never wanted to do that. I'm too lazy.
- My greatest desire was to be in a sandbox with Kevin Kline or Kenneth Branagh - to be with the people I admired - and I have.
- My brother is a policeman; my sister's an English teacher. When I hear what they make versus what I make, it's ridiculous.
- I probably haven't even seen ten of the films I've done. I don't get a joy out of it, and I don't go to the movies.
- When I was a kid, it was a little bit exciting working with Peter Weir and Robin Williams, but that faded pretty quickly for me.
- Any time the character is in a moral quandary is interesting. That's been true from the Greeks on down.
- Sure, theater is tough because you're not home at night a lot and you work on weekends - every job has its downside. But to do something that you love doing for two hours a night, that's a pretty sweet gig.
- I want to read books and go for walks and make dinner. I guess there are people who love working and that's great. I'm not one of them. I love tackling roles and I love theater, but filming, I don't get it. It seems mind-numbing to me.
- As a kid, the theatre always felt a bit like running away to join the circus.
- I think people respect my work, but I was never in one of those movies that made me a star.
- I was proud of 'House, MD,' and I think it was good for what it was and remarkably smart for a television show. I loved Hugh Laurie and was proud to be by his side that long and to be trusted by him.
- This is kind of a uniquely New York experience, but when you can't afford an apartment nicer than the place you're renting, there's something so inherently depressing about it.
- I want to know everything there is to know about Lewis and Clark. And I want to do the Sunday crossword in less than an hour. I want to be the best dad in the world. I want to play Richard II, and I want to win another Tony award.
- I prefer stage work, as an actor.
- My career has mostly been jobs I love or cases where I needed money.
- Los Angeles is a bleached-out, soulless pit.
- My wife and I are really strange people. We never spend any money.
- I didn't want to be the lead guy. That's too much work. But I thought that it might be fun to be the lead guy's friend. I'd have days off, and still get a paycheck every week.
- The less I work, the happier I am. I discovered that, as most people discover at some point.
