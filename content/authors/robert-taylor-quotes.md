- I've played the leads in two British TV series. I've done a bunch of mini-series. Everybody in Australia is a bit in awe of BBC. I've worked for there, and that was a great experience.
- I find it hard to do small roles sometimes.
- I've been working pretty solidly for a long time: Not that anyone would notice, you know what I mean? It's been my goal to work as much as possible, and be as unknown as possible.
