- Ronaldo was a phenomenon, but Zizou had something apart. Playing alongside him was a crazy thing! Supporters arrived earlier at the Bernabeu just to see him warm-up!
- The fans do not want to see 0-0.
- There will never be another Ronaldo 'Fenomeno.'
- Neymar is a phenomenon. He adapted to European football very quickly.

- Cafu was a leader on and off the pitch and it was he who invented the concept of right-backs running from corner to corner.
- I spent my career at big clubs.
- Marcelo has a completely different style from mine.
- In the modern game, players need to train harder than they did in my day.

- My season with Delhi Dynamos was very special.

- It is tough to find a European club with the kind of infrastructure that Corinthians have.
- Zidane is not a coach, but he is a teacher.
- Real Madrid are always after the best talent.
- One of the best moments was playing for this small team in Brazil called Uniao Sao Joao - the first match was the best, the most interesting, I loved it.
- Hiddink really taught me a lot. We talked every day at Anzhi and I saw how he dealt with difficult situations, how he always seemed to know what the players needed. He was a great teacher. I hope I can be as successful as him.
- It's great to see Zizou doing so well. He was a very quiet team-mate, he didn't speak much, but he was a phenomenon on the pitch and he was learning all the time. We didn't know he was going to be a coach but he always had the qualities for it.
- My objective is to coach the national team.
- The best tactics are those which lead you to a win.
- Everyone wants to have fun playing football. A person goes to the stadium to have fun.
- I don't buy books, ever... and I only tend to read the sports press.
- I don't like it when my friends get used.
- I've had a lot of great coaches. I think Guus Hiddink and Vicente del Bosque are the ones closest to my style. I'm more friendly with the players than a 'formal' coach. I'm not a professor. I'm Roberto Carlos and I want to win with my players and I want them to help me by doing their job well.
- I watch the Premier League every weekend. I think it's fantastic. One thing you notice is that the teams considered small are capable of surprising the likes of Chelsea, Manchester United and City.
- I don't have enemies.
- The best I've played against is Luis Figo. As for team-mates, it has to be Zinedine Zidane. He made things easier for everybody.
- Pep is a modern coach, he's intelligent, brave, likes football and always has the players on his side. He knows a lot about football, but Mourinho's success in all countries where he has been confirms him as the best.
- Real Madrid is bigger than egos. The club is huge and the culture of the club was so big that we were able to sign huge players. It was then up to the players to adapt to the culture and not the other way around.
- I came close to joining Villa early on in my career but nothing happened. I met with them and also with people from Birmingham but nothing materialised.
- Everything I experienced in the national team was amazing. I was there for 14 years and won several titles: the Copa America, Confederations Cup and the World Cup.

- The last 26 years of my career have all been great.
- Dybala is an excellent player.
- For me, Corinthians are one of the four biggest clubs in the world.

- Playing in international club competitions and winning international trophies for my club was a truly special experience for me.
- It is always a pride to return to the Bernabeu.
- I have known Eto'o since I was 16 and since then I always liked him. He is a good person, but he always thinks of himself and not the group.
- I've played for Real Madrid and Inter, clubs at the highest level, but Corinthians is a well-organised club and a reference for our country.
- Plan your free-kick and imagine where you need to hit the ball. Hang a T-shirt under the bar and try to hit it with the ball.
- Messi is phenomental but in my opinion, Cristiano is a special player because he does everything for Madrid.
- Mourinho is his own man, he has his own way of doing things and you have to respect that.
- Zizou has been a leader wherever he has played. He was the captain of France, a World Cup winner and been a winner in all the clubs he played for. So he has enough experience to handle and manage a group. More importantly, he is a man who everyone respects.
- Zidane is a leader in the dressing room. His personality is going to make him very successful.
- Messi is incredible and his history in football is marvellous.
- Whenever I'm asked about Cristiano Ronaldo or Lionel Messi, I always answer: 'Neymar is the best,' not just because of his goals but because of the ease with which he plays.
- There are so many great players in the Premier League and of course the big teams are always the favourites, but the teams below them also play good football. The mixture of foreign and English players works really well.

- I love English football because it's real football. I love everything that surrounds it. The public, the atmosphere, the preparation.
- If I go to a club and marry a project, I go to win.
- The coach of Madrid must be very fond of the players and should not put them under a lot of pressure.
- I met Ronaldo in 1993 and from that moment we always shared the room. I've slept more times with Ronaldo than my wife.
- The quality of Indian players is very high. They need to show motivation to perform at the highest level.
- My goal one day is to be Brazil coach, but to get there I need to have a club career. I started well in Turkey. I started well in Russia and I did a good job in India.
- From close range the free-kick is taken with inside of the foot. I will take a run-up of two or three steps and take the kick with the inside of the foot and the ball will travel in a straight line towards the goal. If it is a long-range free-kick, then I will use the outside of my foot. The ball will turn in the air and head towards the goal.
- The longer you stay in Madrid, the more you realise what this club means to people - not just in the city but also elsewhere in Spain and around the world. No matter where we played, we'd see our fans. No matter whether we played a Clasico or a small cup game, the Bernabeu would be full.
- I used to go a lot to F1 when Real Madrid didn't play at the weekends. It was a lot of fun and I always wanted Real Madrid to play on a Saturday so I could watch F1 on Sunday!
- I was lucky enough to win the Intercontinental Cup twice and I know first-hand how important international competitions like the FIFA Club World Cup are to both players and fans.
- When I was playing for Real Madrid, we competed in the UEFA Champions League most of the time and won it three times. When we didn't win we always ended up in the later rounds.
- There are seven days in a week. I take seven free kicks daily.
- There is a magical feeling when the Champions League music sounds at the beginning of each game, it is the biggest club competition and is the trophy that every player wants to have.

- Every team needs leaders, but not just one or two.
- Footballers are super-intelligent and there is only one football language: to win, to win, to win.
- Everything I have experienced and learned in football led me towards one day becoming a coach.
- For me, David Beckham will always be a legend... everything David represents for soccer, as an example to children, is reserved for very few people.
- I honestly can't tell you that this or that has been the best, my entire career has been great.
- My philosophy has always been to try to solve problems with a smile on my face.
- Until the moment I stop playing football, I want to win more titles.
- I want to make history as a coach, just like I did as a player.
- I'm a modern coach when it comes to training. I pick a lot of things up and I watch a lot of training sessions and follow a lot of leagues around the world.
- When you play for a club like Madrid, you always have to stay in the present, because everything is so intense: the sprints, the headers, the tackles, the training sessions, the away trips, the hotels. The victories and the defeats.
- Gabriel Jesus will be for Neymar what Benzema is for Cristiano Ronaldo at Real Madrid. He has the same focus as Karim.
- Talking about Cristiano is very easy. He is the best in the world.
- In Brazil, I walked around with a lot of security. Fans were threatening to fight me.
- There are times when you win and you don't see mistakes.
- It was a coach called Adailton Ladeira who first asked me to play as left-back in 1988. I was a left-winger, but our left-back was injured at Uniao Sao Joao, my first club, and he asked me to fill in. I said 'no problem,' and I've played there ever since.
- I can tell you that the Galacticos era in the early 2000s wasn't just memorable for the fans. It was also incredible to be part of as a player. You would sit in the dressing room, look around you, and see the Ballon d'Or winner, the Spanish player of the year, the top scorer in La Liga, the best goalkeeper in the world.
- There aren't many who can take good free-kicks.
- Always when you reach the semi-final you want to reach the final, it does not matter where or whom you are playing against.
- If Messi were Brazilian, he would be a world champion.
- There are always more trophies to win in football.
- It's a shame, racism still exists.
- Some people don't understand that football is universal. It doesn't have a race or nationality. It's one group of people.
- I can bring Neymar to Real Madrid.
- When one talks about six coaches in four seasons something's wrong, something bad's going on.
- You know what, lots of people are bothered by how I am. They think I'm arrogant! That is the way I am - I'm a very happy man and I love to make people happy.
- It was a disaster. I need to play with freedom, and Hodgson didn't let me cross the halfway line.
- Beckham takes free kicks better than me. It is a joy to watch him take free kicks and he has proved that free kicks are not all about power.
- I used to practise my free-kicks a lot.
- I believe in not changing teams that are winning.
- I cannot compare myself to Zico, he is a phenomenon of Brazilian football. He has done wonders as player and coach.
