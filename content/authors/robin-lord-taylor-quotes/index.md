- My whole life, I heard, 'Jingle bells, Batman smells, Robin laid an egg.' It's all I heard throughout elementary school.
- I got my agents right out of school, and I booked my first commercial right away. It was always enough to not quit and do something else.
- I avoid conflict - like, any conflict - at all costs. I hate it. Even at a restaurant, if I get the wrong order, I'll just eat it anyway because I don't want to make an issue.
- I had a few comics, but I was by no means a huge aficionado. I was more of a 'Mad Magazine,' 'Calvin & Hobbes' sort of nerd.
- 'Batman Returns' was a huge movie and one of my favorites growing up. It's incredible.
- If people want to compare me to Danny DeVito, that's the biggest gift there is. I think Danny DeVito is fantastic.
- I live in a small apartment. There's only so much Batman memorabilia a guy can hang on to in New York City.
- I've seen all the Batman movies in the theater opening weekend. I was a big Batman fan, definitely.
- I grew up in a very 'Friday Night Lights,' sports-focused town. I did not play the sports. I was never bullied physically, but I was called names. I was also an overweight kid. I knew what it's like to feel like the other, to feel written off for things that were not in my control - my appearance, my interests.
- I wasn't as big a comic book aficionado as some of my friends, but I definitely had some Batman comics.
- I initially thought I would be an architect, maybe. So I went to architecture camp and quickly learned that I did not want to be an architect. I was like, 'No. This is not for me.'
- You move to New York. You want to be the biggest, most fully realized version of yourself you can be. A lot of that is fueled by this desire to not feel small, and to make a name for myself and establish myself in a way that wasn't expected of me.
- I'm very loyal. Sociable to a certain extent. Neurotic, too.
- I loved theater growing up, and my mom always took us to the touring productions that would come through town. We would go to Chicago all the time and see shows. I loved it.
- I'm used to being a supporting player in the background. All I ever wanted, at the very most, was to have a small part in something where people were like, 'Oh, right, that one guy, whoever he is, was pretty good in that.' That's all I ever really strived for or expected.
