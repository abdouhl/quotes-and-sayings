- It's always exciting to play characters who are obsessive because all their energy is so focused on that one thing and they're eccentric because of it.
- With today's mass media obsession, it's good to be able to raise awareness about our environment.
- When you take a character seriously, there's more room for comedy because you're not aware of how absurd you are.
- I love period dramas and language, but I love comedy as well.
- I can't do victim roles - it makes me sick.
- My mom was an environmental activist in Australia in the late '60s and '70s, and I guess I've inherited that awareness from her.
- I didn't actually have a prom. In Australia, we call them 'socials,' which is hilarious. I did always find them pretty awkward, because I went to an all-girls school.
- I have a background in theater. At the time I read 'The Loved Ones' script, I was playing Catherine the Great of Russia onstage. Straight after that, I played Stella in 'A Streetcar Named Desire' and Isabella in 'Measure for Measure.'
- What appealed to me about 'The Loved Ones' script was that it had this really theatrical element to it. I thought that the scope of this character is so broad, and there is so much fun to be had playing a crazy teenage loner. It was a great way to explore the delusions a mind can create.
