- I'm not one of those New Age types that believe 'it's all meant to be' and that our lives have been scripted by an invisible hand.

- I used to be incredibly afraid of public speaking. I started with five people, then I'd speak to 10 people. I made it up to 75 people, up to 100, and now I can speak to a very large group, and it feels similar to speaking to you one-on-one.
- Let planning be the springboard, so that spirituality can be our splash.

- I'd done all the things I thought a person had to do in order to be successful and fulfilled, like getting a great education and becoming a lawyer, and yet there was zero spark in my life. But there was no light-bulb moment. It was gradual. In the early 1990s, I decided to experiment and try some new ways of living.

- If we are paying attention to our lives, we'll recognise those defining moments. The challenge for so many of us is that we are so deep into daily distractions and 'being busy, busy' that we miss out on those moments and opportunities that - if jumped on - would get our careers and personal lives to a whole new level of wow.
- One of my favorite books is 'Man's Search for Meaning.'
- The relationship that tests/frustrates/irritates you the most actually is one of your greatest blessings. Why? Because it reveals to you the very beliefs/fears and false assumptions that most limit you.
- Everyone is influencing the people around them one way or another.
- By seizing the opportunities that disruption presents and leveraging hard times into greater success through outworking/outinnovating/outthinking and outworking everyone around you, this just might be the richest time of your life so far.

- As we produce work that becomes pure poetry, we impact and influence our teammates, we wow our suppliers, we inspire customers and strangers. And we lead our industry.
- The most important things in life have nothing to do with things.
- The fears you do not face become your walls. Most people in business, and in their personal lives, design everything so they can avoid doing what makes them feel uncomfortable. Yet any good business person knows we are not only paid to work, but also we are paid to be scared.
- Getting up early is one of the gifts I give myself.
- I get so many big ideas while I'm running and such clarity while I'm lifting weights. And staying fit keeps me happy and positive.
- Talk is cheap. Actions speak.
- Most of my ideas are based on the latest research on productivity, performance and mental mastery - that's why so many iconic companies bring me in to help them grow and win.
- The world needs many more dreamers. Unreasonable souls who fight the urge to be ordinary.
- If there are only three guys at the top of the organization handling things, it's the definition of a bankrupt company. In creating leaders without titles, we are going to have organizations with people at the helm putting forth their best.
- I'm pretty conservative. I believe that buying good quality is a good investment. I buy fewer things but of better quality.
- The people you can't stand can actually transform your life. And help you become happier, healthier, and more successful.
- Inner improvements create outer ones.
- A leadership culture is one where everyone thinks like an owner, a CEO or a managing director. It's one where everyone is entrepreneurial and proactive.
- Greatness comes by doing a few small and smart things each and every day. Comes from taking little steps, consistently. Comes from a making a few small chips against everything in your professional and personal life that is ordinary, so that a day eventually arrives when all that's left is The Extraordinary.
- Here's the thing: When you become brilliant at listening, people feel that you care about them. When they feel you care about them, they begin to care about you. And when people care about you, your success becomes a part of how they define their success.
- Victims recite problems. Leaders develop solutions. That might seem like common sense, but common sense is rarely common practice.
- Too many people start their day like a five-alarm fire. Instead, I teach people to start their day a little earlier than they usually do, and urge them to take the time to prepare, to practise, so when you get to work, it's show time and you're at your best.
- Leadership and greatness comes to those who follow-through. Who stand for near-flawless execution.
- One of my weaknesses is impatience. I just have this aching need to get great things done. Can't stand slow change.
- People fear leaving their safe harbor of the known and venturing off into the unknown. Human beings crave certainty - even when it limits them.
- Managers develop organisations; leaders develop people.
- Most organizations don't fall apart as a result of one big blow. Most relationships don't end because of one grand argument. Most lives don't fall to pieces due to one sad event. No, I suggest to you that sustained failure happens as the consequence of small, daily acts of neglect that stack up over time to lead to a blow up - and break down.
- If you're the smartest person you know, it's time to know some new people.
- Most of us are cut from the same cloth. We all can be a hero if we choose. And it just isn't that hard.
- Leaders understand that the real fight is the fight against time. There's so much to achieve in such less time.
- I was a litigation lawyer. That's all very logical. Become a litigation lawyer. Become successful. Have a nice office. But there was some pull inside of me saying, self-publish this book. I followed that intuition and it's been a great choice for me in my life.
- We live in a world where many of us have a lot of friends on Facebook but yet we have lost human connection.
- Be a warrior when it comes to delivering on your ambitions. And a saint when it comes to treating people with respect, modeling generosity, and showing up with outright love.
- I wish for a world where people understand that life is short. So today's the time to do big things.
- Cynicism stems from disappointment. Cynical and faithless people were not always like that. They were filled with possibilities and hope as kids. But they tried and perhaps failed.
- Transcending what terrifies you and finding freedom from fear is one of the primary pursuits of people rising to world-class, both in their work and within their lives.
- Your income reflects your self-identity. Your impact reveals your personal story.
- Don't always be so reasonable and practical and sensible that you refuse to seize glorious opportunities when they show up and push the envelope as to what's possible for you.
- This beautiful, messy, wonderful and volatile world of ours needs more heroes.
- You can't become a history-maker stuck in tiny thinking. You just can't.
- It's so easy to get caught up in the thick of thin things. So seductive to spend your finest hours climbing mountains that, at the end, turn out to be the wrong ones.
- If you've tried everything possible to get an outcome, and it just hasn't worked out as planned, stop trying so hard. Relax. Maybe the timing's not right. Maybe it wasn't in your best interests. Maybe while one door seems to be closing, another is opening.
- As for whether I am a 'new age guru', I am not at all. I help companies build employees who lead without a title and become high performers.
- No matter how busy I get or how much pressure is on my shoulders, a good workout makes me feel at ease. I come off the treadmill feeling relaxed, full of joy and with a sense of perspective over the issues on my plate.
- The business of business is relationships; the business of life is human connection.
- I try to work out daily in the morning hours. This drives up energy levels dramatically. You'll feel more inspired. And you'll need less sleep.
- We are influenced by the ideas we hear and the people we meet.
