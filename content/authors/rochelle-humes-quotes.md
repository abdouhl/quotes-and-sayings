- I've always loved interiors and the way a home can positively affect your life. Since I was very young, I've rearranged rooms, changed colour and pattern, and loved renovating and decorating my own homes as an adult.
- As soon as you have children, they become your strength.
- When I feel stress, I put my phone down. I'm quite strict, telling myself not to take anything else on. Then, in the evening when the kids have gone to bed, I'll treat myself to a hot bath.
- When Marvin and I are on a date night, we keep our phones in our bags. If you're out for dinner, enjoy it! I find it bizarre that you would pay for an expensive meal to just Snapchat through all of it.
- In the morning I'll have a juice to start off the day - that might be a fresh orange, but from the juicer. I like apple, carrot, ginger and I actually have celery straight sometimes.
- I want to encourage all kids to cultivate inner strength.
- I knew I didn't have post-natal depression because it wasn't all day, every day. But I felt very low. As a woman you think you should still be making dinner and looking nice. You think, 'I can do a million and one things.' But you can't.
- I feel like the days that I do work in the week I make really busy, so that the rest of the days when I'm at home with my little girl are chilled. That's my most important job.
- I'm a big fan of Zara. My best fashion bargain is a Zara body, they're a staple in my wardrobe and go with everything.
- I love Hailey Bieber and Rosie Huntingon-Whiteley's style. I am a big fan of neutral tones and Rosie nails it, so chic, so classic.
- My ultimate cheat meal, and my last meal if I was on death row, would be a roast dinner. I'm just such a Sunday roast fan. But I also want the dessert - I want the cheese board.
- I love knit dresses! You're instantly put together and they're super flattering.
- I'd really like to be a gymnast and be super flexible.
- We do all of our emails and stuff during the car journey back, as we live an hour outside of London. Then when we're home, we're home and that's it.
- If we're going for a date night that's what we'll have because I feel like it's the thing that I can't really cook myself. If I go out I want it to be something that I wouldn't do at home.
- I lie to my children every day. Just little things to get them out the door when the school run is happening. White lies.
- I grew up in a one-bedroom flat with my mum. She worked hard and then got a terraced house - nothing fancy. My mum always kept my feet on the ground.
- I just think everything in moderation. I've never been into diets and it can become an obsession for some people. At the end of the day, it's food. I really enjoy going out for dinner and everything I do socially revolves around eating.
- My family is my number one and then everything else follows suit. As long as family is first, then we juggle everything else.
- I love the innocent way my kids see the world.
- There are some things that are in you because of your DNA and some things that are a product of your environment and what you've been around.
- I think its important to be able to wear flats during the day and then if you'd decide, 'that's it, we're going to stay out now for the rest of the day', you can have a pair of heels in your bag and your outfit will still look good. Something that's day-to-night.
- For me, the most important thing to do is not over complicate things. When you're trying to put an outfit together, wear something easy wearing.
- When I get ready with my friends before going out, they will always do their base before their eyes. Whereas, my number one rule is to always apply your eye make-up first, followed by your base make-up. This way if the eyeshadow trickles down, you can wipe it away without ruining the rest of your face.
- It was so important to me to include a sustainable option within my Regatta collection - the brand is known for its incredible sustainability collections. I really try to reuse my outfits and remember that a piece isn't just for a one-off occasion.
- I don't want my children growing up in a world where they think that their heritage and skin colour could be judged negatively.
- Opening up about racism and my challenges was overwhelming as it reminded me that we still live in a world where racism is normalised and accepted.
- I'm not the biggest breakfast person - I'm more about lunch and dinner.
- My main thing is not being distracted, being present at dinner time. I'll make sure my phone's not there and I'm not replying to emails.
- If you're going dressier, something like the black dress from my Very collection is great, especially for a second date. It's perfect for meeting his friends, because it's nice and simple, but it has a cheeky waist to show him a little bit extra.
- I don't obsess over diet - life's too short to not eat the cake!
- I've never been that person who's into dieting, because I can't sustain it.
- You have to live within your means as you don't know how long it will last.
- I swear by jumpsuits, playsuits, maxi dresses, something you don't have to plan for.
- I did a diet once and it was awful and made me miserable - I would never do it again.
- I do like to always hear the male perspective because they have a very different view of what's hot to you.
- I've got one look that I always stick to when I'm doing my own make-up. It's warm, brown colours on the eyes, bushy brows, highlighted skin and a bit of bronzer. That's it really, and a nude lip.
- I think that everyone is here for a reason and a purpose, and it's your job to figure out what that is.
- Being cheated on didn't make me more insecure, it made me stronger because I know that it's not your fault. If someone disrespects you it's their problem, not yours; there's no point worrying.
- The things that we've done as a couple all started by accident. We got married and then we seemed to have loads of interest from people who were asking us to do bits and pieces and then we started presenting together, which really, was another accident but we enjoyed it so we carried on doing it.
