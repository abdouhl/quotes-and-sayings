- It's nice to have the creature comforts of home.
- At school I was a disaster academically but being involved in drama helped me to find another pathway into things.
- I loved the variety of acting: turning your hand to different things and bringing whoever you were to it. There is something almost amateurish about it that appealed to me.
- It must be every critic's dream when you're at something utterly intolerable to actually get up and intervene and make it stop.
- Never go dead for a second on stage. Even if you are doing nothing, do it actively.
- People always use power, that's the unsurprising thing. They use it to try to sleep with who they want to sleep with - women as well as men do that - but I don't understand violence.
- I played Benedick in 'Much Ado About Nothing' nearly 30 years ago at the RSC, alongside Susan Fleetwood as Beatrice, and I loved every minute.
- Be ambitious. The great actor, director and playwright Ann Jellicoe commissioned writers like Howard Barker and David Edgar, and put on magnificent, large-scale plays in Dorset that involved the whole community.
- It's important to take risks and challenge yourself. That's why I went into acting, really.

- What I loved about Edinburgh was being able to walk to work through a beautiful place.
- As so many people seem to have done, I kind of fell in love with Willy Brandt.
- Try not to worry about embarrassing yourself. That's a lifetime's task.
- I don't know who can constantly afford to go and see things. A play, which has five people in it and one set and it cost you 60 quid? And you're in a theatre that really hasn't had a great deal of money spent on it in the last 50 or 60 years? It's kind of weird.
- Of course I would like to be more famous. It offers more career possibilities. But then it can prove restrictive. Plus you get hassled when you go shopping.
- I began getting these terrible headaches and I thought 'Oh great, death.' But it was just tension and tiredness.

- Getting a good education was of immense importance to my parents.
- As soon as you have two small children, they take up a lot of time and energy.
- I'm not conscious of having changed my accent.
- I remember once about 10 years ago when I was injured, having to rehearse, and I was walking with a stick. And I was terribly touched by the amount of people willing to give up a seat. You often hear that London is so brusque and rude, but the grace with which people negotiate incredibly crowded spaces is something rather nice.
- My parents both came from working-class backgrounds, my father particularly. He came from a very poor family, 12 of them lived in a little three-bedroom terrace house in Fulham, it was very small with an outside loo and a tin bath on the scullery wall.
- I like to do a wide variety of things, and acting, particularly in the theatre, has given me that opportunity.
- I don't think there are roles that would attract me to do a long run in the theatre.
- It's curious that apart from the baroque ranting, 'Sarah & Duck' is very similar to 'The Thick Of It' - great characters, excellent writing and lots of humor!
- I was in 'Babes in the Wood' at the Citizens Theatre in Glasgow in the Eighties. I was the villain - the wicked Sheriff of Nottingham.
- I invented this wonderful death scene for Javert of going down on my knees and then leaning back like a limbo dancer to make it look as if I was falling off a bridge. I did it eight times a week for nearly a year and I've had trouble with my knees ever since - they don't even allow me to jog these days.
- Lots of people are astounded that I was in the first cast of 'Les Miserables.' Possibly because I look so incredibly youthful.
- Bizarrely, someone involved in the children's show 'Sarah and Duck,' which I narrate, recently found a coat with my name on it in a secondhand shop. It's the coat I wore as Theseus in the 'Dream.' So it's back in my possession after all these years, which is rather strange and wonderful.
- I was very proud of doing Falstaff, because it seemed to go well.
- Watching your children growing up makes you aware of time passing. You think, 'Oh, God, look at them now! He won't be like this for much longer.'
- 'The Judas Kiss' was really wonderful. I loved that it concentrated on just two events in Wilde's life, and Rupert Everett was top dollar.
- I suppose there's a particular kind of efficiency about coming from a theatre tradition. You don't make a fuss, and you're cheap.
- A lot of actors are relatively shy people, surprisingly, so acting is a way of not being shy - and being paid not to be shy.
- I don't get mobbed in the street or bothered. Well, people do stop and say nice things. 'I like 'Endeavour,' or, 'I loved The Thick of It.'
- There's a particularly British way of going about things that I rather like, which is very different to the American way. It comes out of the amateur rep tradition of actors thinking: 'Well, I'm only 26, but I'll put on a beard and have a go at King Lear.'
- I was nervous about a Corbyn government, although I would have supported it because a lot of the policies were good. I was far more nervous of a Conservative government but here it is, we've just got to deal with it.
- At one stage, I wanted to be a folk singer.
- But one of the satisfying things about performing a play is you know for that piece of time exactly what you're going to be doing. Your life has a physical pattern. There's something about the odd, repetitious nature of it that I find hugely relaxing. All the problems of life are taken care of for that bit of time.
- Practice, learn the lines, work hard, don't be too respectful. Sometimes we can get too hung up on the fact that the material of the play is very finely wrought language.
- I had a serious and rather drunken research session with the great Charles MacLean, who took me through the history of whisky and malts. I can't remember a thing about it now. In fact I don't think I remembered a thing about it the following morning. Very, very entertaining.
- Opera requires an enormous commitment. You must devote your whole life to producing that extraordinary sound.
- For me, acting is like a pool you dive into. If you're lucky, you find what you need, then get out again.
- In 1983 I was still playing small to middling parts.
- The things that impress you when you're a child have an incredible influence on your life.
- I've never been to Barcelona, I'd like to go there; also South America.
- I've been choreographed in various musicals before. So I'm not completely two left feet.
- Life will go on - until it doesn't.
- One of the great things about doing a play, repeating it over and over again, is that you can practice. And you can get really quite good at it for a while.
- That's the extraordinary thing about opera: it has the power to elicit a physical reaction. I don't know if I'd have been any good or not, but I do know that I was never committed enough to find out.
- It's glorious to get all your food shopping without having to set foot in Tesco.
- I have got a big deep voice, and that comes in useful for villains.
- Judi Dench told me to shut up once. I was probably going on and on about something, in the way that I do sometimes, so she was being a good friend.
- When I watch my sons play, I think, God, acting's the most natural thing in the world. They take the 'Star Wars' characters and say, 'Let's pretend that I'm Hans and you're Luke and that we're on this planet,' etc.
- Learn your lines so well that you never have to worry about them.
- You are in a strange world in pantomime, where you are allowed to step out and talk to the audience and do silly gags. Sometimes I feel like a cartoon character.
- Shakespeare is the best writing ever. It's incredibly rich, dense, expressive language.
- That's the thing with acting. There are always loads of people who are more successful, richer, more famous and seemingly able to do anything they want.
- My ballroom dancing skills are completely non-existent.
- I listened to a clip someone had put up of me singing 'I Am What I Am' in the musical 'La Cage aux Folles.' I thought I was absolutely dreadful. It's like when you see photos of yourself at parties - at the time you thought you looked so cool and glamorous but you just look a bit drunk.
- It's true you can end up as rich as Croesus but the thing I enjoy about acting is doing lots of different kinds of things.
- When the National Theatre was built, it was a public building. If you wander round that building now, there are bits hived off for people who pay more money. That's happening across the arts.
- I like the fact that in the theatre nothing is ever finished because you're going to do it all over again tomorrow, whereas in telly once it's wrapped and in the can, that's it.
- I had done some acting at school, but I wasn't particularly good at it. What inspired me was going to the Old Vic in the late 1960s and early 1970s, when the National Theatre was based there.
- My chin - I've got another one underneath the first one.
- In the theatre, there were plenty of people having sex all over the place - wanting to, and doing it quite successfully - but male violence? Personally, I have witnessed very little. Very, very little.
- I can do posh.
- In the early 1970s, I took singing lessons with John Hargreaves, a leading singer with English National Opera, when I was home from university.
- 'La Cage' has got a broad appeal. It obviously appeals to the gay community, but it's also a good, fun show that appeals across a broad audience, a great big mixture.
- I did hardly any academic work. I learnt a fair amount, though.
- With those long American TV contracts you think, 'yes, at the end of that I'd be rich.' But at the same time you feel inside you a kind of death, because I enjoy playing lots of different characters.
- I've had some bad reviews, but not as bad as the things I could imagine for myself.
- Many years ago, I was found in compromising circumstances in a dressing room by a security man. The other person was hiding.
- It's lovely going to Oxford, it's very difficult to film there as you're doing a period drama in a city which is very crowded.
- Theatre has been a part of my education as much as anything else.
- I remember as a student going to Covent Garden, where they took out the stall seats and you hunkered down on the floor - I heard Pavarotti in Tosca there, and the experience of being in that same room with that astonishing voice has never left me.
- What I don't believe is that DVDs or HD broadcasts can be a substitute for the real thing.
- The acting bug first bit when I went to see 'Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead' at the Old Vic.
- Corporate jollies are generally speaking the kiss of death to an audience.
- I have a glass of wine. Red. Generally when I'm cooking.
- People are just repeating mantras like, 'get Brexit done,' 'strong and stable,' 'dither and delay'. There must be a way of satirizing it, and I long to see it, but it's gone beyond 'The Thick of It.'
- I've been saying for about 20 years, 'When am I going to get my cop show?'
