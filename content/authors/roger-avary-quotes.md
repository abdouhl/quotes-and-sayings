- TV is designed a certain way where you have three, four days on stage and three or four days out. You're basically making a feature every seven days. You have to shoot an hour's worth.
- Bret Easton Ellis is a social satirist; I consider myself aligned with how he does things. Bret doesn't write about that which he loves about the world, he writes about what disgusts him. You'd be a disturbed individual if you came out and said, 'I love these characters'.
- I restore vintage Atari XY arcade video game machines.
- In some ways, I think 'Pulp Fiction' hurt cinema in a very, very minor, small way. It did a massive amount of good. But it also made it impossible to make a movie even remotely like it without someone comparing it to 'Pulp Fiction.'
- What is interesting to me about Vikings is that they were failed farmers.
- TV writing is tricky to navigate because you have so many different personalities - the actors, multiple producers.
- When you're a writer, you pull your life into your work. My first love is cinema. That's where I want to be judged.
- I've been playing the Wolfenstein games since I was a kid, and feel that their outlandish sensibility has deeply influenced my own writing and directing throughout my career.
- The basic philosophy of stoicism is that you have nothing real external to your own consciousness, that the only thing real is in fact your consciousness.
- 'XIII' is a spy show. I think the comic book is a little too similar to 'The Bourne Identity.' I tried to take it away from that. I believe there was, many years ago, before the Bourne movies, a lawsuit that made it so they couldn't be published in English.
- One of my very favorite television shows growing up was 'The Prisoner.'
- Incarceration didn't change me. In many ways, incarceration galvanized me. The totality of the experience helped me.
- I reveal too much of myself.
