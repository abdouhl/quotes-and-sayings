- Death is something that happens to others, you think, until it happens to you.
- If you need three adjectives to describe something, then you've probably chosen the wrong something.

- If you're going to believe in God, if you're going to take that leap of faith, as I do, then the God that seems the most comprehensible to me would be the God who set us spinning and said 'Good luck.'
