- I always had this fascination with superheroes. Who didn't love Hulk and Spider-Man?
- What happened with reggaeton is that many artists kept recycling the same sound. But there are a lot of reggaeton artists that are still in their prime - like Daddy Yankee - because they've chosen to continue growing, to offer people more than just reggaeton. That's where I learned to always be able to try something new and not be afraid.
- I just want people to know me.

- My dad is Dominican, my mother's Puerto Rican, and I got into bachata at the age of 10 or 11. When I started listening, it had a reputation for being music for hick people. I thought that had to be changed. I was born and raised in the Bronx, and I knew you make something cool if you're cool.

- My mother at a young age put me in bilingual, so my strength is really more in Spanish. Even though I live and I was born and raised in the States, you know, in the Bronx, in Spanish I get my point across. And when I'm writing music, when I'm doing music, it's easier for me, and I know exactly how to express myself.

- I grew up in my neighborhood with salsa, of course bachata, but also hip-hop, Nirvana - it was just like a mixed culture.

- I know what it is to be out entertaining millions and yet wanting to be home because you miss your loved ones.

- I grew up listening to bachata, to some of the greats of the genre. But it was very natural for me to create this type of fusion and to incorporate new beats.
- I don't tweet very much. I still believe in the mystery of an artist. I believe in going out when I'm ready to sell my product. A lot of artists are out there every day. But I remember the Julio Iglesiases, the Jose Joses - and it was about the music.
- When I was producing 'Formula Vol. 2,' I knew I needed to come hard with the features and do something I hadn't done with Aventura. Collaborating with Drake was definitely one of those big steps that helped bachata go to the next level.
- I create the music, and if this artist could complement this record, I reach out.
- If you think of any strange fusion with bachata, most likely, we've done it. It's bachata mixed with different elements. We don't follow any style.

- When I get on stage, I try to win my pay: to please and that people leave satisfied... being seductive has given me good results.
- Growing up, I was always trying to catch a great show. And that's where I learned an artist gets respect. That's what makes people talk.

- My biggest tunes - 'Eres Mia,' 'Llevame Contigo,' 'Propuesta Indecente' - they aren't featuring anyone but me.
- If you put out quality music, you're always going to be in a good place.
- I was born and raised in the Bronx, and growing up here, you would go down the block, and on one corner you would hear bachata, on another corner some salsa, and of course there was hip-hop and R&B all over the place. So for me, it is very organic to have these combinations.
- Once an artist makes his personal life public, he can't close that door.
- That's my goal: to get the world to know who Romeo Santos is. His music. My music. Even if they don't like it, I want them to know who I am.
- Usher is so innovative - he's a great performer, a great entertainer.
- I've got a superstar like Usher singing bachata, a tune featuring Lil Wayne. I'm offering people more than just bachata. That captures a new audience that would listen to bachata because Usher is singing.
- I would always talk with my friends in English and Spanglish, but it was more like slang. It was more like, 'Yo, what's up, dog?' But in Spanish, I know what's proper, and what's ghetto. I know the difference.
- I want to touch people's lives with my music and my lyrics.
- I joined the church choir because there were these two hot chicks. Then people started giving me compliments. 'You really have a good voice.' Really? I just joined the choir for these girls.
- I believe that if each one of us have successful solo careers, it can only help the group's growth. It will allow the fans to see individual talent and make them appreciate us more. After all, we are in this for the long run and have every intention of returning with another album as Aventura.
- Many artists would want a major label. But, if someone made you big, it doesn't mean they're no longer good enough when you get big. If you want to add, add. But don't get rid of your original team.
- I feel like the best relationships I've been in are those where things were more laid-back.
- My love life is good, and I feel like part of what's made it good is not talking about it.
- I'm always onstage, and everyone there already loves me, so I go with this certain confidence.
- If I'm performing in the United States, I'm able to speak Spanglish, and the crowd comprehends. If I'm in the Dominican Republic or Puerto Rico, then I'm completely Spanish. I feel like a New Yorker that represents all Latinos.
- I think people look at me different when they see I'm dressed well. They pay attention. They know I'm about something.
- I love performing in New York. Just something about the energy that the crowd gives you, you give it back, a lot of interaction.
- People know me for my work with Aventura, and for that, I am grateful.
- Part of my success with urban bachata is reinventing yourself as an artist and continuing to give people different kind of fusions, mixing up the elements and concepts without changing the beat.

- I never think about any of my accomplishments and I always get butterflies in my stomach and I never get too comfortable with the status.

- I basically try to give people top quality.
- I definitely need a girl that has a good sense of humor because there are some girls that are just very uptight.

- I want to sell music. That's all I'm interested in selling.
- English is my first language, but musically speaking, I write my music in Spanish.
- I try to transmit emotion and soul in my voice, but my true passion has always been writing. I feel more like a writer than anything else.
- I'm not taking for granted being managed by Roc Nation. They have a lot of relations, and they have a reach that I clearly could benefit from.
- My life is nothing like my videos. I'm definitely not walking around with lots of hot women, as I am in my videos.
- I've learned that you can do something great, but you have to continue reinventing yourself as an artist. So by the time someone else is copying your style, you have something else to offer your audience.
- I think you have a crossover when you are known to a wider audience and a different market. I've been able to sell out stadiums all over the world by doing my music. I'm lucky to be in that list without having done an official crossover. Now, will you hear me doing a little bit of R&B? Sure.
- My first meal when I wake up is five boiled eggs, egg whites, and a slice of whole wheat bread.
