- Becoming Netherlands coach could be a nice end to my career.
- I think it is always good to know what is happening around the club.
- It's all about the qualities of the players. The better the players, the easier it is for the manager.
- When I was a player it was not normal that I would cook at home but now that I have more time, I do sometimes. I like it, I like to cook and maybe sometime I would like to have some lessons.
- Daley Blind, Georginio Wijnaldum and Kevin Strootman too. They are examples of how you should behave as a top player.
- From what I saw in Spain and Germany most of the teams drop back and then they have all of the time to build up and have the movements. In the Premier League it is more physical and about set plays. It is more difficult.

- I don't step back, that's football. It's about winning.
- When I spoke to Everton, the plan, the project, the history of the club was interesting. If I didn't see ambition in Everton I wouldn't come to Everton and that's maybe a good message to all of the players.

- I'm in love with Barcelona, life there is fantastic. It was my best period playing.
- When you have Van Gaal in charge, it is a fact that there is fear in his team. The players have a fear for mister Van Gaal. That is not always good.

- There are so many other examples in the Premier League of players who are the best in their country and make a move because they are really ready for a level higher. If they come to the English top flight, it turns out they need a period to adjust in terms of pace, aggressiveness and physicality, especially as a midfielder.

- I don't read the comments of fans, no.

- Messi is the greatest, but he has always been surrounded by other great players.
- Coaching Netherlands remains one of my ambitions.
- It's an easy answer, as a manager, to say: 'I need time.'
- I like to play attacking football, but I think the big difference is that we expect a lot more from our strikers, to do more pressing and to keep compact. We like to play a high line defensively and press the ball.
- I know myself that I am a manager who really gives young players a chance when they deserve it.

- It is not always possible, but the best plan is always to keep hold of your best players.
- I played with Romario. Sometimes you think he's sleeping, then in one split second he's scoring. It's a big quality. That means a lot of concentration for defenders. He's always fast, always on the line of sight. That's his best quality.

- I don't speak about rumours every day in the press, because it's not necessary to tell everybody the same answer.
- If you win games you will have good possibilities to maybe play in Europe, you never know.
- Within 24 hours of my departure from Everton, I had already received the first offer. Then they kept coming, but I keep it all away from me.
