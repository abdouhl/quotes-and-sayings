- I think, more than anything, in times of crisis we should be shedding party labels.
- I'm a Republican; I'd say I'm a conservative Republican. My job as RNC chair is to elect Republicans all across this country.
- That's something I believe in as the Republican chair - that we have to continue outreach to every American because I firmly believe our policies and our principles and the way we govern is better for every American.
- I'm a suburban mom. I grew up in Oakland County, Michigan.
- We don't just show up at election time; we're there full time.
- We have to keep this new coalition of Trump voters engaged. And they represent Democrats, more independents, and people who hadn't voted for a long time because they lost their faith in government.
- The House Intelligence Committee and the Senate Intelligence Committee are investigating everything having to do with Russia, and I expect we will find there is nothing there when it comes to the Trump campaign.
- Nobody thinks more of James Comey than James Comey.
- Independents come back, usually right before an election. They tune out, and then they start refocusing.
- Between 2012 and 2016, Donald Trump earned 14,000 more votes than Mitt Romney did in Detroit. It was wonderful to have a candidate in our party come to Detroit and campaign and actually show up and invest time there even though he probably didn't think he was going to win Detroit.
- During three decades' worth of sexual harassment allegations, Harvey Weinstein lined the pockets of Democrats to the tune of three quarters of a million dollars.
- I'm calling for an end to the investigations about President Trump's campaign colluding with the Russians. There's been no evidence of it. I don't think that should continue.
- Republican-led reforms would help Americans purchase their own coverage through the use of tax credits and expanded health savings accounts so that they can get a plan that works for them, not a one-size-fits-all plan forced on them by the government.
- Donald Trump has added a whole different factor that we've never seen before, but the audience loves it.
- Americans across the country are expressing their belief that the best chance for a better life in our country is with continued Republican control of the House, Senate, and the White House under President Trump.
- We must use our seat at the table to be a voice every day for women and girls across the country who often do not have the same opportunity to have their voices heard. This means advocating for childcare and paid family leave, as first daughter Ivanka Trump has championed in this administration.
- I am good at raising money.
- The only group that is less self-aware than Hillary Clinton is the media.
- The Republican party is not the party for the wealthy. We care about everyone.
- I was 19 when my mom ran for Senate, and it was a pretty tough race. And you walk awa,y and you think, 'I don't know if I want to be part of that world'.
- It's very easy to unite a party around opposition or wanting to get the White House back. That's a unifying message, and you're seeing the Democrats uniting around being the party of 'no' and the party of 'resist.'
- If there were things I felt the White House needed to be doing differently, I'd probably call them. I have a saying, and I had this in Michigan as chair, which is, 'We're a family.' When you have a difference of opinion in your family, you don't go on 'Jerry Springer'; you pick up the phone, and you call your family member.
- Donald Trump is a champion of women. He recognizes that we add to the conversation, and that certainly something as Republican Party chair I'm going to be reaching out to women all across this country.
- I hate generalizing. But what I've seen, from what I've observed, fundraising's an issue for women candidates.
- The future is female right now in the Republican Party. Kellyanne Conway just ran the first successful presidential race in history as a woman. I am the second woman ever to lead the Republican National Committee.
- For far too long, Democrats have hailed themselves as the party of women. As Republicans, we know their so-called monopoly on being the party of women is false, and it is a mindset I intend to change.
- I ask people who they vote for sometimes. I think it is just trying to get to know somebody.
- We do need to get to the bottom of what Russia did and their interference in the election. And we need to also figure out how the Obama administration failed so miserably to allow Russia to have this type of impact in our country.
- Women are very comfortable giving to charities or things they believe in, but not as much political givers.
- If you see someone on a plane with an eye mask, sleeping, that's probably me, because that's pretty much where I live.
- There is no fairness out there. There is no balance in the media.
- The RNC, per our bylaws, cannot engage in primaries. That is not our role. We actually have a rule that prohibits us from picking a candidate in the primaries.
- I think our country will keep Republicans in the majority.
- The recount in Michigan is over. The election is over. Our next president is Donald J. Trump. Winning once was nice. But winning twice was huge.
- My job is to unite everybody, bring everybody back together.
- Donald Trump has created a movement; my job is to keep momentum behind it, keep it growing for the 2018 challenge.
- Our national security is in a place where even my kids are concerned about things like ISIS when they hear about terrorist attacks on American soil.
- On the House side, typically the party that has the White House loses the majority in the midterms - that's been the historic trend. We want to buck that trend. We want to deliver for President Trump majorities in the House and the Senate so that he can govern.
- I'm going to support the candidate that the voters chose. The voters get to choose who's best to represent them.
- I'm a firm believer if you do the right thing, the American people will notice.
- The Democratic Party has become the party of the coastal elite, and the Republican Party is the party of the working class and that average American citizen who's been struggling over the past eight years with Obama in the White House.
- I was proud of President Trump for sticking up for the American taxpayer and saying it's time for you to shoulder your burden. You are not fulfilling your promise that you made to NATO. And you need to step up to the plate.
- We were promised we could keep our healthcare plans. We were promised that Obamacare would not raise middle class taxes. Instead, the law brought the American people rising premiums, unaffordable deductibles, fewer insurance choices, and higher taxes. We were let down.
- They said a Republican could never win Michigan. I knew better, you knew better, and Donald Trump knew better. We all know - never underestimate Michigan.
- A lot of times, with campaigns or parties, things are cyclical. We need a long-term strategy on how we continue to engage that goes beyond chair to chair. Always, you are balancing resources with your strategy because you have to win elections.
- It's very unfortunate to see the amount of obstruction the Democrats have put forward. There has not been a point since the beginning of President Trump's term that they have said, 'Let's come to the table. Let's work with you.' Even when they see their own constituents suffering because of their failing healthcare.
- The Affordable Care Act was not affordable. The Affordable Care Act is not affordable.
- I am a mom from Michigan. I am an outsider. And I am going to do everything I can to make sure Donald Trump and Republicans everywhere are successful.
- If we can find a way to enforce our laws and keep people from coming into our country illegally while maintaining a strong legal immigration system, I think that's going to benefit everyone. If you come here illegally, and you commit a crime, you're not going to be able to stay in our country.
- For a period of time, my grandmother, Lenore Romney, and my mother, Ronna Romney, were the only two women in the Republican Party to ever secure the nomination for Senate. And they were leaders. They were pioneers in our party.
- Donald Trump has added a whole different factor that we've never seen before, but the audience loves it. We've seen the energy around our state, so many crowds coming; it's good for democracy to have so many people engaged.
