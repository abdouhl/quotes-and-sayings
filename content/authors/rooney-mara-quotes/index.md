- I've always been a very sensitive person, and people tell me that if I'm in a certain mood, and I go into a room, my mood will permeate the room. It's not on purpose - I'd rather be invisible in those moments - but I'm really bad at faking how I feel.

- When I do a film, I follow the director.
- Now I literally roll out of bed and put on whatever is there. I have really enjoyed being a boy this last year.
- On 'Girl With the Dragon Tattoo,' I spent two or three months learning how to ride a motorcycle. I wasn't really riding the motorcycle in 98 percent of the movie, but the shots of me getting on and off had to look like I had been doing it for years and years.
- The more people know about you, the less they can project who you are supposed to be. It's unfortunate that you really only get one shot at that.

- How do we get to equality? I don't think it comes from fear. I think it comes from understanding.
- I feel like I've been guarded since I was about three years old. I don't know why. I come from such a huge family, so maybe it's that. Maybe it comes from going to Christmas and having 30 people all in your face at once. I've always been a bit like, 'Aaargh!'
- I love to read. I'm still pen pals with my ninth-grade English teacher, Mr. Shanley. He tells me what books to read.
- As an actor, you can't just be in the film. You're also in charge of selling it, and so you have to sell yourself, and you have to be very political and make sure to not say the wrong things. It's exhausting.
- I guess I don't really measure myself by what others think. So even though I have gotten to work with some amazing directors, and you might perceive me to be that girl, that isn't how I see myself. So if one day nobody wants to work with me, it won't be this massive surprise.
- If there is one thing about my family that I do identify with, it is that everyone is extremely hardworking. Also, the people whom I grew up with all did things they really loved. And I think that's an important lesson.
- It never seemed that honorable to me, and I guess I was always afraid that I might fail.
- I never do anything for the camera. It's my job to pretend the camera's not there. I'm never moving for the camera.

- I've been trying to really live in the moment because I will never get this part of it back. As soon as the movie comes out, everyone will turn it into what they believe it is, so I've really been trying to appreciate every minute of now. Because I know what's coming.
- People think that I grew up going to Barneys for my back-to-school clothes. I went to the Gap. We lived in a nice house on a cul-de-sac, but it wasn't a mansion. We didn't have a butler or a maid.
- I try to eat food that hasn't been washed in ammonia and then packaged in the shape of breaded dinosaurs filled with cheese - even though those are very tasty. I like to eat food that can actually make it through the 20-plus feet of my small intestine.

- One of the things that make our version that much more heartbreaking is that even though I am playing a 24-year-old I look much younger. I look like a child.
- When I was at college, my nickname was Keds because I wore Keds. I guess it wasn't really a nickname, because nicknames are usually given to you by people who are your friends and who know you. But I didn't know the people who called me Keds. I think that they didn't like me because I didn't want to join a sorority.
- Marion Cotillard is one of my favorite actresses.
- It's really hard coming of age in today's society, where society wants you to make the decision of what you want to do with your life by the time you're 16 years old. Most kids don't know what they want to do. How could they? They haven't lived in the real world yet.

- I pick up energy really easily. Even if I go to the grocery store, and no one is paying attention to me, I can pick up other people's moods, and it's really intense.

- I'm probably more insane than most people and less than a lot of others. I'm somewhere in the middle.
