- I grew up on a set and saw my family doing it and thought, 'I can do that too.'
- Just live life. That's the best way to learn how to act. Just live.
- People who work with me think I should cut my hair. They say casting directors are less likely to hire me with long hair - that they don't have imaginations and can't picture me looking normal. People literally have conference calls about my head when I'm not around. I mean, obviously I would cut my hair for an amazing part.
- John Hawkes is amazing. I really want to meet that man; he's so good. Him and Ben Foster, and I'm a big fan of Nick Stahl - those are my three guys.
- I did this movie called 'Lymelife' when I was 18, and you know, it was the first time I was working as an adult, a legal adult, and that was a huge growing experience for me.
- I'm not a solid enough actor to have techniques.
- When I was little, acting opportunities were always proposed to me as 'a favour.'
- When I was younger, I actually had a ghost face mask, and I stood in my sister's room in the corner for, like, half an hour until she saw in the reflection, me behind her, and she freaked out and started slapping me.
- I think we all miss our childhood.
- I was the ghost-faced killer for Halloween in the third or fourth grade.
- If I'm reading a script, and I'm not buying it, I need to be able to relate to the character on some level, and they need to have more than one dimension. I need to have an idea of what this guy's thinking about when he's taking a shower not on camera. And if I can't picture him taking a shower and getting dressed, then he's not a real person.
- I only work once or twice a year for about a month, so I have a lot of free time. But I'm good at being alone, which helps.
