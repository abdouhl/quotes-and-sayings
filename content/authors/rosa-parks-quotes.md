- I don't think well of people who are prejudiced against people because of race. The only way for prejudiced people to change is for them to decide for themselves that all human beings should be treated fairly. We can't force them to think that way.

- I was born 50 years after slavery, in 1913. I was allowed to read. My mother, who was a teacher, taught me when I was a very young child. The first school I attended was a small building that went from first to sixth grade. There was one teacher for all of the students. There could be anywhere from 50 to 60 students of all different ages.
- I have never been what you would call just an integrationist. I know I've been called that... Integrating that bus wouldn't mean more equality. Even when there was segregation, there was plenty of integration in the South, but it was for the benefit and convenience of the white person, not us.

- There is just so much hurt, disappointment, and oppression one can take... The line between reason and madness grows thinner.

- In it not easy to remain rational and normal mentally in such a setting where, even in our airport in Montgomery, there is a white waiting room...

- I talked and talked of everything I know about the white man's inhuman treatment of the Negro.
- Each person must live their life as a model for others.
- I had felt for a long time that, if I was ever told to get up so a white person could sit, that I would refuse to do so.
- I have learned over the years that when one's mind is made up, this diminishes fear; knowing what must be done does away with fear.
