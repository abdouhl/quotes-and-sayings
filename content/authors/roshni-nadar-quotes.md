- The largest expense in our philanthropy is capital expenditure because we are building these institutions. This institution-building idea stems from my father because he has the experience of building a company from scratch.
- I am privileged to have the kind of platform I do and the kind of support I do. A lot of women in this country don't have that.

- Most of India is rural; there is a huge population in India not being tapped for their excellence. They have no access to great universities.

- As a first-generation inheritor, the first mandate is to preserve our family wealth and hopefully increase it.
- Philanthropy is all about sharing. If there's an opportunity to collaborate, we will. Collaborating just for finance is pointless. It has to be like a business collaboration.
- Of course I have my father guiding me, and I have people who I have actually grown up with and who advise me.
- Having such high-profile parents could be intimidating, but really, they've let me do my own thing and evolve as a person. When I changed my major from economics to film, they were cool about it.
