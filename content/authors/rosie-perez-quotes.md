- You know, you may not be born in Puerto Rico, but Puerto Rican is definitely born in you.
- As an actor, you may do things that aren't politically correct. Unless you're an actor who only does things for political reasons. I believe if we don't do the good, bad, and the ugly, we're not going to progress.
- Certain people who care about me a lot have said 'You don't play the game, and if you don't play the game, you don't get picked for the team all the time.
- I have a picture of all of us going to a club with my friends from 'Soul Train.' All the girls just going out to a nightclub, and we're all dressed like we were dressed on 'Soul Train.' It was the most surreal experience for me because I walk into the club with them, and people started screaming. 'Oh my God! It's the 'Soul Train' dancers.'
- I think I just have this need to be a storyteller. That's why I wasn't a great dancer - I couldn't articulate a story. I was a better choreographer. I have the need to to just express myself in that way. I can't explain it.
- I did not try to conform to anybody's ideal of what a Latin celebrity or movie star should be. I took a lot of hits for it.
- For some reason, I always thought I was special. And for some reason, I always thought that I had a purpose in life: that I was supposed to contribute to the world.

- Therapy is not a 'white thing.' It's a clinical thing.
- I knew I was going to be successful from day one. From day one. That's why it throws me whenever someone says it was such a fluke that I was successful.
- I have this tough exterior, but inside, I'm very mushy and soft.
- I see explicit covers on magazines, and they're getting even more explicit, and it's like, Are women being empowered, or is this just what sells magazines? Are they feeling pressured, or have they really come into themselves and are saying, 'I am woman, hear me roar?'
- Hollywood's racist.
- In movies, you shoot out of sequence, so the issue of reality is really taken out of it.
- In Broadway, we do love jazz hands.
- The racism, the sexism, I never let it be my problem. It's their problem. If I see a door comin' my way, I'm knockin' it down. And if I can't knock down the door, I'm sliding through the window. I'll never let it stop me from what I wanna do.
- I started lying about my age when I was 18 to be older. When I turned 21, I started lying that I was 18. It's a weakness in me.

- I don't call myself Latin, I call myself Puerto Rican.
- A lot of women feel ashamed to be weak.
- Don Cornelius gave me an incredulous look regarding my accent. I lessened it; he gave a nod of approval. Instantly, I felt ashamed. I had made my first conscious effort not to sound ethnic.
