- The most frustrating thing at Villa was the perceived view fans had of me, that certain people at the club painted. That of a mercenary who was happy sitting on the sidelines taking his wages.
- But what I say to people who don't know me and listen to people who say I'm a bad egg or whatever is that I was club captain at Fulham and club captain at Leeds.
- I'm not sure about English football to be honest with you. There's a lot of politics down there and I'm not sure it's just about your attributes on the park. If it was I'd still be down there.
- Despite what some people think, I never asked to leave. I'd just been made captain of Leeds which in my eyes is a big, big deal.
- As a family, we were settled in London. The kids loved their schools.
- I'm not the kind of guy who wants to basically collect money and do nothing.
- Coming to Motherwell is a good chance for me. The kids will get to see me play.
- I know Leeds have had a few Scottish captains but I don't look too much to that because you can get lost in the history of the club. There's so much good history but it's all about the present and the future.
- Until I went to Aston Villa I was scoring 'X' amount. It just did not happen there. That is it. I have seen it happen with loads of players.
- I've always been a bubbly guy who wanted to mix and have some banter when the time is right.
- When you're with your kids everything else takes a back seat.
- I can never shut the door on Aston Villa but I think it's blatantly obvious for everyone looking at it that it's done.
- There's not one person at any club I've been at who would turn around and say I'm a bad egg, it's only been at Aston Villa. That speaks volumes.
- Have you ever heard of a club captain who's a bad egg? Me neither.
- I've definitely seen a lot of good players since I've came to Australia and I've definitely seen a lot of players that could easily play in the Championship in England.
- Aston Villa were signing this player and that player, and I was thinking this is my chance to get to the Premier League. I was a little bit over-eager to join them.
- But I was club captain at Leeds, club captain at Fulham. If you've got a bad attitude you're not getting those honours.
- As captain I enjoy the responsibility. Even when I didn't have the armband I was doing a lot outwith the club so it has been an easy transition.
- Hindsight is a wonderful thing, but I was maybe too quick to leave Fulham.
