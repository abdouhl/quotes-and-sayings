- I would love to do anything involving a good strong character, whether it's in film, TV or theatre. My dream role's already been taken by Keira Knightley in 'Pride and Prejudice.' Growing up, I really wanted to be Lizzie Bennett.
- I don't believe there is one most romantic act that a guy can do; I think it is all about the couple in question, which totally differs. It's about you thinking about the person you are with and doing something tailored and thoughtful for them.
- If I could have any power, I think flying would definitely be up there! Along with speaking every language.
- I think you should aim for the stars - and hopefully avoid ending up in the clouds!
- I'd live in Glasgow if I could. I can't praise it enough; it's the nicest place I have ever worked and I've worked in a lot of nice places.
- I didn't want to do all of the mags, and we didn't get paid for those shoots - 'Hollyoaks' took the fee. But I couldn't say no to everything. I felt lucky to have the job I was doing, so I went along with it. And when I did 'Maxim,' I knew that stars like Eva Longoria had also been on the cover, so I was in good company.
- I'm not religious. I would say I'm more spiritual than religious.
- My mum certainly isn't a prude, nor is my brother, so I think I'm lucky to have a family like that.
- I criticise myself an awful lot. I do worry to the point that I don't think it's very healthy. I'm always picking my flaws. It's a terrible anxiety I have. I wish I could pretend nothing fazes me, but it does.
