- Business and the state have a common interest; not an adversarial interest.
- After all, I have spent the better part of my adult life insisting that government be open... that government be accessible... and that government be held accountable to people who voted us into office.
- What I am proposing this year are not lofty concepts far removed form the daily struggle so of ordinary Georgians. They are proposals that directly effect the lives of the people we serve.
- Repeating a grade needs to be the last resort, not an automatic response to a child who is struggling to learn.
- We will never forget those like my great-grandfather who fought at Vicksburg.
- There is no country on earth with a stronger tradition of protecting the public's right to know.
