- I ended up signing for IndyCar and it was a good decision. I should have waited another 10 days to actually talk to all of the teams, because I just went in, boom, I got the first offer and I said OK I'm racing. It's almost like it was the girlfriend just gives you a no and then you just get the next one that gives you a yes.

- I had other proposals and I was talking to people but then I decided that staying at Ferrari would give me my best chance of winning the championship.
- I am in constant contact with the factory on a daily basis by phone. I speak to many people: to Ross Brawn and to Jean Todt and my race engineer. I have many sources I can speak with to find out what has been happening.
- But when you are focused on your job, if you know you have given your very best, no matter where you finished, then that is great.
- I am so competitive I cannot imagine myself without a racing car.
- At Ferrari they didn't give me the space, and at Honda I had the space but I didn't have the machinery.
- Nineteen ninety-five, when I was still with Jordan, was the lowest moment. It was my third season and the travel was getting to me and I was missing my family. I felt under a lot of pressure and even thought of going to America - to race there.
- Your objectives change throughout your career and with more experience you kind of use the energy for the good stuff and you don't burn energy for the wrong stuff.

- I eventually wanted to do Stock Cars, because it was my dream as a child, after I have done Europe, I have always liked to see the Stock Cars.
- First of all you need to have speed. If you only have experience and don't have the speed, then you are never going to get the speed. This is the main point. So you are better off getting someone quick and you develop him with experience.
- I don't care about the future. I feel the future always reserves enough good things for you if you stay open and you smile.
- I am very excited to confirm I will be at BAR. I wish to thank Ferrari for six fantastic years.
