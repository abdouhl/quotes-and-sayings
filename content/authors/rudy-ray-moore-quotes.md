- When I first realized that I wanted to be a stand-up comedian was when I was in the service.
- I opened the door for one of the great stars of today, Mr. Ernie Hudson. I put him in 'Human Tornado.' It was the first film he ever made. I put him in the film and gave him a break.
- I didn't have the kind of budget to compete with the big studios, therefore I had to make my films more outlandish, more outrageous.
- Snoop Dogg has had me to Hollywood to rap with him on his records, and the 2 Live Crew brought me to Miami and wined and dined me to make a record with them.
- Back in the 1970s, it was mostly all-black audiences coming into the theaters. So, we presented stories they could relate to.
- I've been sampled at least 71 times. Me, James Brown and George Clinton, we're the ones who've been sampled the most.
- The godfather of rap, that is what I am known as, and the king of party records, the records I do.
- Busta Rhymes, I have to give him credit for one thing: he always lays the red carpet out for me when I'm in New York.
- When I did rap and rhyme, it wasn't just a word that rhymed with another one.
- I have to thank my mother for this. When I was a little boy she used to teach me poems. I would go in church and tell the poems in church for the Easter program, and again for Mother's Day and any occasion she felt would fit. I was very energetic with delivery at that time as a boy, so it stuck with me.
- I never was in favor of doing this. No, no, no. I was never in favor of cursing on records and so forth. I wasn't brought up like that. But I needed to survive and make money and get me a piece of show business. So when I found I could hit with this, then I turned to it. And in order to turn to it, you must do it well.
- These guys Steve Harvey and Cedric the Entertainer and Bernie Mac claim they're the Kings of Comedy. They may be funny, but they ain't no kings. That title is reserved for Rudy Ray Moore and Redd Foxx.
- Cleveland is always in my heart.
- I have become their idol. Like, Busta Rhymes has called me twice to come to rap with him, and Big Daddy Kane and Eric B and Rakim, I made a trip to do things with them.
- This was my motto: 'Don't come up with routine stuff.'
- Luther Campbell is the only person that has ever paid me for sampling me. I'm out for the rest of 'em, but the young man paid me.
- You know, I hope that someday they make a movie about me. People need to know the story of 'Dolemite;' they need to know my story.
- My childhood was all about going to church, singing in church. And later on, after I got a little older, my mother taught me how to do poems for Easter and Mother's Day, recitals and so on. I got attached to that, so as I got older and older, I began to recite poetry.
- I am a spiritual, God-fearing man just playing a ghetto expressionist.
