- I've just started school again, and it was a bit strange to start off with; it took me three or four days to get used to it. My friends have been great, they've been treating me normally.
- I always wanted to go into acting.
- I like all Jim Carrey films. They're really funny.
- We had a script reading, and that's where we met J.K. Rowling, which was really exciting.
- We just started filming, and after every scene was shot, we had a rehearsal for the next one.
- They were just kind of simultaneous - the film ending and the sets being destroyed. I was struck the first time I saw the Great Hall become a big pile of burning rubble and getting scattered around. It's really quite shocking for the fans.
- I was always a big fan of the books and over the years I've become quite attached to Ron and we've meshed into the same person, really.
- I found out that you could audition by sending a picture of yourself and some information to Newsround.
- Leave home? It's quite a scary thought. I'm not the most independent person and that's the result. When you're always surrounded by people it becomes quite normal.
- Ron was always my favorite character, because I feel like I relate to him, like we've both got red hair, we both like sweets, we've both got lots of brothers and sisters.
- It's not that I find it hard to meet girls - they do come up and chat me up from time to time. Sometimes I'm interested, I tend not to go for the prettier ones. I prefer the quirkier types.
- I get recognised sometimes, and that's really cool. I've tried certain disguises, but that doesn't work.
- I was really nervous. Even when I left the audition I was nervous.
- After being in Harry Potter, I believe a bit more in magic than I did before.
- I do, kind of, spend a lot. And just on stupid things. Because I don't really know what to do. What are you supposed to do? Um. It just seems like way too much. We don't deserve it, at all, for what we do.
- I went out with people, but never anything too serious. It wasn't that easy. Now it's something I'm really looking forward to.
- Well one of the times I did a stunt was in the devil's snare room and they lifted me up on a harness and a safety rope really, really high, and they just dropped me down into the devil's snare.
- But I like all the books. You've got to read them all to get the complete Harry Potter experience.
- I think coughing up slugs was quite hard. Ron has a scene where he has to cough up these giant slugs.
- I've never been seriously involved with anyone. I've certainly never been in love. I've always preferred to keep things casual.
- Being famous is wicked. But it's better to be normal.
- We had a dialogue coach. She helped us with our T's.
- I am a really big Harry Potter fan and I've seen all the sets, I've lived Harry Potter and I don't think it's destroyed the books at all, I think it's really spot on.
- One in the third film, I'm looking forward to meeting one of the Dementors.
- Every time I come off-set, I am just like a normal kid again.
- It's always at the back of my mind that acting might come to an end for me when Harry Potter finishes. I don't know if I'm good enough to have a long career. I've got a bit of an inferiority complex about my acting. My self-esteem is quite low in that sense.
- Well, before I knew there was going to be a film. I was the biggest Harry Potter fan. I read all the books.
- People recognize me, call me Ron, and ask me questions. It's really cool and weird as well.
- I'm shorter, I don't have as many freckles as Ron, and I can't do magic.
- The characters in the book grow up with us. My voice has broken as well.
- Don't have a favorite subject, I think I want to carry on doing this because I really enjoy it.
- I'd like to levitate.
- I'd like to have the flying car, I think that'd be really cool.
- I want Ron to stand up to Malfoy and punish him.
- I've known Emma Watson since she was 9, we've watched each other grow up, formed this sort of brother/sister bond, and suddenly I'm leaning in to kiss her. Well, it felt completely wrong... but, you know, you try to sink into the character and divorce yourself from it. We ended up laughing hysterically afterwards.
- For me the stunts are so cool, they're one of my favourite things when we're doing the film.
- I've never fancied that footballer lifestyle. I suppose I could live that kind of flash life. People stereotype child actors and kind of expect you to go off the rails a bit, be a bit crazy, but that's not really happened yet. I've got a big family so that helps, and they live really close to the studios so it's just so much easier.
- So yes, I do want to try and keep things going if I can. I have a few things brewing... And if it doesn't happen, I did buy an ice cream van a while ago. So I always have that to fall back on.
- Yeah, my parents help me keep my feet on the ground.
- In terms of filming, yes, it really does feel over now. There's a real sense of freedom now. It's a good time to finish, I think. As much as I'm going to miss it I'm ready to move on and do different things.
