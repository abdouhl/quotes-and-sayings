- The buck stops with the guy who signs the checks.
- The cold, commercial word 'market' disguises its human character - a market is a collection of our aspirations, exertions, choices and desires.
- In a world as competitive as ours, the child who does not get a decent education is condemned to the fringes of society. I think all Australians agree that this is intolerable. So we must demand as much of our schools as we do of our sports teams - and ensure that they keep the Australian dream alive for every child.
- We all know growth is absolutely vital to a free society. No one should want Australia to be a stag-nation: a nation with a stagnant economy and stagnant aspirations.
- No one's going to be able to operate without a grounding in the basic sciences. Language would be helpful, although English is becoming increasingly international. And travel. You have to have a global attitude.
- In my life, I have learned that most people want the same thing. They are not driven by class resentment. What they want most is to make a better life for themselves and their families - and to know that the opportunities for their children will be better than they were for themselves.
- One thing I resent is the slur that I just support political candidates because of the business.
- Scarcely a day goes by without some claim that new technologies are fast writing newsprint's obituary.
- I'm not a knee-jerk conservative. I passionately believe in free markets and less government, but not to the point of being a libertarian.
- I am amazed that CNN can't get its act together.
- Much of what passes for quality on British television is no more than a reflection of the narrow elite which controls it and has always thought that its tastes were synonymous with quality.
- I now wear a Jawbone. This is a bracelet that keeps track of how I sleep, move and eat - transmitting that information to the cloud. It allows me to track and maintain my health much better.
- At News Corporation, we have a history of challenging media orthodoxies.
- Somebody talked me into writing an autobiography about six or seven years ago. And I said I'd try. We talked into a tape recorder, and after a couple of months, I said, To hell with it. I was so depressed. It was like saying, 'This is the end.' I was more interested in what the hell was coming the next day or the next week.
- People begin to resent the rich only when they conclude that the system is rigged.
- Money is not the motivating force. It's nice to have money, but I don't live high. What I enjoy is running the business.
- I try to keep in touch with the details... I also look at the product daily. That doesn't mean you interfere, but it's important occasionally to show the ability to be involved. It shows you understand what's happening.
- No leader will fight for values, for principles, if their government is a value-free vacuum. Moral relativism is morally wrong.
- We certainly employ a lot of immigrants at Fox... and we do not take any consistent anti-immigrant line.
- Now if you look at the London 'Times,' you'll find that with quite a number of the photographs, you touch them, and they turn into videos. I think newspapers come alive that way. We talk about 'papers.' We should cut out the word 'paper,' you know? It's 'news organizations.'
- Crony capitalism is not capitalism - it is cronyism.
- The CNN international is a different service - it is even more leftist and anti-American than CNN is. That's their business, that's fine, but it can't be getting any revenue. There is no cable network that I know of anywhere in the world other than in America that pays them for their products.
- My father left me with a clear sense that the media was something different.
- We've got to lift our game tremendously. We'll sell our business news and information in print, we'll sell it to anyone who's got a cable system, and we'll sell it on the Web.
- My worry about the New York Times is that it's got the only position as a national elitist general-interest paper. So the network news picks up its cues from the Times. And local papers do too. It has a huge influence. And we'd love to challenge it.
- Everybody at home speaks mandarin except me.
- Why would I spend $5 billion for something in order to wreck it?
- I was born in Australia and am proud of my Australian provenance, but I am now an American. Like so many naturalized citizens, I felt that I was an American before I formally became one.
- I think a newspaper should be provocative, stir 'em up, but you can't do that on television. It's just not on.
- It's been a long career, and I've made some mistakes along the way.
- We started Fox when everyone said it couldn't be done.
- So long as I can stay mentally alert - inquiring, curious - I want to keep going. I love my wife and my children, but I don't want to sit around at home with them. We go on safaris and things like that. I can do that for a couple of weeks a year. I'm just not ready to stop, to die.
- If you're in the media, particularly newspapers, you are in the thick of all the interesting things that are going on in a community, and I can't imagine any other life that one would want to dedicate oneself to.
- What's just about a generation of people who rack up government debt for their own health care and retirement - while leaving their children and grandchildren to foot the bill?
- A lot of people are very happy to read their newspaper either on their iPad or - startlingly and faster and faster the figures go up - on their telephone, on their smart phone.
- I'm a strange mixture of my mother's curiosity; my father, who grew up the son of the manse in a Presbyterian family, who had a tremendous sense of duty and responsibility; and my mother's father, who was always in trouble with gambling debts.

- I think you have a danger of regulating, putting regulations in place which will mean there will be no press in 10 years to regulate.
- ESPN is a very, very good operation, and it's a gold mine. It's an even bigger gold mine than Fox News.
- At its core, a fair and just society is one where opportunity is open to all - not just those at the top.
- Our reputation is more important than the last hundred million dollars.
- People who watch 'Fox News,' you may say, and this is anecdotal, but they are passionate about it. In the most unlikely places, like down in Soho where I used to live, people would come up to me and thank me for it. People I didn't know from a bar of soap. People appreciate that at least they're being heard. It is much more watchable.

- In motivating people, you've got to engage their minds and their hearts. I motivate people, I hope, by example - and perhaps by excitement, by having productive ideas to make others feel involved.
- The press is the only institution that is truly accountable. The founding fathers put the First Amendment first for a reason.
- CNN is pretty consistently on the left, if you look at their choice of stories, what they play up. It's not what they say. It's what they highlight.

- Climate change has been going on as long as the planet is here, and there will always be a little bit of it.
- It's a libel to say that I use my newspapers to support my other business interests. The fact is, I haven't got any other business interests.
- I'm a permanently curious person. I probably waste my time being curious about things that have got nothing to do with the business sometimes. What keeps me alive, certainly, is curiosity.

- I believe people will be watching their TV screens for a long time and that TV channels have a long-term life.
- When I hear something going wrong, I insist on it being put right.

- I'm not an economist and we all know economists were created to make weather forecasters look good.
- I can go into restaurants and a whole table will get up and clap if they recognize me, because they love Fox News. Other places - or even the same place - people will turn the other way.

- I think everyone's against abortion.
- I'm not ashamed of any of my papers at all and I'm rather sick of snobs that tell us that they're bad papers, snobs who only read papers that no one else wants. I doubt if they read many papers at all.
- I wasn't weaned on the web nor coddled on a computer. Instead, I grew up in a highly centralized world where news and information were tightly controlled by a few editors, who deemed to tell us what we could and should know. My two young daughters, on the other hand, will be digital natives.
- If the sea level rises 6 inches, that's a big deal... we can't mitigate that; we can't stop it. We've just got to stop building vast houses on seashores and go back a little bit.
- I feel that people I trusted - I don't know who, on what level - have let me down, and I think they have behaved disgracefully, and it's for them to pay. And I think, frankly, that I'm the best person to see it through.
- I'm not looking for a legacy, and you'll never shut up the critics. I've been around 50 years. When you're a catalyst for change, you make enemies - and I'm proud of the ones I've got.

- I don't mind what people say about me. I've never read a book about myself.
- Societies or companies that expect a glorious past to shield them from the forces of change driven by advancing technology will fail and fall. That applies as much to my own, the media industry, as to every other business on the planet.
