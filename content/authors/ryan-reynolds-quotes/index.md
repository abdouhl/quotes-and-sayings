- I've had the pretty good fortune of working with some decent guys and gals.
- 'Green Lantern' I screen-tested for twice. I fought for the role. And I'm glad I did, because I felt like I earned it.
- Character acting is a much braver pursuit than a guy who runs around and intermittently clenches his jaw muscles.
- If you're going to commit to that, you're going to have to find some way to make it bearable and enjoyable.
- My career has been an inch at a time.
- I'm terrified that I'm genetically predisposed to only having boys. That's frightening. By the time I was 10 years old, and I'm not exaggerating, I knew how to patch drywall.
- I remember being upset because I was finally legal to drink in Canada, and I decided to throw that all away and move to America, where I had to wait another two years. I came here to do improv and to try to join the Groundlings.
- My very worst day on 'Green Lantern' was nowhere near as difficult as my finest day on 'Buried.'
- I never took acting classes, but I knew I could do it based on the skill with which I lied to my parents on a regular basis!
- I played rugby for years, and I had a rugby jacket that I lost when I was 14. Somehow, my brother found it in storage 15 years later, and he gave it back to me for my 30th birthday. That was amazing and probably one of the best gifts I've ever received.
- Marathon running, for me, was the most controlled test of mettle that I could ever think of. It's you against Darwin.
- I think there's escapist moviemaking, and we want to be captivated and taken away. If it's done right, you can craft an incredible film. There have been superhero films that I think are brilliant pieces of art.
- Any kind of crisis can be good. It wakes you up.
- I think every relationship is going to go through a few rough patches. Those are what make it stronger, I think.
- I don't think you can help but personalize a role. You almost play to none of the preconceived notions of it. It's more or less a personal experience and journey.
- When I'm not training for a movie, it's more relaxed. I do a lot of running. Usually I'll run four to six miles about three times a week. You try to eat right, but you don't always.
- I'm not a hockey fan, which is probably why I had to leave Canada in the first place.
- When I meet thousands of fans of the comic - when I realize every one of them can recite the Lantern Corps oath ('In Brightest Day, in blackest night...') - I know how important this is to people.
- It was comical because you're at a firing range, all these people are so seriously shooting their little guns.
- I was a really nervous kid. I was extremely sensitive. Incredibly perceptive.
- I've always just liked working. I like being a working actor.
- If you ask me to describe my relationship, I mean - words are too clumsy to accurately describe how I feel in that regard, particularly in an interview. It's a strange thing.
- There's an old saying that you don't ever finish a movie, you abandon it, and I really believe that. I never walk away from a take and pat myself on the back.
- Guys are lucky: We can wear a suit over and over, just with different shirts and ties.
- I did as much as I could in Vancouver. You can only play so many ex-'Falcon Crest' sons in so many movies of the week before you burn out.
- I find that I get a little depressed if I don't move my body each day, so sometimes it's just as simple as walking, and other times it's training for a marathon or some kind of personal goal that I'm trying to meet.
- I grew up in Vancouver, British Columbia.
- You'd be hard pressed to find more drama in 'Days of Our Lives' than you do in an average job each day.
- I understand the climate we live in and why people are curious. But it's just tough and almost emotionally violent - for anyone, I think - to see your personal life summarized in a sentence.
- It's just that... working on 'Green Lantern,' I saw how difficult it is to make that concept palatable, and how confused it all can be when you don't really know exactly where you're going with it or you don't really know how to access that world properly - that world comic book fans have been accessing for decades and falling in love with.
- Are you stalking me? Because that would be super.
- I come from a family of cops, and all of them share that understanding that they put their lives on the line.
- A producer is someone who actually calls the shots. An executive producer is just a guy that eats more food at craft service.
- I had to wear that suit, so I put in my required time in the gym. But I'm not one of those actors who romanticizes his trials working out and brags that he can bench press a panda now.
- Like a lot of people, I've got a self-loathing streak that's alive and well. It acts as a de facto engine when I'm working, but it also has its extraordinary pitfalls, too.
- I believe in energy like dark energies. I believe that when a family moves into a house where six murders took place, there's going to be some bad juju in that house. But then again what the hell is wrong with you to be moving in that house to begin with?
- When I exhale, I just turn right into Louie Anderson.
- I'm pretty good at surprising friends and family with gifts. I tend to go towards the more sentimental side of giving.
- The stunts on the ground I can do, but I've never been good with heights.
- I know there are actors we all want to beat up a little. I think it's important to do whatever it takes, and whatever it takes sometimes involves some physical or mental discipline. There's a lot at stake.
- I see guys with, like, eyebrow art, and I wanna tell them, 'You don't have to go too crazy on your brows. Take it easy, man!'
- I'm sure I have a lot to atone for, if there is a judgment day. It's gonna be a long list for me. It goes right up until I was about 18, and then I sort of straightened out.
- A well-tailored suit is important - and I don't like wearing belts with mine - it should be tailored to your body.
- I remember that coming to America was scary for me because everything here is just bigger, better, shinier, you know?
- As a kid, I think I wanted to be the on-set dresser for 'Charlie's Angels'. My goals weren't lofty. No. I just wanted to someday quit my paper round and that was about it.
- I just like to look beautiful sometimes.
- It's very tricky to throw a morally flexible character onto the screen and have an audience empathize. It's always an exercise in restraint.
- There's a very real possibility in this industry of going out and leading your life and then going home and being a voyeur of your own life. You can literally go watch yourself - where you went last night, what you did, what the things that people presuppose about you. It's kind of crazy.
- I don't personally believe that villains exist. Villains are just a way of saying that somebody has an opposing conviction.
- I like doing the mainstream, right-down-the-pike broad comedies as much as I like doing the kind of unorthodox different stuff.
- I'll say this: The media wasn't invited to my marriage, and they're definitely not invited into the divorce.
- There's nothing my brothers and I didn't put a hole in. We turned our home into a Wiffle house.
- We might be too proud to admit it as guys, but we still need to learn how to manage responsibility, how to face our challenges.
- We started training a month before the movie started and then by five months in, we were at our peak shape.
- I can't say I've ever finished a film and been particularly thrilled with myself or patted myself on the back. And maybe that's what keeps me going, and that's a good thing. It speaks volumes about how I perceive myself.
- People have their complexities. They have their heroic moments and their villainous moments, too.
- Every time I've gotten myself into trouble, it's because I'm choosing a project based on a long-term career goal as opposed to something that speaks to me at the moment.
- I don't get a lot of romantic comedy scripts.
- Fragrance is a very personal gift, and I think that's why it makes a great Christmas gift. There's a very distinct signature to it, so if you give it as a gift, I like to think that it's from a person that thinks very highly of you.
- A live action movie is work, and an animated movie is you showing up in your pajamas once every three months, or in my case, just a splash of baby powder. It's not any kind of heavy lifting.
- I read the 'Deadpool' series back in the '90s. I'm not, like, a huge comic book reader, per say, though. I'll check out 'Archie' when I'm in the grocery line, but that's about it.
- I think we know too much about actors as it is and their personal lives and it's this information age where we're stimulated constantly by the celebrity buzz effect or whatever it is, these web sites and blogs and different things.
- Even if my father wasn't speaking to me, he would never, ever miss a baseball game.
- I'm not one of those actors who romanticizes his trials working out and brags that he can bench press a panda now.
- I've had an alarming amount of concussions.
- I have a discipline that has served me very well in my career and in my personal life... and that's gotten stronger as I've gotten older. I've always felt if I don't just have a natural knack for it, I will just out-discipline the competition if I have to - work harder than anybody else.
- I'm a bit of an M&M nut. I like the blue ones. I pick them out.
- It's tough. It's very tricky to throw a morally flexible character onto the screen and have an audience empathize. It's always an exercise in restraint.
- I think you have to let go of this idea that you can be precious about everything, and let it be the abstract mess that it is.
- The problem with romantic comedies is you know the ending by the poster. So they're not movies you can keep doing over and over again expect satisfaction somehow.
- He has such a clear vision of exactly what he wanted out of each character, out of each set, out of each wardrobe change, out of each emotional beat, and action.
- I have daddy issues. So I keep tissues on me at all times.
- I love Canada. It makes a nice hat for America. When America runs out of water, it's the first place I'll go.
- My tattoo is of a cannon in Vancouver that I got in a fleeting moment of stupidity maybe 14 years ago. A lot of people have really beautiful tattoos, and I get real tattoo envy. But then other people basically just treat them like bumper stickers for their bodies.
- My family is as far from a stage family as you could ever possibly find.
- Acting has given me a way to channel my angst. I feel like an overweight, pimply faced kid a lot of the time - and finding a way to access that insecurity, and put it toward something creative is incredibly rewarding. I feel very lucky.
- I love doing six versions of any joke, so if they'll give me six takes, I'd love to do it.
- I think we can all use a little more patience. I get a little impatient sometimes and I wish I didn't. I really need to be more patient.
- Four months after we finished shooting, I'd been in New Orleans shooting another movie and my agent and I were having a bite to eat - actually in London - and he's sitting there and goes, 'Wow, I just can't believe how ripped you are.'
- I just love bikes. It's not the safest passion to have, but I guess it's better than Russian roulette.
- When your dad's a cop, calling 911 is really just like calling Dad at work.
- You know, there's nobody where I've said, 'Man, I really want that guy's career.' I mean, each of us has to make our own go of it.
- My father was a police officer before he retired. One of my brothers is also a police officer, and I think they kind of expected I would do something along those lines, like become a fireman or something.
- I'm six foot two. If I need security around me, there's a problem.
- Any great director is also someone who is incredibly intelligent about whom they hire around them.
- I feared disappointing my father more than anything in the world.
- When you have expectations, you are setting yourself up for disappointment.
- I think everybody involved in a movie thinks about the box office. It's the 'biz' part of showbiz.
- It's funny, because there are so many stereotypes out there about actors and movie stars in general, but I've had a great opportunity to meet a lot of them, and maybe it's just because they don't behave that way around me, but I rarely see that kind of abuse of power.
- It's a nice visual. I had just done Blade and I put on more weight for Blade and I thought I might as well use it so I kept it and added a little more. I wanted him to be a big bear.
- I run in a pair of New Balances with a thinner sole, but they're nothing like those barefoot shoes that show all five toes. I have a bit of a phobia about those.
- Making a mix CD - albeit slightly old school - is generally a pretty cool gift and something I like to receive, or giving someone a book that moved you. Writing an inscription inside makes it even better.
- By the time I came to L.A. I'd already cried on movies of the week with two of the women from 'Knots Landing'.
- A nicely fitted two-button suit is the best thing any guy can have. Guys are lucky: We can wear a suit over and over, just with different shirts and ties.
- I firmly believe that you can't manufacture chemistry with anyone, let alone a kid.
- I think a fragrance is more of a signature than even what you wear - something you'll remember more down the road than a shirt.
- There's a lot of actors I think that appear so much more together as the characters they portray as opposed to the actual people, so I know I've said this before: Hollywood's not a place where you're rewarded for growing up.
