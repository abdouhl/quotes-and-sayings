- I work on my own music every day. I'm pretty much always working on it so it's like, after I get out the studio, I just want silence.
- I like to put people in their feelings.
- What am I afraid of as an artist? I guess I was scared before of just not being heard. But I'm too loud now.
- I love the type of music that comes out of Miami, but it's not the artist that I want to be.
- I did 'Oh Holy Night,' which is one that I grew up listening to because I was in choir in high school and we would do Christmas concerts and competitions every year.

- I'm really happy doing normal things.
- Holding The Gun' symbolizes loyalty and an everlasting type of love.
- I do write my own stuff.
- Flowers are just a natural thing in my life. I gravitate towards them so much, just in every video that I do, every visual, for some reason, flowers are incorporated.
- Before moving to L.A., I was working with a lot of people who were manipulating me, where they either wanted to put things out immediately or didn't - I was on everybody else's time frame. But once I was on my own, I was like, 'You know what? I'm going to do this right and take my time, and I'll put things out only when I'm ready.'
- Becoming an artist and finding my way, I did kind of veer off into different genres and none of them ever fit.
- The visual for 'Holding The Gun' is a love story. It's about a ride or die and unapologetic type of love and a kind of loyalty that only comes once in a lifetime.
- I'm usually most inspired when I finish performing and traveling.
- I'm not a fashion person, but I would describe my style as very neutral. I love a good silk slip.

- Going from Miami to L.A., it's such a different scene. In L.A., it's always dressing to impress. Miami is not, unless you go to South Beach.
- I wrote 'Truth Is' with Julia Michaels during our first time working together. The song is about emotions we often think of but are afraid to voice - the feelings we try to convince ourselves we don't actually feel.
- Those two words, 'Truth Is,' symbolize everything this album is about.
- I'm not the happiest when it comes to my music.
- I feel like L.A. is my actual home.
- I started making original music during my YouTube process. And as a young female, dealing with a lot of male producers who were older and had more so-called experience, they would discourage me, telling me that what I was doing - and even my vision - was never going to work. And that lasted quite a long time.
- I'm still learning about myself, my body and my mind, but I'm not afraid to tell my story.
- There's such a theme when it comes to Christmas, and we're so used to hearing that theme over and over in different ways with the classic Christmas songs.
- Rain symbolizes darkness but also represents an essential part of rebirth.
- I'm growing as a woman and I'm able to write about things that I wanted to write about when I was younger.
- Everything that I do, it just has the sultry vibe behind it.
- On 'About Time' there were about three times I had a co-writer with me. The rest of them was me, I wrote them myself.
- No Rain, No Flowers' is an inside look into my journey of healing and growth.

- Everything is tough when you're just starting out in this industry, because there's a lot of shady people out there. So finding the right people is the toughest thing.

- When I first started writing, when I was 15, I would go to work with people and they would tell me my lyrics were too mature for my age!

- When it comes to creation, I am open. However, I am extremely picky when it comes to who I create with.
- By letting go of my fears and concerns, I've gained so much happiness and freedom. With that freedom I've also gained confidence.
- I'm an extremely introverted and isolated writer, but I was starting to feel exhausted and as if my writing was becoming redundant. As much as it was a silly fear of mine, I began opening myself up to other writers and it was the best decision I could've made for my art.
- There's such a stigma against females and them speaking their mind and them being confident and stubborn that it's almost like it becomes a fear that we don't want anybody to think of us in a specific way.
- I'm Cuban and Puerto Rican and Miami is very Cuban oriented. Growing up around the music - all of the salsa and meringue influenced me as an artist. I find myself gravitating to latin influences, sounds.
