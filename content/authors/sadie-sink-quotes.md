- In 'White Christmas,' I wasn't the main part.
- I've definitely grown up, but I'm the same Sadie now that I would have been, even if I wasn't on 'Stranger Things.'
- I'm not just edgy, and I'm not just into a tomboy look, and I'm not just girly. I do what I want, and if I like something, I'll wear it.
- My Miu Miu gown at the Golden Globes was the first time I had anything custom-made for me.
- I've been compared to a lot of redheads. Here's the thing though: you can look nothing like somebody, but if you both have red hair, all of a sudden people think you look exactly the same.

- I'm a huge 'Back to the Future' fan.

- I'm not really about spending every second on social media. I think there's a lot more useful things you can do with your time.

- In musicals, everyone is screaming.
- I think there's this misconception about vegans, that it's impossible, and they're crazy or whatever. But it's not like that. You can be vegan and still be really chill.
- I'm usually the kind of person where if someone tells me, 'Oh my God, you have to watch this show. It's amazing,' I kind of want to go against it and not watch it. But for 'Stranger Things,' I couldn't resist. I had to watch it.
- I'm open to trying multiple different types of styles.
- I think, often, child actors are, like, overlooked a little bit.
- I don't always enjoy them, but when a scary movie has a really good storyline, that gets me interested.

- I go through so many different phases, just like every teenage girl does.
- I have not seen 'It' because I don't like horror movies. I don't mess with clowns or demons.
- I have, like, a playlist with all my favourite songs on it. Sadie's Playlist is the soundtrack of my life. 'Wonderwall' by Oasis, 'Under The Bridge' by Red Hot Chili Peppers, TLC, 'Waterfalls' - I love the '90s.
- College is right for some people, and it's not for others. I shouldn't rush into it just because that's what everyone does after high school is you go to college.
- Chicken and waffles! I'm obsessed with those.
- It's become easier to speak up for myself.

- If you're a child, and you're on Broadway, you automatically know every other child in a production.
- I've always loved fashion, but I think that right now, it's hit its peak - I'm just so obsessed with clothes and paying attention to brands and collections. I guess 16 is kind of the age when you start to develop opinions on all that and knowing what suits your style.
- I've always been laid back, go with the flow.
- Now it's like, I'll go to Starbucks, or I'll go to the mall or anywhere, and lots of people will recognize me, and I'm like, 'Oh, wow, this is actually a thing now; this is happening.' It can get a little bit crazy at times, but I love meeting people, and people shouldn't feel scared to come up to me and say 'Hi.'

- Before, I would just only stick to a few certain colors that were considered good for my skin tone and good for my hair.

- There was one time during my busiest month when I went into school, and they were like, 'Sadie, where's your calculator? The PSAT is today.' I was like, 'The what?' Luckily, it was the practice one, but I still had to text my dad and get him to bring me my graphing calculator.
- It's so easy to be insecure about your looks or if you're wearing the right clothes, or your hair and makeup. And I think it's just so important to stay true to who you are.
- My friend had told me about 'Stranger Things' and how I had to watch it. I was like, 'OK, I will!' I binged it in, like, a day and was like, 'Oh my gosh, Mom, you need to watch this show. Everyone needs to watch this.' A week later, I got the breakdown for Max. A month later, I got the part.

- I would write scripts and little plays and perform them in the living room for my family when I was little with my brother until my mom said, 'Alright, you need to go do it somewhere else other than the house.'
- I want to go to college, definitely. If it's possible, I want to.
- I'm passionate about encouraging girls to be confident in their own skin.

- I'd always just look at Chanel and Kate Spade and think how incredible these brands were.
- I knew the big following 'Stranger Things' had, and I really liked the show, but even if I hadn't known what the show was, I still really related to the character, and I really liked the material.
- My dad's a teacher and a football coach, and he found a job in New Jersey.
