- Being sick is a different story than having an injury. If you have a right arm injury, you can still use the rest of your body. You still have the energy to perform.

- At 155, I kind of feel, when I'm fighting out there, I just don't feel like I have the right thinking ability. I kind of feel like my mind is foggy, if that makes sense. I don't really know how to describe it. Maybe it's the weight cut.

- Having full-time classes, it doesn't really work out because there's so much workload and so much studying that you really don't have time to train.

- Being in school and doing the fighting stuff, it is very tough. I had school work all the way from Monday through Friday, and then on the weekends, you had homework, engineering projects and stuff. That makes it very tough.
- I've always thought about welterweight.
- I believe the UFC knows what they're watching and looking for, so I always try and put on a great show for everybody watching and try to go out there and finish my opponent and do something exciting. I believe a lot of people come out to watch me and see me perform.
- I consider my MMA training starting the day I set foot in Urijah Faber's gym.
- It can be kind of difficult because of the workload I have at Texas A&M, so I have to find time to study as I pursue my major, but also to travel and compete and train hard for my fights to come in the UFC.
- I have my coach, Urijah Faber. He's watching me do everything pretty much all the time. I'm training or grappling or sparring live. He's over there making adjustments. He's really hands on, so that makes a big difference.

- I feel the power in words that you can turn into reality.
- I just want to say real quick, whatever kind of problems you've been going through, maybe you're having a hard time at work, maybe you're having a hard time with your family, whatever it might be, you can overcome that. You just have to keep your hope up.
- I believe coming in early to the UFC gives me an advantage. More time to learn, more time to be in the UFC and get better as a fighter.
- I might take a little time off from school to train. I'd be a totally different animal if I trained full time.
- Typically, when someone gets a choke on me, I have a pretty strong neck. It's usually hard to choke me.
- Georges St-Pierre - he's so awesome. It was very great getting to roll around with him and getting to train with him. He's so nice and so friendly, and he's very humble, too.
- I'm taking it one fight at a time. But I always see myself being victorious.
- I never really have a game plan other than to finish my opponent as quickly as possible.
- A lot of the times, anything that somebody tries to say negative is actually kind of funny.

- I love being young and looking forward to seeing what I can do.

- Words are powerful.
- The UFC offered me a fight against one of the Top-10 fighters named Demian Maia. I believe he was, like, No. 2 at the time. They obviously believed in me to think that I could face one of the best guys in the division.
- I started working out and doing martial arts when I was about 4 years old, and I was competing by the time I was five or six. So my mom and dad had me doing push-ups and sit-ups from a very young age.
- What everybody has seen from me is very little compared to what I'm capable of doing.
- I always stay positive if I can. I always stay upbeat and always have a ton of energy.
- A lot of people have a lot of things going on in their life. You'll be walking past ten people in the middle of the day and not even notice, but someone might have a family member that died, or someone might be going through a hard time. Sometimes you're the only person that someone might see that lifts them up.
- At the point in a match where most guys would wear out, I'll still be fresh.
- Personally, I think I might end up fighting heavyweight in the future. I can just see myself keep growing. I'll be 24, 25, growing 2, 3, 4 more inches, and putting on a lot of muscle. I can absolutely see it.
