- For background, Brand New Congress was created in the summer of 2016 with the goal of recruiting 400 candidates to run for Congress with a national campaign and a clear set of policies they would advocate for. It was an attempt to create, as per the name, a brand new Congress.
- I am talking about the radical conservatives in the Democratic Party. That's who we need to counter. It's the same across any number of issues - pay-as-you-go, free college, 'Medicare for all.' These are all enormously popular in the party, but they don't pass because of the radical conservatives who are holding the party hostage.
- Similar to how 'Abolish ICE' rang the bell on this huge crisis on immigration, unifying around not taking corporate-PAC money gets everybody to pay attention to big money in politics.
- I think people more and more are tired of the party system. People want good candidates and good people to win.
- Running on corporate-PAC money is a huge liability.

- Yes, climate change is an existential threat, but there's also kind of this existential issue of why is it that as our society is progressing... things seem to be regressing and getting worse for a large number of people? Why is that happening? How do we fix that?
- The reality is, our problem isn't that more people are voting Republican than Democrat - our problem is most people who would vote Democrat aren't voting.

- There's a whole pipeline for where people recruit current Hill staff from, and it's people who go through a kind of ideological training that's incorrect, I'd say, and so there's a lot of work to do, and Justice Democrats is trying to figure out where it fits.
- I'm not a fan of people making up lies, and I do feel I owe it to people to know what the truth is.

- It's fairly common for new members of Congress to hire their former campaign managers onto their official staff.

- It's not at all a secret that I was one of the co-founders of Brand New Congress, and we've never tried to hide our goals.

- What the Bernie campaign showed us was that you could out-raise a well-funded opponent with grassroots donations, and you could out-voter-contact them, too.
- We need new leaders, period.
