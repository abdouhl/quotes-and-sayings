- I grew up in a church. My mom is a minister so she would make us go to every possible church she could muster.
- My mom made me read a ton of books, so I got good at words and understood the English language. So when I started rapping, words were something I knew. I learned how to manipulate them so that I could say whatever I wanted to say.
- I use Cetaphil face wash. It's really simple. Nothing super fancy. I just feel like it needs to clean your face and not add or take away from anything.
- People use the word success often, I don't use that word.
- I don't know how to be comfortable. Comfort is uncomfortable to me so I push myself to new places.
- There's no better feeling than when I go outside and I see the faces of people who paid their money just to see me, that tells me the music is going where it's supposed to and that's encouraging.
- There's no real music scene in Guyana, but there's a music space. So there's no scene because there's no economy for it, but there's a space because everything that spills over dancehall and reggae, spills over.
- I didn't want to tell my story through my words in someone else's voice.
- I'm a Brooklyn kid. So for me, rap and all the other forms of music that I participate in, we catch a win? It's a win for everybody.
- I can't play guitar or piano. I can't even play dumb to get through TSA in the airport.
- I say I design music. I can imagine it and sort of picture it. I think about all of the things I do in the world and say that I'm designing it because it takes the same skill set.
- I think it takes an unbelievable amount of hours for anybody to master their craft.
- I think it's challenging trying to describe my sound. Not because I'm making some experimental martian music, but because it's a little broader. The things that you've heard are only fragments and small fractions of what you're going to hear.
- Every dollar I spend, I'm looking to fall in love. I have a few things I already love, but I'm always thinking that I can do better. I'm always on the hunt.
- I don't think of myself as just a rapper. But overspending on sneakers? That's a real rapper thing to do.
- I don't want to give you the opportunity to find a box to put me in, figure it out later. When the records come out song by song, you'll hear it and get to determine how you want to classify me.
- I like musk and oud in a really, really delicate way. Because sometimes, if there's too much oud, it just smells like you're in the back of a cab in Harlem and I can't do it.
- I just wanted people to hear the sounds and fall in love and not overthink it. You get a 12-year-old and you'll get a 55-year-old standing next to each other in the audience. They're from different eras of music but they'll feel the same way.
- I was rapping because there were so many things that I wanted to say. There weren't enough words for me to articulate all of the things that I wanted to say in a three minute song.
- I make these songs for me. That's the truth. I make them because that's what I want to hear. Long before you ever hear it, believe that I'm in a Porsche with the top off listening to it.
- The 4-year-old me was getting laughed in school at for being too dark.
- The only thing I know is the only things that I know. You can't ask me to talk about something I have no information on. I stay silent. It'd be foolish. So when I talk about something, it's something I at least have a little bit of familiarity with me.
- I had a good start. I did a record with Beyonce. I did a record with Lenny Kravitz. I put out my second collection of music and then my second collection of clothes.
- I was never afraid to try female products. I didn't believe in those gender identities as it related to products.
- If I say I'm rich enough times and enough people say it back to me, I gotta be rich, right?
- I'm not a center-of-attention guy.
- The first time I worked with Usher, I learned that I belonged in the room. You know the first time you get invited into a room you have never been in and you almost feel like you lied your way in? The second time, you don't feel like you lied your way in.
- So when I was a kid in Guyana, I would run barefoot in the street and bathe in the rain. That was a real thing. Picture that, showers falling from the sky in the middle of the Caribbean.

- I make music in terms of collections.
