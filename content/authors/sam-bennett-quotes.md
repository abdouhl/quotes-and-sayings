- Third Irishman to wear the green jersey, after 31 years, that's very special for me, and I'm focused on keeping it.
- I know I am a good rider, but sometimes I don't see myself as a big rider.
- What I've found in the last few tours is that it takes a week to hit the body. You're still on a high and your body gets into a rhythm. So, you almost have to de-train off it and keep riding the bike for a few days before you take a while off.
- Whenever I'm sick or injured, I go into a bubble and shut myself off.
- Early in the season, you're going into races feeling confident because you've done the work and that confidence gives you an extra five or 10 per cent.
- I'd have moments when I'd show potential, but I could never get a good period where I'd string some form together and get results. It was up and down the whole time and I was getting frustrated.
- It is funny, I have the ability to win a stage in the Tour de France and I do win races that are the same category, WorldTour.
- In the cycling world I am... okay, it sounds arrogant, but I am pretty high up. And I am a good athlete. But it is not recognised in Ireland.
- I started racing when I was 14 and remember guys like Denis Dunne and Martin Hanrahan dropping me by 10 minutes.
- I always say my three dream wins would be San Remo, Champs-Elysees, and World Championships.
- I think you just have to accept there is pressure, that's part of the moment. I suppose when you have that pressure it means that it really means something to you, so you just have to embrace it.
- Paris in green or a stage win, tough one. I never really thought about the green until I was wearing it. It's something special to wear.
- You could go out on a Sunday spin in Carrick-on-Suir, and it's a small town, but you could have 80 riders. That wouldn't even be everyone, in the group. It's just such a good environment to bring guys through, the support and the experience.
- Riding for QuickStep was a dream of mine from an early age. I couldn't let this opportunity go.
- The Champs-Elysees is like the world championships for sprinters.
- The green jersey is more about being consistently up, every day, and three parts really.
- Carrick has a big cycling culture and I would compare it to the Isle of Man in the UK.
- I know when the racing starts everything will calm down and the legs will be there. It's in the days before you have to keep your mind occupied.
