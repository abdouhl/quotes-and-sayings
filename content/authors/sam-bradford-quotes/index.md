- I do realize that God has given me so many blessings in my life. I mean, not only with football, but with the family that He's blessed me with and the opportunity He's given me to grow up in a home that embraces God.
- I need to put the right things in my body before and after I work out, so I end every workout with some sort of protein shake to help me get the most out of my training.
- Music really gets me going, so I've always got to make sure I have my iPod to give me energy to work out.
- I really did love hockey. It was one of my favorite things to do.
- For a long time, I thought I was going to play basketball. There's not many 6-4 white guys playing the three spot in the NBA, so I realized I probably didn't have much of a future in basketball and that football was probably going to be my best bet.
- I really don't see a reason why you wouldn't want to have a relationship with Jesus Christ. I mean, not only was He the greatest human being to ever walk the earth, He's everything that I want to strive for. He's everything that anyone should ever want to strive for.
- I played a million different sports when I was growing up. I started when I was probably five or six, and we'd just go from activity to activity to activity. I think, finally, my parents just realized that we were missing something in our lives. They realized that it was time for us as a family to start going to church.
- I can't control what's going to happen in the future. I can't control what's going to happen in five hours. So I'm not really worried about it. I'm just focused on doing what I can at this moment.
- I'm a big routine guy. I have to have everything in threes.
- The products in my bathroom are pretty minimal. Issey Miyake makes great cologne, and I use everything from Zirh, especially their shave scream. I really like Mario Badesco aftershave, too. It's amazing.
- You want to play for a guy who's going to be there for you. He's going to lead you. He's going to inspire you. Someone that the guys in the locker room can really rally around.
- I need to have proper equipment when I work out, and the Nike Frees are light, comfortable, and great for training. I also usually bring a short-sleeve or long-sleeve compression shirt and a pair of shorts.
- On game day, if I eat fruit - I usually eat fruit in the mornings - I have to have three pieces of cantaloupe, three pieces of pineapple. Everything's in threes.
- My favorite was always whichever sport was in season. I think these days it's almost saddening to see kids who are 10 or 11 and are forced to choose one sport and specialize in that sport and play that sport year-round. By playing different sports... you become a better all-around athlete.
- I feel like regardless of whether or not I win this award or I win that award or I don't win this award - I'm still Sam at the end of the day. And that's what defines me.
