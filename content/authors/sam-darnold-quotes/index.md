- To be the No. 1 pick, that would be so special.

- For me, and I said this even before the draft, I think being with the same team for my whole career would be something that would be very special to me because, especially at the quarterback position, that means that we won a lot of games, hopefully Super Bowls, 'cause that's the end goal.
