- I'm hopelessly addicted to Instagram.
- I messed around with the guitar from the age of about eight, but when I hit 13, it was the only thing I wanted from life.
- I think the best writing is full of honesty and conviction. A lot of people are afraid to reveal much of themselves.
- The reality is, the only thing I can control is whether my songs are good and if I can turn up and sing. All the rest is background noise.
- A lot of my songs are just posing questions, because I'm on a journey to find the answers myself.
- I wanted to change my name when I first started because I thought, 'No-one is going to believe that it is my name.'

- I recorded 'Play God' in a shed. I don't know how we got it to sound as good as it did.

- 'Poundshop Kardashians' is Newcastle on a Saturday night. Nobody wears coats - it's all muscles and V-necks and fake tan.
- I love my job - I'm going to keep doing it until I die - but there's nothing more soul-destroying than having to cancel a show.

- I was told not to cry as a kid.
- I've chronicled a time when I was 17, 18, utterly terrified that you're not gonna get anywhere with whatever you want to do. It's that fear and claustrophobia that I think comes to most people living in small towns. But I am lucky, because I just knew that music was my thing.
- I'm a horrendous cook; my mum does my meals. I can only cook beans on toast with cheese.

- I've been lucky enough to support some absolute legends and incredible songwriters over the years, including Hozier, Daughter, Willy Mason, Catfish and the Bottlemen, Nick Mulvey, and Benjamin Francis Leftwich.
- I think honesty is an important thing when writing a song. If you can't sing it with conviction, then no-one else is going to believe it.
- Musicians - we're not doctors. We're not saving people's lives. We're not going out and changing the world. We're not coming up with cancer cures. We're not any of that. They're the real heroes of the world.
- The thing about Springsteen, his music, although he's writing about, you know, New Jersey and Asbury Park, all of them places, it's blue-collar towns that, like - it's similar to Newcastle, where I'm from.
- I put enough pressure on myself already - I can sit here and work myself into an anxiety-filled breakdown without worrying what everyone else is going to think.

- I'm not an expert on politics, but there's a bunch of bad people at the top who care about lining their own pockets before creating a society that looks after the vulnerable.
- When you have these moments where a song connects with people and creates a conversation, it's quite a humbling experience because it's like, 'Maybe there is a little bit more weight to this job than I thought there ever was before.' Which was wonderful that that happened with 'Dead Boys.'
- The Cure wrote 'Boys Don't Cry,' and it's the same today: as a boy, you're not meant to show your emotions, but if you don't have a job or any prospects, you're going to be depressed, and it will be much worse if you can't express that. I hate the term because it's become a buzzword, but it's toxic masculinity.

- I'm relentless when it comes to writing and recording.
- Even when a Geordie is trying to be nasty, it doesn't sound that threatening.
- My favourite writers are always great storytellers, like Bruce Springsteen; I adore Bruce Springsteen. I feel like he doesn't beat around the bush, and he doesn't overcomplicate things. He puts things into layman's terms and tells stories that anyone can understand.

- Back in the day, you could have a crap gig, and nobody would film you. Now, everybody's got an iPhone - you have a bad day, and it's going on the Internet.
- I'm so grateful to everyone back home for believing, and to my band and team for all their hard work.
- My mam and dad were blasting Steely Dan when I was born; the music hasn't stopped since then.
- It's so surreal for us to be playing at Tynemouth Castle. It couldn't be much closer to home. I've got so many mad stories of us all running around here as kids, and it's mental that we're going to be playing at an actual castle!
- Music was always ever present when I was growing up, and it's continued to be the most important and intrinsic part of me. It kept me from going off the rails as a kid, and it gave me rare purpose and self-confidence that I couldn't find from anything else.
- Me and my mates are very, very close. We all talk about our problems - especially as we've got older. But I don't think a lot of people have that.
- I'm asking questions that most people are asking, but just putting a melody or a song to it.

- I love my hometown, but 'Leave Fast' is the way I felt when I was 17, 18 - it's that fear that I'd never be able to do something else.

- I write all my own songs, so if it goes wrong, I don't co-write anything. It's all going to fall on me.
- Men just need to be open and not emasculate one another.
- The music industry as a whole needs to genuinely make a conscious effort to look after people's physical and mental health.
- It's impossible to let fame go to your head when you still live in North Shields in a flat with your mum.
- I think I got stopped on the train once by a kid, and that was the first time I realised I had fans. He was shaking. I just reassured him that I'm an idiot and nothing special, so he didn't have to be nervous. It was very sweet.
- I was probably the only kid in school that had long hair.
- I think I'm the last generation that remembers life before the smartphone. I'm going to be one of them old geezers going, 'You know, when I was a kid, we used to play with sticks.'
