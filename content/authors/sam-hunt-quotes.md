- I have a whole, whole lot of respect for the men and women that serve our country.
- I am kind of the front man for a team of people behind the scenes who are working just as hard as me and are putting in just as much time to make this all happen. I'm not trying to be humble. I just want everyone to get credit where credit is due.
- The first song I learned on the guitar was a Kenny Chesney song called 'What I Need to Do'; it was just an easy song to play... and it was really cool to see that come full-circle a few years later and have him record a song that I was part of.
- I'm not really a piano player, but I play enough to get away with it.
- 'Make You Miss Me' is an important song to me. Having it go No. 1 as the fifth single off of my first record is the cherry on top of a chapter in my life I'll never forget.
- People throw things at me sometimes, at big festivals.
- I had some interesting costumes... the one that I remember right offhand is Zorro when I was a lot younger. I was a big time Zorro fan. My mom helped me make it, and I remember having a big issue with the fact that she wouldn't let me carry around a real metal sword; it just had to be plastic.
- I was a product of the relationships with my family, the environment I grew up in; all those things I kind of put on the back burner when I got into music, and my life all changed dramatically.
- I was pretty gung-ho about music and pursuing that and figuring that whole thing out, so I was wide-eyed and ready to go when I moved to Nashville. I never looked back.
- By no means do I want to try to leave country music. That's absolutely where I want to stay.
- I kept hearing all these rules: 'You can't say that in country music.' 'You can't use that kind of beat.' I became so frustrated. It may have slingshotted me, in a rebellious way, toward doing something different.
- I connect music to the emotions that come from relationships, so most of the songs that I write are inspired by those circumstances, emotions, feelings, all that kind of stuff.
- I don't know where my fashion sense comes from, exactly. I've always been interested in, not necessarily being unique, but not necessarily sticking to the preexisting paradigm - whether it be clothes or music or whatever.

- We try not to pull any punches and be straightforward, and I think that's what helped us connect with everybody across the board.
- I really feel like I honed in on a sound and a style of writing that best fits me.
- There's such a strong community element in country - it's like a family. So I don't want to do anything that can come off, even if I'm not intentionally doing it, as giving the perception that I'm trying to abandon that family.
- I got a horse when I was eight or 10 years old. And dad used to take me to the rodeo back home. I got into it big time.

- I love all kinds of music, and I would write really traditional country songs and songs that were just really out there, that didn't sound country at all, and everything in between.
- I like doing stuff like, for instance, in the 'Leave the Night On' video, I had on a plain white T-shirt. I just wanted to do something to it to make it a little different, so I just cut a big strip out of the side, from the shirttail up to my armpit, and cut a big red strip out of another T-shirt and just sewed it in there.
- I wanted to be a bull rider when I grew up.

- I get the best inspiration or the most creativity from real emotions.
- I love what Drake does, but I don't want to be called the Drake of country.
- The most flattering thing I hear is, 'I didn't think I liked country music before I heard your record.'
- Football sometimes is stressful. Music is more of a kind of laid-back type, chilled-out kind of activity. It kind of keeps me balanced, I guess.
- I have a cat named Dandelion.
- When I graduated high school, I bought a guitar and, at first, didn't really think I'd get into the songwriting thing as much as I did. But after learning a few songs of other people's to play on the guitar, I got bored with that and just started writing songs on my own, and that's kinda how it came about.
- A lot of times, songs can blend together on the radio because there's so many great songs out there.

- Putting out music as it's made, versus holding it until an album's finished, allows me to be more timely and maintain balance.

- I've tried to work really hard on never phoning in the lyrics.
- I've always really liked the rhythm element of songs.
- I'm conflicted about the lyric tattoo thing. I feel like that's a lifetime decision, and I always feel like, 'I hope you don't regret this a couple years from now when you get tired of that song.'

- It took me a couple years to get over the stereotype I was letting myself get caught up on, being a football player trying to start a career in music.
- I do think I'm country, but your definition of that word might be different from my definition. In my opinion, country music, the sound of country, has always evolved. But the one thing that has not changed is the story element. And I think country songs are truthful songs about life written by country people.
- Picking up a guitar brought a lot of balance into my life.
- I wrote a song several years ago while I was in college called 'Muscadine Wine.' I really didn't know if it had potential or not, if it was good or bad or what. I played it for my roommates - who I played ball with - one night, and I knew they would tell me the truth. They loved it, and that encouraged me.
- I didn't know what to expect, having not been an artist before. From the outside, you only see romantic snapshots of what seems like a great lifestyle, and it is, but it's also grueling.
- I'm still learning a lot as a songwriter. I try to write down and make a note of ideas that I cross paths with on a day-to-day basis, whether it be a conversation or something I hear on the radio, seeing a movie, or just thoughts in my head as I'm walking down the street.
- I've always wanted to do my best to make sure it's clear that I want to keep the focus on my music.
- I didn't really know you could make a living in songwriting. I was just very fortunate to have the opportunity to play a few songs for a guy there named Jimmy Ritchey. Through that meeting, I met another couple guys and ended up getting a publishing deal in Nashville.
- I don't like the idea that in music, clothes, taste or anything, we are limited to a certain style, because we need to maintain an identity, maybe between some subculture group. Hopefully, all those walls break down, and music is just music.
- A lot of the lessons that are taught in football will promote success in anything you get into after football; for me, it just happens to be music. Being disciplined. Good character. Trying to do the right thing, and working hard.
- You want to stand out and be unique and do something different. I always try to zig when they zag - I guess it's a football term, but it applies to a lot of different areas of life.
- I thought that I could have a career in music. I really didn't know exactly what I wanted to do or how I would go about doing it.
- Any chance to get out and play live for some people and get out of the studio is nice.
- When I was really young, my babysitters had horses, and I started riding them.
- The money factor had been kind of my excuse as to why I hadn't put out any music. So I just found the cheapest way to make music and get it to people, and that was via the Internet.
- I've had a lot of folks tell me that my songs weren't quite country because they didn't really sound like anybody that had come along and done it before me. I felt a little out of place for a while.
- I realized after writing songs for years how important it is. Whether it provides a living for me or not, that creative outlet is something I need.
- I'm not in control of my fate, and that's a good thing.
- I was able to really see that connection as a football player where success requires a lot of hard work and effort, physically and mentally.
- There's a system in place in Nashville, and for a long time, I was trapped in this idea that the only way to do it was to come to town, get a record deal, and do it the way they say. And that system works. But it caters to a specific kind of artist, and I didn't necessarily fit that mold.
- I'm going to put music out when I feel like it's ready.
- I drove right into the music with the same sort of attitude as I went into the football stuff with. Just found a routine and hard work, and it helped me progress a lot faster.
- I do feel pressure internally and externally to put out music, but that excites me because I love songwriting, and this brings me back to why I got in music in the first place, so I'm excited about that.
- My route is a little bit nontraditional. A lot of the people working in Nashville, they have a model. I don't really fit into that.
- With a song called 'House Party,' you'd expect it to be more about a big party, not as much about a relationship, so we tried to put a little bit of a unique twist on it.
- In a small town, it's either sports or a band with your buddies. I was always athletic. But in college, I was exposed to all this new music, and I was drawn to hip-hop and R&B.
- I don't let many things that are superficial keep me in a box.
- As much as I enjoy traveling and playing on stage as an artist, I really find my true sense of purpose in a room writing a song.
- I was really only around country music on the radio, and I think because I grew up so close to Atlanta, and R&B was such a big part of that culture, by proximity I think a lot of that music influenced me without knowing it.
- It's liberating to wear clothes that are outside the boundaries of what I'm supposed to wear, ya know, based on the traditional model, whether that be a country music singer, or being from the country. It's not a rebellious thing.
- It's good to be proud of your heritage and your culture, but pride can be perverted.
- It's just really fulfilling to celebrate with a group of folks, a team, than it is personally.
- It wasn't in the cards to work out in football.
- Maybe one day music will just be music, and there won't be these categories; it'll just be different shades of music.
- I definitely grew up as a small-town... I guess you could call it the 'small-town football player,' according to the stereotype. I wasn't involved in music at all.
- My style, in terms of what I wear, is kind of representative of the music.
- I played quarterback, and it was a leadership position, and even though I'm doing a solo thing now, a lot of my success is a part of assembling this team of people who are really, really talented, and their position doesn't put them out front the way mine does, but it's still a team effort.
- From the pop side, people like Usher, and when they first came out, I listened to guys like K-Ci and JoJo; that '90s R&B thing really caught my ear.
- I wasn't intentionally trying to be different, but that was an element of what I naturally do that happened to be unique enough to spark a curiosity for people.
- There's this sort of model that exists in Nashville that we think we have to abide by: You put out a record, and in two years you have to put out another one and have three or four singles. There are all these rules that I've just sort of thrown out the window.
- It wasn't until I was 18, when I was graduating high school, that I went and bought a guitar on a whim.

- Respect for women was a very important part of my upbringing.
- People sniff out when you try to fake something or be something you are not.
- Obviously, I love country music, so I wanna be able to live in the country music genre and then play to country music fans.
- I study what's happening in music. I want to sound different than everybody else.
- I could probably recite just about every song that was on country radio between 1990 and 2000.
- When somebody's never heard you, that's the way to do it: Just give them music for free and let them decide for themselves if they like it or not.
- I love so many styles of music.
- The key to me is being different not for the sake of being different, but being the most authentic version of what you do. And definitely it takes a willingness to be different, because there was resistance for me early on, and I feel like that's usually the case when there's a certain paradigm or trend happening, and you step outside of that.
- The things that are going to be in all my records, for as long as I'm making them, are going to go back to who I am and where I'm from and the lifestyle that I live and come from - and I don't know how I could ever get any of that close enough to pop to be considered a pop act.
- At heart, I'm a relationship guy, but my adventurous side makes it hard. I hope I'll find a balance.
- There's not a day goes by that I don't appreciate the freedom that I have to make music and tour and spend time with my family.
- I like to come up with lots of different sounds. So the final version of a song might have been 10 completely different songs before we finally got it right.
- Prior to getting into music, I interacted with, on a daily basis, about 5-10 percent of the people that I've interacted with since then. I've been meeting people from different backgrounds and different cultures. That did allow for a lot of change. I've changed as a product of that, but it's been positive.
- I don't know that I've ever bought anything online. I'm about 10 years behind the technological curve, I think.
- I learned from making a few of these low-budget videos early on that the best way to go about doing it is just to keep it honest and real.
- Shane McAnally is a really good friend of mine. He's one of the first guys that really embraced what I was doing with an open mind.
- I have two or three guys that I'm really close to. We have a great friendship, and I think that helps our songwriting relationship. It's hard to start... with new people and cover the ground that I've covered with those guys.
- I think of a song in terms of lyrics and stories, and that's what keeps it country for me.
- On my teams, as a guy who grew up hunting and fishing, I was in the minority in terms of music and lifestyle. I became good friends with people who listened to R&B and rap. But it wasn't just an issue of being around it - I was naturally drawn to it right off the bat.
- I try to stay as naive as possible so I'm not as aware as much of the risks.
- You think about the artists I look at as icons, and you assume they were instantly embraced. That's usually not the case. In reality, they had to overcome a lot of noes to get where they wanted to be.
- I kind of have my little OCD wood shed at my house where everything is just right when I go write.
- I wish I could make multiple records, stylistically. The way that I'm gonna remedy that is to make a diverse record with a lot of different styles on one record.
- Some people don't like long bus rides, but I love them. There's sort of a sense of solitude.
- I experimented and explored ways to find my own niche in Nashville, and I was having trouble with it for a while because stylistically, I didn't feel like I necessarily fit in.
