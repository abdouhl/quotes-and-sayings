- Just go in and do your work and be ready for it, because when the stars align and the part is available and everybody in the room is excited... and you deliver, that's it.
- I did around 100 episodes as Ted without the band, but the 20 I did with The Blanks are the only ones anyone ever seems to remember.
- I know I always look like the evil one bossing the band around in 'Scrubs' - well, I'm the same in real life too.
- 'Desperate Housewives' worked out beautifully. I went out for that before it began airing, and no one had any idea it was going to turn into what it did.
- I was open to anything, but comedy was what I really loved.
- Very often, when people see me on the streets they would tell me it was great to see me looking so healthy.
- Robert Pastorelli was about the coolest guy I had ever met in my life.
- I thought I had played Ted for the last time when he left Sacred Heart Hospital to be with the love of his life. But the producers of 'Cougar Town' had other ideas.
- There's a picture of me at 3 years old playing the baby rat in 'The Pied Piper.'
- I try to think of myself as both comedic and dramatic.
- We called ourselves The Blanks because when we say who we are, everyone stares at us with a blank expression. But when we then say 'Ted's band from 'Scrubs' everyone goes, 'Oh yeah, you guys.'
- Hopefully after a year or two of touring around eventually we'll just be The Blanks. We do pretty much everything we do on 'Scrubs' in our show, but it's not presented as Ted's Band.
- I was kind of lucky that I had done so much theater over the years, because basically a sitcom is kind of like a hybrid between a film and a play.
- The Blanks has just been a godsend because I don't have to sit around waiting for the phone to ring and I get to go out and be gainfully employed while I'm waiting for another job.
- In fact, my uncle did his first full play at the Westin Playhouse because my dad put in a good word for him to the producer.
- The main difference is that Courtney Cox, in my opinion, is a little cuter than Zach Braff.
- I was exposed to acting at a young age. I was very lucky to grow up in that environment.
- But even if you're not a 'Scrubs' follower you'll still have a good time, because all the songs are recognizable and presented in a way that's unique to The Blanks. We had heard that in some countries a cappella is considered torture, so we wanted to make a show that we'd really want to see as well - so it's music but it's also a lot of comedy.
- I'd been playing Ted in the show for about a year as well as playing in the group in my spare time. Then, at the 'Scrubs' Christmas party, I offered to bring along the band to sing a song. The producers thought we were terrible - but perfect for the show.
- We once played Strathclyde University's student union where they had a crash barrier in front of the stage. I thought that was a little over the top until the gig started and there was this crush at the front. They were even throwing beer bottles - it was wild. You'd have thought we were a rock group instead of a barbershop quartet.
- They have barricades at our gigs - to keep people in. We do most of the songs from 'Scrubs' over 55 minutes.
- You know, it's strange when you're a guest star, because everybody knows each other so well, and they're relaxed, and they have a routine. So you kind of feel like you've just been brought up to the majors for one game, and you're batting ninth.
- Of course, after like, three or four years of being called a loser and putting on bad suits and having the sweat and all that stuff put on me, it does start to get to you after a while.
