- Yes, I did move to New York when I was eighteen to do sports broadcasting. I didn't know how I was going to do it, so I got a job at ESPN Zone, thinking I would meet people in the business.

- I got into sports broadcasting because I loved sports, not because I loved TV.
- I got some big breaks early on, and the attitude around it was always 'You're just lucky to be here.' No one came out and said that, but that was the clear message. And I felt that way.

- I had friends from Somalia and Eritrea and all these different counties, and I was getting to learn about people that I would have never known anything about.

- It's scary to criticize Beyonce in this country. People take their Beyonce very seriously.
- Whenever someone says something to me like 'Oh, another blonde at ESPN,' I would like to crunch the numbers. First, I think we have more brunettes than blondes. And second, there are only three normal hair colors. You're either a redhead, brunette, or blonde. It's really not that complicated.

- Growing up in a sports household where my dad was a coach, I never had to fake my knowledge.
- We are not cool at all. We are probably the most lame couple ever.
- The sexist comments are simply the low hanging fruit for any critic of a woman on TV. 'I don't know what to do with my dislike for this woman so let me just tell her to get in the kitchen.' Well I love the kitchen, that's where all the food is.

- I've been asked a lot about filling Chris Berman's role - to be honest, I don't even allow myself to see it that way. He is a total legend and created so much of what ESPN is known for and specifically our NFL coverage. That's an impossible task.

- There is such a stigma on both sides of being a working mother, and you can fall into the trap of what you think everyone else thinks you should be doing instead of what your instincts and standards say you should do.
- The funny thing that still cracks me up is when you get a grown man coming up to you shaking asking for a picture. I'm like 'Dude, you know I'm a scrub, right?'
