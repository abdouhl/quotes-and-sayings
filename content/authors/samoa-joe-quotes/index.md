- Seeing myself as a champion in WWE is something I've seen from the first day I stepped into the Universe and the realm of the company.
- My relationship with Shinsuke - I mean, he's a tremendous guy, we've maintained our friendship for well over a decade, and he's one of those incredible, rare, once-in-a-lifetime athletes whose ability transcends international border, which is something that's not often able to be done.
- WWE is very good at doing things that are advantageous. If you have the ability to go out there and get on a mic and be captivating, then they're going to do everything in their power to support that ability and make it even bigger and seem better.
- Anytime you're sitting there writing a book about yourself, it's a pretty self-fulfilling prophecy, I guess.
- I've been at the table with some really great poker players. I'm sure Vince McMahon is a hell of a poker player.
- I've had the opportunity to wrestle Daniel Bryan through several phases of his career, except for his time in WWE. What I remember is that he was great the first time I wrestled him, and he kept getting better every match afterward.
- I was fortunate that I was born in an era where comic books kind of grew up with me.
- I think, for an artist, when you're drawing somebody who actually exists, it's a much steeper critical curve, as there is an actual representation of that person out there. You can't just interpret it any way you want.
- You've got some very unique individuals in the WWE, and it's a completely different nexus on 'SmackDown' than it is on 'Raw.'
- There has never been a company that has wanted me, which sounds insane.
- You never know with Punk. He is definitely somebody who does things his own way, and I think the biggest thing is that you can never count out what his next move will be. I think no one would have predicted his move to UFC - nobody would have predicted a lot of things he does - so whatever he chooses to do, he will do what feels best in the moment.
- In WWE, they're real big on letting you sink or swim, and they let you go out there, and they're going to give you the stick and a live mic in front of a packed house and millions watching at home, and if you're not prepared for that moment, you're going to go down in flames.
- It's a surreal experience when you're working with guys like Scott Steiner, Kevin Nash, and Sting. They were guys that I grew up watching, and I saw the heights that they achieved.
- I love professional wrestling, and I love sports entertainment.
- I've seen the struggles and the heartache and the pain that goes along with being in the fight game.
- Anybody that got in your way or stopped you or barred your success, you either push through them or work around them. I don't have enough time for excuses or crying about people saying how someone wasn't given a proper opportunity. Nobody gave me an opportunity.
- If I do foray more into writing comic books, I definitely would hope that my acceptance is based more on my ability to write than my ability to schmooze my way in as a celebrity.
- I'm a pretty big gamer.
- I worked for my family's Polynesian dance troupe for my entire life up until I started wresting full time.
- I've always been aware of what I've been able to do and my ability to bring interest to a match and make people want to tune in and see.
- If Kurt Angle's leg fell off, he'd hop twice as fast to make up for the loss of mobility, man. There's no quit in him.
- I grew up watching Transformers. I think it was one of the first cartoons that I started watching as a kid. It was awesome. I would set my clock every morning before I went to school. It was a big part of my childhood.
- Anytime I've travelled to the Middle East, I've always experience the very best in hospitality. They are some of the most kind and wonderful people I've had the chance to meet, and I feel that Saudi Arabia shares those same qualities.
- My first remit when I came to WWE was to help build up NXT as a global brand. It was a mission that I took on fully and was more than willing to attack, and lo and behold, here we are.
- The sixth move of doom? Yeah. So John Cena went to China, took some lessons, and all of a sudden, now he's got a bad palm strike. Listen, I've been traveling the world for years and I've been beating up people with martial arts techniques from far superior styles and techniques. So, I ain't worried about that.
- I've always understood that wherever I've gone, I've helped build and I've helped make those companies bigger and better. NXT is no different.
- I was a judo player as a kid, and I think a lot of the concepts in judo as a kid played over. It influenced my style and has been a center point of what I do.
- Obviously, when you come to WWE, the level of spectacle and production in what we do is far and above anywhere else I worked, so it's kind of cool to be a part of the big show now.
- It was not very difficult for me to adjust in WWE because of my previous experience. Stylistically, this company is quite different from other promotions, but adapting to it is part of the job.
- Not a lot of people get into Brock Lesnar like I did. Brock is every bit as intimidating as you'd imagine he would be times two. No, I mean, he's a shaved gorilla. It's just, he's stronger than strong. I don't even think he even realizes how strong he is.
- It's always a benefit to have the fans kind of salivating at the thought of your debut, of you changing over brands.
- There is a good chance that, at 60, I will be in a wheelchair, but hey, I signed up for that. I know that.
- I think something that escapes a lot of people is my entire career... I call myself the 'often unwanted' because when I got to Ring of Honor, I was told it was supposed to be one-off deal.
- I think when you are dealing with Brock Lesnar, you have to show up ready to deal with Brock Lesnar. Brock is the type of guy who is not going to give you an inch. If you are going to get anything from him, you have to take it, and he's going to dare you to take it.
- The biggest thing here in WWE is that if they see some really valuable qualities in you, they're really going to do their best to maximize them and put you into the scenarios and into the situations where that's going to make the most impact. For me, they've definitely done that.
- Intimidation is an unusual animal: it's a lot about body language and understanding the human psyche. Knowing that usually a direct stare will crush most human souls, and that's just the basic gist of it... The soul-crushing stare, the fatherly disappointment, mixed with a little bit of hate and rage - you're on your way.
- After I made my initial debut at NXT 'TakeOver,' they looked at the interest and merchandise sales and decided I would be better signed full time than not.
- I know what I do well, and I know what I can do with other people.
- I think martial arts, in general, shaped my wrestling style. I think I grew up as a martial artist as a kid.
- I would like to see Jay Lethal and Dalton Castle join the company. Both have made their name in Ring of Honor, and their addition can make WWE a very exciting place.
- Mike Mulipola is a fantastic artist.
- I tremendously enjoyed my journey in professional wrestling, and I wouldn't want to trade a time or a place, even the low times, because it was those things that kind of tempered me and forged me and pushed me ahead to be here now.
- My experience at NXT was quite stellar.
- If you were to ask me would I change anything or could I go back to the past and change anything, I really wouldn't.
- There is definitely a Japanese influence on my style. I spent several years back and forth training over there, training at the New Japan Dojo in Los Angeles and picking up various techniques from wherever I go.
- I've always made my opportunities, I've never been one to wait for them and sit around waiting for something to happen. I've always sought them out.
- I think part of my journeys here and the places I was able to be at and the styles of wrestling I was able to experience and the friendships and just the world experience that I garnered before I came here to WWE helped me tremendously when I got here.
- I realize people feel a complex way about me and how I handle things compared to what I do in the ring.
- I think the biggest thing is kind of working everywhere and working with different people that, when I did walk through the door at WWE and looked around, I didn't really feel that out of place because every second face I looked at is somebody I've known for over a decade or worked with or I've been around in some capacity in the industry.
- For the majority of my career, I worked everywhere but the WWE.
- In the U.S., I've had the opportunity to grow up around a lot of Arab families, and the one thing that always stood out to me is the incredible hospitality; it's out of this world.
- I think when it comes to comics, I've been a lifelong comic book fan.
- People understand the simplicity of violence, and martial arts has always been about the more efficient way to deliver said violence upon an adversary. I've kept that philosophy as the focal point of what I do.
- You may not like the way I deliver the truth - you may take umbrage with the way I handle most of my conflicts - but that's the way I do business.
- I believe in simplicity. Where some people in TNA take the high-flying back flip route, I'll replace that with a punch or a nice kick square to the face.
- It's funny how many people that I've come across in my time that have gone on to achieve great success.
- I had always been involved in athletics throughout my life.
- I think, in general, when you talk about great wrestling towns in the history of the world, I think Memphis kind of shoots up there into the top three if not the top two.
- No matter what your background or where you are from, the one thing we can all respect is when great athletes and great passion leads to great achievements.
- Talent is one of the few things that can't be created. It can be enhanced - it can be coached and brought out of people - but you can't deny it.
- After I win the Championship, I'll be happy to take on anyone.
- If anything, I feel like I like to be ambitious.
- I've thought of the independents as a stable industry for a little over two decades, and that's because I stably worked in it, so I've understood it that way.
- People talk about the Kevin Owens/Sami Zayn relationship and how they'll be fighting forever, but in reality, when it comes to me and A.J. Styles, I defy anybody to find two guys who have been battling against each other longer than us.
- For me, I've always been confident in my ability and what I've been able to bring to the table - what I can bring to a Brock Lesnar matchup.
- I had the greatest deal in the history of professional wrestling. I could work for WWE, anybody else that I wanted to, and collect income from every one of those companies, including merchandise. It was a really good deal.
- For me, if you are not in it to be champion, you shouldn't be in it at all.
- Myself, there's people saying, 'He'll never find himself in the halls of WWE.' It's a narrative that's fueled more by secondhand fan myth than what people feel.
- John Cena is a name I will never forget, and in the Royal Rumble, he will be the first man that I eliminate.
- When it comes to WrestleMania, obviously you'll take whatever opportunity is put in front of you.
- As a child, I think everybody imitates their favorite cartoon character in some form or another when they're playing.
- If there's a game that comes out, I've pretty much got it, played it, and it's sitting here in my room.
- In your career, to walk away champion of the Greatest Royal Rumble would be something people will take with them for a lifetime.
- I think Conor McGregor is a promoter, and I'm not here to promote any of his fights. If he were here in WWE, that would be a different story, but until that happens, I don't feel like I need to address it.
- If you are going to do things in your life and be responsible for your career, then be responsible for your career. You are responsible for your success.
- I relish any chance to punch A.J. Styles in the face, because he's a man I respect greatly. And I find that I want to punch people in the face that I respect greatly. I like to say it's an island thing, but it's not: it' just something that I like doing.
- I always tell guys to get paid what you are worth and know what you are worth so that if you are worth it, you will get that number.
- It's all about starting momentum, hitting the ground running, and starting out hot.
- As long as you're confident in your skill set and what you can do, you're usually good to go.
- Anybody who has wanted me to go out there and pull some emotion out and act like we are going to get down, that's what I specialize in. That's fine. That's something that I do, and that's something that I've done over the breadth of my career. With Brock Lesnar, regardless of who he is, it was going to be no different.
- To kind of be on the forefront of things here in NXT is definitely a big feather in my cap.
- Backstage, I do my own thing and have my own spots in the locker room, so environmentally, it's not very different for me. But the backstage environments are vastly different, but that is mainly because of the personalities.
- NXT was at a really exciting place and transforming in and of itself, and I find it's always good to be around that kind of environment and those kinds of companies. It just felt right. It was a good fit.
- I'm a big believer in the idea that one of the greatest advantages we have here in the United States is freedom of expression and freedom of speech. You should be able to say whatever you want, and I firmly believe that.
- When it came to eliciting a reaction from an audience, especially at the time, I think Ric Flair is the guy who is constantly up there. Especially when you talk about speaking with passion and being able to convey a ton of emotion with his words and his body language.
- I'm not worried about my WrestleMania dream. Trust me. I'm showing up at WrestleMania, and when I do, it's going to be a problem for everybody.
- I don't care where you go or what company you work for - and I've pretty much worked for them all - WWE by far is the most brutal road schedule in the world. It takes a special kind of individual to navigate that and be able to thrive in that environment. It's a challenge that I've enjoyed.
- Shinsuke - he is by far one of the best competitors in the world. It is no surprise to me that he found his way to WWE.
- I think our sport evolves as the talent evolves and the mindset evolves.
- When guys are in NXT - not me, but the guys who are signed to developmental deals that are there - they're setting up the ring. They're tearing it down. They're working every day at the PC. And it's arduous training, man. Those guys go through a lot.
- In reality, you just don't see many Samoan artists. Culturally, it's just not something that's really emphasized much - at least, hand-drawn art.
- I've proved I'm a formidable opponent.
- I come in with the highest goals in mind whenever I approach anything.
- They've kind of backed off and allowed me to do what I do. I think that's the biggest testament is that they know when to have a hand in things, and they know when to back off, let me work, and let me do my thing. During my time in NXT, they have definitely done that.
- This is a dream match to many people in this world... Me vs. Brock Lesnar is what people really want.
- John Cena's match with me, the one that kind of got him hired with WWE, I remember they were there to look at John, obviously. He looked great - he was like the blue-chipper - and John was a good friend of mine, so I had no problem whatsoever helping him kind of highlight and do his thing.
