- One of the responsibilities faced by the Environmental Genome Project is to provide the science base upon which society can make better informed risk management decisions.
- Moreover, environmental health at the local level has become narrowly focused, very much defined around regulations and the attendant regulatory debates.
- While the Environmental Genome Project does not seek to assign allele frequencies, we are aware of the importance of accurate allele frequency estimates for future epidemiologic studies and the large sample sizes such estimates will require.
- I am also actively involved in my church and its community activities. We have programs to improve the lives of our congregation and programs of outreach in the community.
- The infrastructure for linking environmental health and public health is not working as well as it should.
- There is no doubt that environmentally related diseases will continue to pose problems in the future.
