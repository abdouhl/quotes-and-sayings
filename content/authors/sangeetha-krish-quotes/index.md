- I used to watch several films a day when I was a kid. This made me think about taking up acting as a career.
- Krish is very simple and down-to-earth, loves me and respects my work as an actress, so much that he gets offended when people criticize my performances.
- Dhanam' is one of the interesting scripts that I came across. It centers around me.
- When actors do anti-hero roles, they are critically acclaimed. When heroines do negative roles, they are sidelined from the industry.
- I only take up roles that really appeal to me, and like to break the rules as an actress.
- Generally a heroine appears in a couple of songs in skimpy costumes and disappears. I am fortunate to do such a lengthy role in 'Dhanam.'
- I have proved my skills as an actress who can perform both character and glamour roles and 'Uyir' would take me to greater heights.
- In 'Puthran', a film by Jayabarathi of 'Kudisai' fame, I had shared the screen space with veteran Y Gee Mahendra. It is a very challenging role which demanded a lot from me.
- Thankfully 'Uyir' happened. Things have changed for good since then.
- When I did 'Uyir,' I initially feared to do it. It was a controversial role. But thanks to my friends, they motivated me and helped me come out with aplomb.
- I shy away from doing heroine-dominated subjects.
- I thank my directors who keep faith in my acting credentials and give me roles like I did in 'Uyir' and 'Dhanam.'
- Acting in a heroine-oriented film is a tough job.
- Much prior to my marriage, I loved donning homely-girl roles and perhaps now I can tread taking up best of that sort.
- After 'Pithamagan,' I took a break scouting for good offers.
- Once 'Uyir' created a controversy, I had several offers coming my way with prominence to my character. However, I avoided them purposefully.
- I play the role of my career in 'Dhanam.'
- I politely refuse to be part of movies where I have to do sister or sister-in-law to protagonists.
- I am a fan of actor Richard Gere. When he came to Hyderabad for an AIDS awareness programme, I went up and shook hands with him.
- I have played lead roles, supporting roles and also miniscule roles in my career so far, and have never been image conscious.
- I had acted opposite Sathyaraj in 'Uchchi Thanai Mugarndhal.' It was a role which some actresses refused to do.
- I am very choosy and keen to do good roles.
- I just did what the script demanded from me in 'Uyir.' I felt it was indeed a challenging role for me.
- I was not interested in films, but I was forced to act when I was just 14 or 15 years old. Now, I feel that that was not the right age to enter films. One should at least be 21 to enter the industry.
- I feel that confidence is the essence for a good performance.
- In 'Dhanam,' I play a call girl, who has revolutionary ideas.
- Success doesn't matter to me. I believe in performance.
- My grandfather, K.R. Balan, a pioneer in the film industry, wanted me to try my hand at acting.
- I think in more ways than one 'Uyir' did a lot good, getting the scope to perform. Things have really fallen in place since then. Breaking free of the shackles has given me the rich option to choose and pick from the range of characters coming my way.
- In fact, I just play a glamour doll in 'Vijayendra Varma,' for the first time in my career.
- It was only in 'Khadgam' that I learnt to project myself and carry off an image of a celebrity, which is very different from what I am in real life.
