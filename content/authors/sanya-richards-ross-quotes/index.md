- For all of my life I'd been extremely healthy. I'd never had any health issues, so to go from being perfectly healthy to having this very rare disease was scary. In a lot of people it is very severe. Some people go blind, you can have neuro-lesions which affect your brain, so I was very nervous.
- My favorite healthy foods are Jamaican chicken soup, Jamaican chicken stew peas, Jamaican brown stew chicken, plantains and banana chips.
- Most of the time our events aren't in the papers and they're not televised, so people don't know when we're competing.
- I can't live without eyeliner.
- I feel as healthy as I've ever felt.
- Sometimes I say the medication is even tougher than the illness.
- My indulgences are Skittles and rum raisin ice cream.
- A lot of times in sport if you try to tell the truth it seems like an excuse.
