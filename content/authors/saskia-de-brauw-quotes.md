- I like to wear skirts long or short.
- Being perceived as a guy is nothing new or complicated to me. It is what it is.
- I've been 6 ft. 2 ins. since I was 13.
- When you have to do all the more crappy jobs before, you appreciate all the good work that comes out of that. There are many girls who immediately have a top model career, and there are lots of models who are doing things that aren't as exciting as doing big campaigns and beautiful magazines.
- I've been to places that otherwise I wouldn't have been able to go to, and seen things I wouldn't have seen, if I didn't have the job.
- I would wear a top that is not very tight. I would probably wear a scarf, which I find one of the best pieces of clothing there is.
- I would definitely wear flat menswear-like shoes.
- I think it would be a lot easier if I said, 'I feel like a dude,' but I was raised by a southern mom, so I know how to put on lipstick and walk in heels and rock that look. It's exactly that juxtaposition that confuses people.
- I remember as a teen being able to eat more than my father. I was growing so fast and my body couldn't keep up.
- The travel, the amazing work I have had the chance to do, the meetings with different people are all very inspiring and give me lots of positive energy.
- I see myself as quite feminine. But many people seem to think differently about that; sometimes people mistake me for a man. In Paris I often hear 'bonjour monsieur'.
- Time plays an important role. My physical body is taking shape in space, and I see that my ideas about how we influence space with our movement is really 'matter of fact.'
- Everyone has ways of trying to find a way to memorise our past. There's something very poetic about that.
- I am far from perfect, but I have something else. I heard that people in the industry are longing for more personality and diversity. Perhaps I am more a 'character' than a model.
- When I think of myself at 15, even 17, I could simply not have done this work on an international level and travel all the time, take care of myself and not feel lost. I feel very happy that this is happening now, and not 10 years ago, as I feel stronger as a person.
- Hedi Slimane told me I was boyish in his eyes. For him femininity and masculinity are the same thing, the difference is not so interesting, he said.
- I like to go to bed early. And I am not a bad cook at all.
- We leave traces with our energy and vibrations. We leave something of ourselves behind everywhere were we pass. This is what always fascinates and inspires me.
- I'm always interested in the moment when lives somehow accidentally cross. I think sometimes those accidental meetings can be small miracles; they can really change one's perspective on that moment and on life.
- I never had worked in high fashion before, had never experienced it when I was a model before. I appreciate it, being able to work with such talented people; it feels like a gift now. I think for everyone everything happens at the right time, and this is my time.
- Working as a model is high-speed, and my own work in every sense is super slow and doubtful.
