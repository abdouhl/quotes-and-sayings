- A window covered with raindrops interests me more than a photograph of a famous person.
- I like it when one is not certain what one sees. When we do not know why the photographer has taken a picture and when we do not know why we are looking at it, all of a sudden we discover something that we start seeing. I like this confusion.
- I may be old-fashioned. But I believe there is such a thing as a search for beauty - a delight in the nice things in the world. And I don't think one should have to apologise for it.
- My family was very unhappy about my becoming a photographer - profoundly and deeply unhappy.
- Photography is about finding things. And painting is different - it's about making something.
- I am not immersed in self-admiration.
- Being ignored is a great privilege. That is how I think I learned to see what others do not see and to react to situations differently. I simply looked at the world, not really prepared for anything.
- I spent a great deal of my life being ignored. I was always very happy that way.
- In order to build a career and to be successful, one has to be determined. One has to be ambitious. I much prefer to drink coffee, listen to music, and to paint when I feel like it.
- I've never been overwhelmed with a desire to become famous. It's not that I didn't want to have my work appreciated, but for some reason - maybe it's because my father disapproved of almost everything I did - in some secret place in my being was a desire to avoid success.
- There are the things that are out in the open, and there are the things that are hidden. The real world has more to do with what is hidden.
- I like the Zen artists: they'd do some work, and then they'd stop for a while.
- What makes anyone think that I'm any good?
- I'm sometimes mystified by people who keep diaries. I never thought of my existence as being that important.
- I have been told that some of my photographs maybe indicate that I am a painter.
- My father thought photography was done by lowlifes.
- When I am listening to Vivaldi or Japanese music or making spaghetti at 3 in the morning and realize that I don't have the proper sauce for it, fame is of no use.
- My brothers were rabbis. My grandfather was a rabbi.
- Sometimes I'm amazed by how much you can do as a photographer.
