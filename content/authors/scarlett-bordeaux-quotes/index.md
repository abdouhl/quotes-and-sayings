- I'm a theater major.
- Ring of Honor has become a place I call a second home. The locker room is really my second family, they support me and I couldn't do it without them.
- Appearing at TNA for the first time was extremely important to me due to the high visibility.
- Every woman - we like being called pretty. We like being called sexy.
- I'm going for the Knockouts Championship.
- I wasn't allowed to watch it as a little kid but I went with some friends who were some big independent wrestling fans and I saw it, I fell in love with it. Very quickly, I asked if I could help set up the ring, set up chairs, just be around it.
- It makes me feel powerful - being sexy. That's for me, its not for everybody.

- I can never see myself working a nine-to-five.
- I always hope my stuff does well and I see myself as someone who works very hard and I can see my own value.
- If I want to wrestle, I should be able to wrestle. If I want to be sexy, I should be allowed to be sexy. If I want to come out wearing a potato sack, I should be allowed to do that too.
- I trained at a conservatory as a mezzo-soprano and was a musical theater major in college so I had a theater background.
- I'm a broadway girl, so anytime someone would sing my entrance music, that was probably my absolute favorite thing.
