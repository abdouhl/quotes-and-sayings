- I really love Andrew Dominik's movies. When you work with someone whose movies you really love and who you have a lot of admiration for, you turn into putty in their hands.
- I love L.A. It was an awesome place to spend my 20s, full of creative people, but I never wanted to stay there. It wasn't necessarily Texas that I wanted to move to; I just knew I wanted to live in the country somewhere. My wife and I found this place in Texas that we really liked, so we packed up our stuff and moved.
- I just want to keep laying down really great, strong characters, and the more I go unrecognized, the better job I feel I'm doing.
- To have three movies coming out at the same time - I probably will never have that again in my life.
- I want my career to grow gradually. There's still so much for me to learn. I'm just trying to take these opportunities to get better at what I'm doing.
- I've been asked, 'What was your big break?' I don't feel like I've had a big break. It's been a slow, slow break.
- I've been doing independent films for 10 years, but one out of five didn't see the light of day.
- In no way do I want to draw attention to myself.
- I did theater as a kid, more of an after-school program. But every night I would put on a movie and fall asleep to it.
- 'Stand By Me' was really great for me and my buddies; we'd all watch that together because that was us - we were down in the creek and hanging out every day and going on little adventures. I had about sixteen friends who are all about the same age as me and lived in a three-block radius. We spent our entire childhood down in that creek.
