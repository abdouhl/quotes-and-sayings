- I don't know, 53 years with the same human being? I can't be around myself for more than three or four hours before I want to kill everybody.
- If I'm racist, don't think I would have directed shows like 'The Parkers' and 'The Wayans Brothers' or worked 41 episodes with Victoria Rowell on 'Diagnosis: Murder.'
- I can work every day of the year. TV is easy. My call's at 8:30 a.m. I'd like to break out of the comedy thing and take a shot at something serious like theater. The off-season allows me to do movies, but I'm not tired of TV yet. There's nothing like it. I've got the best of both worlds.
- Every day I think, 'Can I commit?' I think I can and that I will.
- One of my favorite things to do is play golf at Braemar Country Club. It's quiet and not overly crowded. The people are nice, and there's wildlife all around the course. As far as my game itself, I can go from a 10 handicap to a 30, depending on the day.
- Tom Bosley may have passed, but through that part and that character, a part of him will live on forever.
- I've been very fortunate and I am grateful.
- I very rarely came across rude or disrespectful people. I don't know how I slipped by all of them, but I honestly can't think of one experience off the top of my head that was like that. I'm sure they're there, but I'd have to think really hard to recall them.
- It's a werewolf movie with Christina Ricci, and it was a chance to work with some good people. But playing yourself is always fairly risky because you gotta watch how you goof on yourself.
- I don't have an iPod. I don't get the whole iPod thing. Who has time to listen to that much music? If I had one, it would probably have Sinatra, Beatles, some '70s music, some '80s music, and that's it.
- My parents were married 53 years, good and bad. Can I do that? Probably not. But I really hope I can.
- I regret losing certain women, but it was always my fault.
- When I was a baby, my mother tells me I never slept because I never wanted to miss anything.
- You can tell five minutes into it what a girl is after, when she starts asking how much money I make or tells me, 'I wanna be an actress.'
- I love driving cars, looking at them, cleaning and washing and shining them. I clean 'em inside and outside. I'm very touchy about cars. I don't want anybody leaning on them or closing the door too hard, know what I mean?
- I am not a spiritual guy, but all of a sudden I felt the need to really feel things.
- If I lived alone, Mom'd never sleep because she wouldn't know I was okay.
- When I have a girlfriend, I feel caged in, I don't know why.
- Family, work, familiarity. Listen, if I had a magic wand and I could make myself really be happy, I'd zap me onto a farm. And I know nothing about farming.
- I cannot believe how much I love my kid. It's a beautiful thing.
- One thing I won't be doing on a weekend is shopping. I just don't like it, and I haven't bought an article of clothing for a very long time. I usually just take wardrobe from shows I'm on. It's much easier.
- Don't ever take a shower with a woman, because you'll probably end up proposing to her.
- I never did drugs and I can't really drink because I have zero tolerance for alcohol, so my vice became women. I was never faithful to most of them.
- Somebody asked me what do you regret. I said, well I was offered the role of Maverick in 'Top Gun' and I turned it down.
- Life is too short no matter what party you are with.
