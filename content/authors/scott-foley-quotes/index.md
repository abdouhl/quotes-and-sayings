- I have a quad rep in my house, so I'm doing bench presses and pull ups on that, any sort of basic strength movements I can do at home.

- I love the industry that I'm in. I love what I do, and I've sort of grown from being an actor and being on set. I take it all in, and I talk to the grips and the Best Boys and talk to lighting guys. I talk to everybody and see what they do and pay close attention.
- I never took my SAT's. I never applied to college. I moved right out here and jumped into the thick of things. Whether that was the smart move or not, I'm sitting here talking to you now, so it paid off.
- I know, just from directing television, where you have a huge support system of producers and writers and a script supervisor - not just the cast but a crew of 100 people - there are, as a director, hundreds of questions that you have to answer every day.
- Do I seem to play characters that in the end don't get the girl? Maybe. But you don't always get the girl or the guy, and there has to be someone to play that.

- Patrick Wilson is my brother-in-law - we married sisters.
- I am going to be on 'True Blood.' It was really exciting. I had a great time shooting it. I spent the last nine months shooting this season and it was very secretive, very sexy, a lot of blood and fangs.
