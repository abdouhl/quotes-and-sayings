- Carrying law enforcement ID connects you with those who do the same and separates you from those who don't. There's an implicit trust that you will serve even if means risking your life.
- When I was a kid, I had scarlet fever. I wasn't supposed to have survived it. When I got out of bed, my bones were so soft that they kind of bent. I had a slight limp for probably three years after.
- I've been doing martial arts since I was 9.
- I feel like, in some ways, I couldn't be a luckier actor to have Stick from 'Daredevil' and Senior from 'The Leftovers.' Two really different, incredible parts to do. I'm just lucky.
- Good balance makes you a better dancer, musician, actor - anything.
- Working with film directors helps me grow, but nothing like the incremental jumps I make onstage.
- I've always been addicted to adrenaline.
- I got into an argument with someone because I said I think 2Pac will be regarded as a great poet. They said he was just a punk gangster. People said the same thing about Francois Villon, and he's now considered the best French Romantic poet of all time.
- 'The Leftovers' is my favorite job I've ever had in my life, anywhere, ever. It is one of the greatest TV shows ever made.
- I'm sure one reason I became an actor is my basic unwillingness to live one life.
- The more time you spend with any character, whether it's from a comic book universe or a really naturalistic universe, the more time you spend, the more that character just becomes another aspect of yourself.
- Someone asked me what part of the body is the most important to be strong - it's the big toe. The big toe especially, and the inner front-third of your feet, are what give you balance and will make you infinitely better at any sport, any physical activity and, as you get older, will keep you from falling.
- I've never been bitten by a shark, though God knows I had to poke a lot of them in the nose.
- Acting gives you cosmic permission to take a trip in movies that lasts 24 hours a day, seven days a week, until the film is finished.
- My life is stupidly physical.
- I knew that acting is like anything - you learn from doing it.
- I don't think rodeo is cruel at all. Bullriding is the only man-animal event that makes sense.
- I worked as a truck driver, carpenter's assistant, doing whatever it took to keep bread on the table for the family.
- There is no such thing as too much rehearsal. When Daniel Day-Lewis told Steven Spielberg he needed a year for 'Lincoln,' I understand that.
- In terms of working out, I'm in the gym, maximum, twice a week, but for a pretty intense period of time: two or two and a half hours nonstop. Most of the exercises are body weight. We're talking pull-ups, chin-ups, decline rows, elevated push-ups.
- I love poetry - just to read it and be around it.
- For me, the first thing that I respond to - whether it's doing a play or movie or television or anything - is just the character. Is this a guy whose shoes I want to walk in for the next 12 days or six months?
- Rodeo riders are the last of the true chivalrous groups of people. It's a place where the competition is really pure.
- One of the sports I do - my wife thinks I'm nuts - is open-water spear fishing, what we call blue-water hunting. We get in a boat, and we go offshore, normally about 30 miles. So when you jump off the boat, there are no reefs, and the bottom is no longer fifty or a hundred feet: it's thousands of feet. It's sort of like being in outer space.
- As human beings, we anthropomorphize way too much. God's not a person. God, for me, is a power that lies outside the definition of time and space.
- There really, truly is a code that rodeo men and women have you can't find anywhere else. There really is a code. It's a sense of tribalism.
- I used to be an open-spear fisherman, and if you're looking for fish, you're never going to see them. In an almost meditative state, you have to pick out anomalies, something out of the ordinary.
