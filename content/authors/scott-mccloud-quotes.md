- If you think about it, for any kind of content on the web, the natural price per unit of these things should be under a dollar.
- It would take a lifetime to read all the webcomics published in one year.

- My first influences were superhero artists.
- All through my comics career, I was always trying to reinvent the form.
- It wasn't until I discovered comics that I actually began to approach drawing as a possible career.
- I don't think the potential for comics in nonfiction has been exploited nearly as much as it could be.

- When you're free of editorial control, you owe it to yourself to obtain feedback from friends and readers. Some take those criticisms to heart and incorporate it into their work, and some ignore them.
- The notion of getting under the hood and explaining how something works, that's fairly familiar territory to me.
- I had a lot of ideas on how comics worked and pretty early on I had this idea that it would be fun to explain them in comics form.
