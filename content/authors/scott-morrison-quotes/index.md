- Firms gain comparative advantage from how good their people are. Retaining and attracting talent is a key point of competitive advantage in the global economy. We are seeing that play out, and there are implications for Australia, too. The idea that companies now compete on who can pay their workers the lowest - that's all changing.

- I remember when we came in, in 2013, and I was implementing our border protection policy, people threw their hands up - and I said, 'I'm doing what I said I would do in the way I said I'd do it' - and guess what: I'm now getting the results I said I'd get.
- I can understand that people who have a very different view to mine are motivated by the purest of motives. All I ask is that they might give the same benefit of the doubt to those with whom they might disagree with.

- One of the marks of our economic management is that we've always exceeded expectations.
- Our job... as we take forward this mantle of leadership as a new generation is to ensure that we not only bring our party back together, which has been bruised and battered this week, but that... we bring the parliament back together.
