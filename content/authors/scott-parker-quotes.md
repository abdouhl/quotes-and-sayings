- We live in a world and a profession where you win a game, you lose the next one and you're deemed a failure.
- The facts are, the reality is, you can't really enjoy it. You win a football match and by the time you get to Saturday night, having a beer or a Chinese, you're already thinking about Monday morning, the next game.
- I am really into looking as smart as I can and have been since I was a kid.
- On the field, I was probably coaching more, helping players and doing my coaching badges.

- Confidence is the most key thing in football.
- There is always going to be a point where your form becomes patchy and it's down to how long it lasts really.
- I used a psychologist when I was playing, It's one of the most powerful things: how you can have a concrete head and not let things in.
- As a young lad you go on adrenalin. You run out, look at the crowd, run around at 100mph and you can do it.
- When my boy has lost 4-0 on a Sunday morning, I'm the Dad in the car saying: 'OK mate, don't worry, we can do this or do that'. When I got in the car after losing a game I sat in the backseat and had to keep my mouth closed.
- World-class midfield players get their share of goals and that's something I want to add to my game.
- When I watch the best in the world, I want to be like them. We all have a fascination, all of us, with Spain.

- When I stop playing I'll want a new challenge. I couldn't just do nothing.

- I'm familiar with Bournemouth because of my relationship with Harry Arter. It's a football club I know well from watching him over the years.
- I defend and track my runners but, if there's another big asset you need as a midfielder, it's to score goals. I scored goals in the reserves and the youth team but since I've got into the first team I've lost that a little bit.
- Of course there's a technical element but nine times out of 10 when you're having a bad day it will mainly be mental: the mistake you've made, the comment you've heard, the crowd's reaction to a shot over the bar - fter that the fear's coming in.
- When you're at a football club, the heart and soul of it is bigger than a win or a loss, so I'd like to think I leave the football club in a good place.
