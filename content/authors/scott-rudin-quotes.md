- I love work. I love putting together a group of people who are all doing the same thing. The commonality of purpose.
- I don't particularly have a wide social circle.
- That's my goal, to feel like I've done the best I could. When I've done that, anything else that happens is a bonus.
- Those critics awards come and go every year, but the finished movie is your work.
- They say there's no second act in American lives. There's something there worth exploring. Giving up an idea of yourself, examining your failure, and seeing if that failure was the system's or yours. What does it mean to not turn out to be the person you want to be?

- I think you have a responsibility to the people you're making movies with, and I take that very seriously. I don't want to let up and I don't want to let down.

- Success is extremely ephemeral and very hard to hold onto.
- I always loved doing a movie with Daldry. That's always a huge factor for me.
- I keep my overhead as low as I can.
- You read a script, you try and think through what is the best, most wide-ranging way of telling the story: who stylistically, character-logically, psychologically fits inside the world of what you're trying to do. A lot of it, when you're casting, is trying to get yourself in the head of a director.
- I was 10 years old, taking the train by myself to see Saturday matinees, something you'd never let a kid do now. I got very hooked on it.
- I have a big affinity for the Coen Brothers.
- I do what I feel I know how to do and don't do things that I don't. I'm a product of my sensibility.
- I loved doing casting because I love actors, and I am very conscious of what actors do. But I always wanted to be a producer.
- You always feel the ground rumbling beneath your feet, and if you don't, you're an idiot. Mostly because it is rumbling beneath your feet, and there is always someone who is coming up behind you who is as good, younger, and, at least as you perceive it, has more energy and more nimbleness than you.
- If you're going to spend two or three years of your life working on something, you've got to be making the kind of movie that discusses and influences the culture and is engaged in the world you're living in.
- Private emails between friends and colleagues written in haste and without much thought or sensitivity, even when the content of them is meant to be in jest, can result in offense where none was intended.

- The movies that work are the ones in which somebody very smart figured out how to take all the thematic material, all the character material, all the filigree, all the beautiful writing, and put it into a story.
- I was once a fairly angry person.
- The best adaptations are the ones that really excavate the material. The movies that work are the ones in which somebody very smart figured out how to take all the thematic material, all the character material, all the filigree, all the beautiful writing and put it into a story.
- Anybody who understands how a movie gets made understands that a deep-pockets player is not going to make a movie that has anything defamatory in it without protections.
- I know that movies are basically meant to be entertainment, but I'm not that interested in entertainment.
- I've done a lot of movies based on real people, real situations, non-fiction books, magazine articles, life rights.
- 'The Social Network' was probably one of the two or three things I've done in my life that I'm most proud of. I'm not going to engage in what about it was disappointing. There's nothing about it I was disappointed in.
- You want reviews to come the week the movie's opening and not a month before when they do you absolutely no good.
