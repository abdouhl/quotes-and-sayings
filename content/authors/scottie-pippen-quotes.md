- I remember the night in December 2005 when the Bulls retired my number and will never, ever forget it.
- I've come a long way from my first commercials.
- While I dealt with my share of injuries throughout my career, I was fortunate to have been healthy for the majority of our run in the 1990s. The same can be said about Michael Jordan.
- If things work out for you as a team, then there are individual things that happen for you. But if you're not talented enough as a team, its hard for people to give you the recognition.
