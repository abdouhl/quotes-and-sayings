- I think that's the greatest gift she gave us, this normal upbringing without her fame hanging over our heads. It actually prepared us for the world.
- I remember being mesmerized by 'Love in the Afternoon,' with Gary Cooper.
- Because by the time I went to the village school in Switzerland, we're talking about September 1965, she was finishing 'Wait Until Dark' which was released in '66. That's when she gave up being an actress to be a full-time mom - in a farmhouse with fruit trees.
- It's very difficult to have a conversation about yourself when you're the granddaughter of Audrey Hepburn, as it was difficult for me to have a conversation about something without, 'What was she like? What was she really like?'
- President Kennedy visited once, but that was in Switzerland and I remember the Secret Service men dressed in black swarming about the house.
- I'm often asked what it was like to have a famous mother. I always answer that I really don't know. I knew her first as my mother, and then as my best friend. Only after that did I understand that she was an actress, and with time that she was truly an exceptional actress.
- I don't feel like so many other celebrities' kids, who hate their parents for abandoning them.
- Once the war started, my grandfather went to England, where he was under house arrest on the Isle of Man, and then to Ireland, but not to Germany. In no way did he, or my grandmother for that matter, ever support either the war or the Holocaust.
- Not only did she represent inner and outer beauty and elegance, but all the work she did at the end of her life touched so many people. She created this extraordinary legacy.
- But I believe that the huge advances now being made in genetic research will be the key to personalized medicine one day.
- One of the reasons that fascism ascended to power so quickly was that it was considered socially elegant to support this new way of government.
- My mother used to tell me, 'I'm fake thin, but don't tell anyone.' I think part of her reputation for dieting too much was to do with her upper body and thoracic cage being thinner than average, thus her thin waist.
- We are brought together by the great feelings and it is the little stuff that breaks us apart.
- You have to dream in a wholesome way, not just dream about yourself, but dream about what's best for all.
- You know, we're not a film buff family.
- Even now, we're surprised by the reach of my mum, so you can imagine our surprise at the interest in my daughter. We got calls from Hollywood companies wanting to do a reality show with her and we thought, 'About what? We're not a Hollywood family.'
- My mother always told me, 'I didn't make a perfume or go sell toilet paper. I did something good with my name.'
- I grew up in the countryside as a normal kid.
- My stepfather was a brilliant and funny psychiatrist but he was a hound dog. He just didn't know how to be faithful.
- Once in a while, people would say, 'Look, your mom's on TV.' But as a young kid, you don't really worry about those things so much.
- I can see how movie stars lose touch with reality. I can understand that, because you're told a million times a day in so many little gestures that you're somehow special and unique.
- When I had to go to school and could no longer travel to be with her on the set, she gave up her career. She felt the most valuable thing was family.
- If she looks natural on screen, that's just the way she was in life - very unassuming and full of life.
- We learned to separate, and accept the fact that my mother is gone, yet there she is on TV, on a billboard, sooner or later in a conversation, in a magazine on a regular basis.
- Communism and fascism were born out of frustration with an establishment that still knew royalty and possessed very few of the characteristics we commonly attribute to democracy today.
- I think that emotional marks are made early on. Even if you can rationalize them as you grow up, they still leave that dank sadness you can never truly shake.
- It's not just a world of dog-eat-dog and Trumps and all of this... there are people and there is hope and you can still get there and have a reasonable measure of success and appreciation.
- My father was a difficult and demanding man.
- She lost a couple of pregnancies before me. It was sort of this great healing for her to finally have a child.
- We weren't a home-movie kind of a family. When that's your work and you have to do it for a living, when it's Christmastime, you don't want to see a camera in the room.
- She often used to talk about the fact that during the war, her mother, because there was a little food and no heating, would have her stay in bed throughout the day, especially during the Dutch Hunger Winter, to preserve her calories.
- We all came from a culture of you got to keep moving, you got to keep doing.
- My mother was a biographer's dream and a nightmare. She was a dream because she was a classic to write about and everybody loves her. She was a nightmare because there are no scandals, quasi-cruelties, no really juicy stuff.
- We tend to perceive Hollywood as an industry that is trying to mitigate risk more and more.
- Her secret to happiness was simple and unpretentious. She had a beautiful house, would pick fruit and make jams, run the dogs in the fields, have a whiskey at five o'clock and cook a great plate of pasta. It wasn't complicated.
- Children, like animals, and believe me, that's a compliment in my world, feel the difference. They know where the truth lies. They can feel it in a minute if someone is genuine.
- We're fortunate to have this extraordinary foundation of, I guess, not growing up in Hollywood and growing up in this farmhouse in Switzerland. She wanted a normal life for herself and for us. And it's a valuable and beautiful memory that she left us.
- I was born in Switzerland and raised all over Europe, basically.
- She was just my mum, end of story. She was just the mum that wakes up in the morning with a sleepy head, who helps you do your homework, picks you up from school, takes you shopping for books and socks, and cares for you when you're sick.
- In her heart my mother much preferred the intense few days of shelling, which brought freedom, to the languishing fear she felt every time she stood by waiting for the Nazi troops and later for the SS to march by, singing their songs of victory and supremacy.
- She didn't want the typical Hollywood lifestyle of juggling a career and leaving the kids at home with nannies, so she'd take me to buy socks and books and help me with my homework.
- I'm always opening magazines and seeing pictures of her in advertisements. Or I'll be in a hotel room in Tokyo and there she will be, on the television. Or I'll be walking through an airport or driving along a freeway and there she will be on a billboard.
- I believe that you can't know courage without conquering fear, and you can't really know joy without knowing sadness.
- I saw both sides, I saw normality in Switzerland as a kid and later on I saw the insanity of it all in Italy, which almost becomes hard to live with.
- I've learnt to separate the woman who was my mother from the person who was a movie star. The star has survived, my mother didn't.
- An interesting question that has been recurring is that she appears to have been this delicate woman in all these films, but really she was a woman of substance wasn't she? And I say yes, you don't get to be Audrey Hepburn if you are a sort of 'babe in the woods.' It takes a lot of character, a lot of vision, good boundaries and hard work.
- You know, we weren't a Hollywood family. I didn't grow up in a home with screening rooms and my mother didn't behave like a movie star.
- I didn't end her career. She chose to have children, then to make the simple choice that everyone should make really. You can't be a movie star and have children and not have one of the two suffer.
- People say to me, 'What do you think your mother would think about this new world with Instagram?' And I pause and I just say, 'Well, she really was the queen of Instagram because she was more photographed than anyone else.'
- Soon we moved to Rome and I got a little bit of a sense I was different because the paparazzi would follow me when I went to buy books or socks. But my mother never behaved like a movie star.
- She trained as a ballet dancer yet she was an iron fist in a velvet glove. My younger brother Luca and I had a wonderful childhood since she would try to guide us gently down the right path.
- I find that 'Taare Zameen Par' is one of the most beautiful movies ever made about the inner world of a child.
- This woman who was a style icon basically lived in a little cotton dress all her life - a simple life.
- It wasn't until I was 14 that I finally saw her films. We found an old 16-millimeter projector in the attic, put up a bedsheet - I ironed it myself - and watched reels that were given to her by Paramount.
- The love of a parent is as much nutrition as a chocolate bar.
- Her mother was a Christian Scientist who didn't believe in calling doctors. So when my mother caught whooping cough as a baby, stopped breathing and turned blue, her mother revived her by spanking her on the bottom. She saw life itself as a gift and saw her own survival as precious and a matter of chance.
- English is my last language.
- I believe my mother's immune system was harmed because of all the vaccinations she needed to visit different countries, when her body was already weakened after an impoverished wartime childhood.
- It's OK to choose your path, have a dream, not a fake one, and never let it get to your head then.
- I have a passion to make something that's good, not merely OK.
- Because I fell in love with the idea of films early on, not because I was in the milieu, but moreso because of the potential of having a couple of hundred people in a dark room, looking at a screen.
- I read an article some years back in which Emma Thompson demeaned my mother's acting ability. My mother would be the first person to say that she wasn't the best actress in the world. But she was a movie star.
- She was humble and put herself down. She felt her feet were a little too big and she had a bump on her nose and a crooked tooth. But she didn't get the tooth fixed. She didn't get the nose broken and set straight. She worked with what she had.
- A child deserves love, affection, the chance to just play and do nothing, to sit under a tree, read a book, dream and not have a care in the world.
- She was a wonderful mother. She was my best friend. Same for my brother. And it's funny because we didn't grow up in Hollywood. You know, once she decided that she needed to be a mother, she really gave up her career.
- I don't know if my mum and President Kennedy ever dated, but they were friends and there are some letters from him that she kept - sweet and innocent letters saying, 'Saw you in the play the other night and you were fantastic.'
- She was a lioness. She was described as an iron fist in a velvet glove. She needed that culture and background to survive in the world of Hollywood where you have to fight for everything.
- My mother was not very good about keeping clothes; if they were outdated, she'd give them to an aunt or cousins or museums.
- Sometimes I will discover a whole shoot of my mother I have never seen before.
- She was brave and would try anything. But she was never very confident. She didn't even think she was particularly beautiful - which turned out to be a good thing because it made her act like a real person instead of a sex symbol.
- We had a good education, but we didn't walk away feeling better than anybody else.
- My mother often used to speak about her time during the war and during the famous hunger winter in Holland - in the latter part of the war there was no heating and very little food and so her mother used to say, 'You stay in bed most of the day to preserve your calories.'
- I also was deeply touched by 'The Nun's Story' because it was the first time I saw my mother in something other than a romantic comedy.
- Our mother believed in education above all.
- I didn't grow up in Hollywood - the place, or the state of mind.
- She performed for the Dutch Resistance, not just to raise money but also to entertain people and to take their minds off the horrors they were living through. They would do plays and little musicals, trying to be discreet and not bring the attention of the soldiers.
- During her illness we received bags and bags of anything you can imagine, from get well cards to origami from Japan to medications. The mail lady used to come on a little moped - and she had to rent the mail truck from the town next door because she had to lug these bags to our door with thousands of cards we couldn't even open.
- My mother believed strongly that every life matters. She demonstrated on a daily basis, particularly through her humanitarian work as a Goodwill Ambassador for UNICEF, her strong belief in the value of every life.
