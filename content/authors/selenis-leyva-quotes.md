I worked on 'The Following,' I worked on 'Elementary,' I worked on a pilot and then I got 'Orange.' So literally from that moment of deep surrender, that's when you're blessed.

- I did sketch comedy with a troupe at the Nuyorican Poets Cafe.

- In my household, everything happens in the kitchen. My parents have this pretty big home, and it doesn't matter how big it is, we will all squeeze ourselves in the kitchen and just chat while my mom or dad cooks.
- Honestly, six months before getting 'Orange Is the New Black,' I remember telling my manager I was done.
- Oh my God, I think I purchased some Jimmy Choos, and they hurt like crazy. That's when I realized that fashion truly isn't about comfort; it's about looking good.
- Even in times of great sadness, there are always moments where we crack up.
- I watched 'House of Cards' in three days - and only in three days because I had other responsibilities, like my daughter. I couldn't just sit there and watch the entire season in just one sitting.
