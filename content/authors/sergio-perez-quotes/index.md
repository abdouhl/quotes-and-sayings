- As a Formula One driver, you dream about winning your first race all your life. I am desperate to know what it feels like.
- Pastor is a driver who doesn't respect other drivers.
- I have to take the positives from 2012 and the negatives as well because you learn more than you do from the positives. It has been a great season last year, a lot of learning, and now it's another approach. The way I will approach this year is totally different, so we are ready to fight for it.
- The facilities are amazing here in McLaren. If you compare them to Sauber, who have good facilities in Formula 1, it's another level. But in terms of the people, the way they approach their jobs, is really amazing when you come into McLaren. The emphasis they have is very good and it gives you a big boost when you drive for this team.
- Everybody who knows Formula 1 knows McLaren and knows that it is the greatest team in Formula 1.
