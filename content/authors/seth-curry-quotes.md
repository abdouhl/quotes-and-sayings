- I want people to see what I can do. Not see what Steph can do or my dad can do and then assume that's what I do. I want them to actually watch me play and then decide who they think I am.
- I'm not really someone who's always out on the scene going places. I'm a homebody. That's just who I am.
- For me, it's just finding ways to create shots. I feel like if I got a shot off, it has a good chance of going in. So it's finding ways of creating different shots. Being smart. I watch film a lot, and different tricks that I can do to get my shot off the ball and creating ways to get shots off of pick-and-rolls or one-on-one situations like that.
- My mentality's always the same, whether it's summer league, D-League, NBA, wherever it is.
- I like having the ball in my hands and being able to make plays, but I think my shooting is an asset, too.
- I didn't want to go to Golden State. I didn't want to go back in Steph's shadow.
- I feel like I've been very underrated and very kind of disrespected so far in my career. I just take the same approach every time out: try to go out there and dominate and be the best player on the court.
- I think basketball IQ, work ethic, competitiveness are probably the most important things in a basketball player.
- I've got a good first step and things of that nature. So it's just about using your body to make the defense play at your tempo and react to you.
- I've heard people say I'm a Curry and that helped me get where I am. Sometimes I think it's the opposite.
