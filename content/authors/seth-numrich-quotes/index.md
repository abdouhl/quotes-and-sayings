- My weakness as an actor is that I think too much.
- I've actually seen a good amount of the shows at Lincoln Center Theater. I went to school right across the street at Juilliard, so some of the first stuff I got to see here in New York was at the Lincoln Center Theater. I've always been inspired by the work that they do.
- When you're home-schooled, you have to have a certain level of work ethic. Otherwise, you don't get anything done.
- A dear friend of mine always brings a pineapple instead of flowers when he comes to a show. I love it.
- I really hope that I can continue to do classical theatre - it's something I am really passionate about and I'd love to explore.
- Math was always hard for me, but my dad would come up with ways of making it fun. I remember playing 'Number Munchers' on our old Mac... That counts as math class, right?
- I'm always interested in storytelling and whatever form that comes in.
- I've played a couple of gay characters onstage, and it's always been something I'm comfortable with. I grew up in a family and a culture that doesn't have stigmas about sexuality.
- Working with Al Pacino was an amazing experience. He's such an amazing guy. He's an incredible performer and actor - and, aside from that, just a generous human being.
- Theatre has been a part of my life since before I can remember - my dad is also an actor and a director and a storyteller who lives and works in the Twin Cities; my mom is a nurse practitioner, but she also grew up doing theatre - so, it has always been a part of my experience.
- During my childhood, I played just about every sport imaginable, which became less feasible at Juilliard... Although I remember our annual dodge-ball game as a highlight. The Juilliard 'Fighting Penguins' are a force to be reckoned with.
- If I could go back to my first year of acting school, I'd probably say: 'Relax. Stop taking yourself so seriously.'
- Boxing is really an art form. It might just look like two people beating each other up, but when you look closer, it's actually quite beautiful and interesting.
- Boxing is a lot of preparation and then improvising, so there are parallels to being an actor.
- Next to acting, being in the great outdoors is my biggest passion.
- I don't think there should be a hierarchy of what is valid in the arts.
- I've gotten pretty good with a tray between acting jobs. In fact, when I got the TV show 'Gravity' I was still doing my catering work. I told my director I had to miss rehearsal because I had to work a party. He was like, 'You're on TV. You need to get over that.'
- If you think you're in shape, try boxing. You'll discover that you are not. It's the most physically challenging thing I've ever attempted, but I love it and I want to keep up some of the training.
- Theater has been my way of learning about everything.
- I have never been able to hold onto a really strict gym regime because I get bored.
- When I was six, someone in my family gave me a yellow pencil holder that had my name printed on it. I still have it, and when I'm doing table work in rehearsal, I use it to carry my highlighters and other writing utensils. I love it.
- Every show you do, you have to do research, and I love to dig into things. I learned about World War II by doing 'Anne Frank.'
- In theater, you get to rehearse several weeks, you memorize everything, and by the time you open, you know what the play is. In film, it's almost the opposite. You do your work on your own and maybe have a couple of minutes to rehearse. When the camera rolls, you generally don't know what's going to happen.
