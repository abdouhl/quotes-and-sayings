- Kangana has started believing in her own myth. She says she taught feminism to the film industry, she taught it nationalism. I'm glad she spelled that out because nobody else had noticed! I think she fears the day when she will no longer be in the headlines and so has to keep making outrageous statements to stay in the news.
- Not belonging to any political party actually helps me because I value my independent voice above everything else, I treasure it.

- I was very nervous about speaking in Punjabi. I have learnt it by heart.
- It's interesting to see how 'Arth' still touches a chord in people's hearts all these years later. Men were very hostile when the film was shown in 1984.

- The position that Indian Muslims have is unique because we exist in a democracy, which is something that cannot be said about many Muslims living in the world.

- What bothers me about red carpet, particularly Cannes, is that it's an extremely important festival where stunning films are shown and nothing of that ever comes in papers. It's always celebrities standing with one hand on waist, I don't know who decided that as an attractive position.
- Until the age of 19, I lived in the Communist Party commune where eight families lived in 180 to 200 square feet of space. In that world, social justice was a given. We grew up valuing that.

It is a systematic campaign to divert attention from real issues, failing economy, China border tensions, spiraling Covid cases, and farmers' agitation by putting the spotlight on the supposed ills of the film industry.
- I don't see the point of having a favorite sari or a favorite outfit if I know that I won't repeat it. I'm glad Kate Middleton has been repeating her outfits and talking about sustainable fashion. Celebrities must set an example and repeat their clothes.
- I think men and women are different - I am not saying better or worse, just different.
- Some people feel that the purpose of cinema is entertainment - which in itself is a healthy enough goal, provided you define what constitutes entertainment.

- I take up films only if I agree with the ultimate message the film conveys.
