- I was not really worried about what people thought of me or how offensive my jokes were. I was just kind of saying whatever I wanted, and that gave me the reputation of being this crazy, loose cannon, you know, psycho guy. It still kind haunts me to this day. Like, 'Oh, Shane Dawson - that guy's nuts.'
- I think Jake Paul doesn't know who I am.
- I want to know the psychology of a YouTuber... do you think, to be a YouTuber, you have to have something off?
- I lost a lot of weight, when I was 18, on Jenny Craig.
- I started pitching shows and sold a show, 'Losin It,' about my Jenny Craig days. It never was made. I think it didn't work, partially because I didn't write it.
- I don't think I'll be doing daily videos forever.
- For the record, I don't really hate myself, but I do hate the way I portray myself online.
- The biggest thing I learned is directors don't make a lot of money on a movie.
- It sounds super cliche, but staying true to yourself and what you are works.
- I have a P.O. Box that I get about 50 letters a day that my mom picks up, and a lot of weird gifts I like to show on my videos.
- YouTube opened up a lot of doors.
- I'm not really gay, and I can't sit here and say that I am, because that's not real and that's not genuine. But I also can't sit here and say that I'm straight. This is something I've come to the conclusion through therapy and from being honest with myself. I am bisexual.
- Anybody could be a sociopath. Anybody.
- I get it, okay? I shouldn't be doing this. I shouldn't be giving Jake Paul a platform.
- People who don't know me are going to be surprised by how much I don't take myself seriously.
- I didn't think I could pull off a novel.
- I love interviewing people and getting them to talk about things they've never talk about.
- For me, it's always fun to have people that do the same thing as you or and have the same work ethic as you. A lot of my friends have YouTube channels, and I use them in my videos, and I'm in their videos.
- I always wished that I was gay, that I was just 100 percent gay - for so many reasons. No. 1, that means I would know who I was. No. 2, it would be a lot easier for me to be accepted by people because I wear wigs and dresses on the Internet, and I'm feminine and all these things. It'd be so much easier to be just like, 'Yeah, I'm gay.' But I'm not.
- I've made a lot of crazy comedy videos and said a lot of crazy things. If it's too offensive, I apologize and move on, but I do comedy.
- Love who you want to love. Life is short. Nobody's going to hate you for it.
- I kind of made the decision early on to be extremely open about everything and just pretend like all of these people watching were my close friends that I could tell stuff to and be honest with.
- If you go through my Instagram feed, it's like a flip book of me thinking I'm way more attractive than I am. It's nauseating.
- Not everybody is either gay or straight.
- There's nothing creepier to me than a student who hangs out with the teachers.
- Make the videos that you want to watch. Don't think about who is going to be upset or offended.
- I'm proud that I don't make crazy jokes anymore.
- I love podcasts, so I thought I'd try one.
- I think I'm used to competition. YouTube is a daily competition. I'm used to that, and I'm used to hate coming from everywhere on the Internet.
- I have kind of a thick skin.
- Being a comedian, it's hard. People hear 'YouTuber,' and they automatically think, 'a social warrior,' and you have to stand up for all these things.
- Online, I'm this loud, outrageous, confident guy who acts like nothing bothers him, and he has the whole world at his fingertips. In reality, I'm a shy, quiet guy who would rather spend his nights lying in bed watching Netflix than being a valuable member of society.
- It's fun to be around people who don't think I'm creepy for making videos in my bedroom on the Internet.
- Now I put up something, and I have to think, 'Oh, there are millions of people watching, and some of them could be affected by the jokes I make.'
- I'm not saying that I don't like the stuff I put out into the world, because I genuinely enjoy my videos and think they are funny. What I'm saying is that I embrace the fact that I have a punchable face, and that if I could punch myself without feeling it, I would.
- The problems you have as a kid will seem ridiculous when you get older because bigger and worse problems will come along.
- I hate when people cheat.
- I thought I'd be on TV and movies - that's what I really wanted - and I can't believe I didn't need to do that. I did it on my own with just me and my camera. That's very, very weird.
- There are a lot of coming out videos of people who are gay or lesbian, and they're so confident. But it made me cry because I'm not that. I don't know who I am 100 percent.
- Howard Stern is one of my idols.
- 'Mad TV' is one of my most favorite shows of all time and is a huge part of my obsession with sketch comedy.
- I've been wanting to do some type of video about the idea that YouTubers have to have some kind of personality disorder, something right, to do what we do. Putting ourselves on camera all the time, being so open on camera all the time, having conventions with our name in it. There has to be something.
- I think competition turns people into what they normally wouldn't be.
- Christina Grimie was one of my favorite people, not only because she was caring, she was humble, and she always felt like people mattered... but because the first thing she said when she met me was, 'Oh em gee - your videos are really gross, but for some reason, I love you.'
- You don't need to figure out exactly who you are right now. Just live your life.
- I was morbidly obese. It was a way for me to create a shell around me so that nobody would look at me.
- The one time I'd ever babysat, the kid ran into a glass door and got a concussion.
- I would tell high school Shane to just start writing down everything that was happening. It was so hard to think back to all those terrible moments. They all started clustering together into one big terrible moment.
- No matter what somebody thinks about your videos or whatever, everyone can agree how much work it is.
- YouTube has a stigma about only kids watching it. That's true. It is mostly kids and teenagers who watch it. But I've never made videos for teenagers. They should not be watching my videos.
- On YouTube, you know, if you say something, you know, that triggers somebody, it becomes a whole controversy, a whole thing - and all the comments and everybody's upset, whereas a book, there's no comment section. There's no - there's nowhere for the audience to, you know, get mad at you for saying something.
- I have spoofed celebrities before, but it's hard for me because I picture them watching it.
- I can honestly say that I am open to love in any way. I guess that makes me bisexual.
- I started making videos when I was, like, seven or eight.
- Everybody loves a Keurig.
- I'm just an innocent guy with a dirty mouth, I guess.
- I'd wanted to be a director since I was five and had been making videos since I was a kid. Then YouTube came around during high school. I was making videos, and it was just a place to put them, like storage.
- Kids can be so mean.
- I know what I do for a living is ridiculous.
