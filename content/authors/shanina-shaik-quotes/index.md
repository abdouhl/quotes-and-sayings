- I'm a big fan of moisturisers and facial serums.
- I actually started modelling when I was about eight years old, and then, when I went to high school, I stopped to concentrate on schoolwork because I was in an accelerated program, so it was just really time for me to sit down and focus on my studies.
- I like doing Zumba. I only do it like, once a week. If I did it more often, I would be very skinny.
- When I was 17, my mum thought it would be a good idea to compete in a modeling television show. It was hard for me to book jobs in Australia at this time, being that my look was so different. Even though I didn't win, I was given a modeling contract with New York Models, so I flew to New York as soon as the show was finished.
- No beauty shines brighter than that of a good heart.
- Bringing exercise bands, ankle weights, and a jump rope is a great way to work out while you're traveling. You can find amazing workout videos online to help with your training.
- I'm pretty healthy, so I eat a lot of vegetables and fish. But I'm a huge sweets fan. It's really bad. I love ice cream and cookies and cake and all that stuff. So on the weekends, I will definitely indulge.
- Being culturally ambiguous and having to deal with bullying made me strong and independent.
- I try to eat mostly vegan.
- I love music and wish I could sing!
- Look after yourself from within, and your beauty will shine through on your skin.
- If I want to do a contour, Tom Ford's Shade and Illuminate is great. It also feels really nice on the skin and looks really natural.
- I do believe that models should be older now. You tell girls to go and catwalk and be sexy, but some of these girls have never even experienced their first kiss, so they don't understand how to be like that.
- Everywhere I go, I travel with Estee Lauder Perfectionist Youth-Infusing Brightening Serum + Concealer, M.A.C. In Extreme Dimension Lash mascara, and Nars' tinted moisturizer.
- I like to do a mix for my workout because I find that when you do the same workout, you get bored of the gym, and also, it's great to shock your body.

- I like to get up every day around 8:30 or 9. If I'm not working, probably around eight.
- I like my natural lip color a lot. So everything that I do with my lips is just trying to find products that enhance it a little.
- Find the foods and workouts that make you feel great. Everyone's different. Find what works for you.
- Vegas is the best place to go out. You can't stay more than two nights, but everything is so big and grand.
- You know how people put toothpaste on breakouts? Same with Vegemite. I've done it before, and it works.
- I really enjoy living in New York, but I don't enjoy the weather so much!
- If I wasn't doing modeling, I'd like to study child psychology.
- I'm actually more confident when I'm tan.
- Manuka honey is really great if you've got a breakout.
