- We've seen a lot of people self-destruct because of a small taste of success.
- We all enjoy the band and what we're doing, but we know this isn't gonna last forever.
- I really enjoy the therapeutic value of writing songs.
- Life isn't a tiptoe through the tulips.
- I think we really almost burnt ourselves out on one record.
- I feel more confident about what we're doing as a band and what we're trying to do as a band and the way we're looking at it as a band.
- I want to do more. I'm never satisfied with what I've done.
- I'm in road-coma at the moment. But it's OK. I think you subliminally become a junkie of being on the road. As much as you think you're burnt out, the minute you get off you go stir crazy and you just wanna go right back.
- You use everything. You use tragedy you use everything.
- I need to start caring about myself if I'm going to be a proper father.
- I know that sounds selfish, but you have to look at what it's doing to you personally - are you frustrated because of the way people perceive you, or are you happy enough about the things you've realized about yourself that you can tolerate the way people perceive you?
- I made a living out of being a class clown.
- I'll close my eyes really, really tight and make you all go away.
- I hate the word 'hippy'. I hate a lot of people, and hippies don't do that!
- You start wanting to see a different place every day.
- There's no leader of this band, and there never will be. That's the key. You can't control how the public perceives you-people see rock'n'roll bands as the guitar player and the singer.
- Keep on dreaming boy, cause when you stop dreamin' it's time to die.
