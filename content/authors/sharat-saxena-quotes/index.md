- Farooque Sahab was so natural. It never seemed as if he was pretending to be a character that a scriptwriter or director had merely handed to him.
- I am doing an interesting film called 'Club 60' where I share the screen with many superb actors like Satish Shah, Farooque Shaikh, Tinu Anand, and some more. It's one film I am looking forward to as it has been made very differently.
- I think comedy suits me best.
- Through our long career we never got to work together until 2013 when we signed 'Club 60.' Until then I always liked him from afar. I knew Farooque Sahab was a decent person, a warm person, but it was only after I met him during this shoot that I realized what an enormously nice and genuine person he was.
- Some actors merely have to appear before the camera and they are able to convey exactly what the director wants.
- I am happy to be part of 'Sajjan Re Phir Jhooth Mat Bolo.' This character is something that I have not done before.
- I remember Farooque Sahab would bring volumes of nice food on set for the whole unit. Not just that, he would send sackfuls of mangoes from his farm in Gujarat.
- I don't understand why youngsters today start hitting gym at an early age. I believe the right age for going to gyms is after 35, when you are neither young, nor old.
- I'll be working till by last breath and would prefer to die on sets only.
- Actors have to entertain viewers, be it on TV or in movies.
- Of course, my children have my full support but they'll have to work hard and prove themselves if they want to make a career in film industry.
