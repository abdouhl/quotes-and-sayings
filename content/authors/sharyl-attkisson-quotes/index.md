- One death is too many - and with careful management and a lot of luck, the coronavirus sweeping the globe will be curbed, in terms of illness and loss of life.

- Many Americans are eagerly watching the devolution of traditional news with relish because they agree with the prevailing narratives, whether based on true facts or imagined fiction.

- The nature of the government's surveillance on me and my family is forensically proven and not subject to legitimate question.
- News organizations would best serve the public by sticking to the facts and the news. Speculation should be minimized.
- And this may be hard to swallow for those deeply embedded in a particular political philosophy, but I think most people - whatever their choices - simply want what's best for themselves, their families and their country. They differ on what that means and the best way to get there.
- As reporters set aside their traditional role as fact seekers and veer into advocacy, they find themselves on a slippery journalistic slope.
- I think very few of us have a thick bold line on every given topic that falls neatly into the box of a chosen political party or figure.
- Each political party in America contains people with a hodgepodge of beliefs. Their given positions on a topic may shift slightly - or drastically - from year to year or day to day.
