- You can make films, and often, they get released on four screens in the U.K. Although it's been interesting and good for you, if no one's seen it, what's the point?
- Don't be losing sleep over tiny things. Life is complicated enough.
- I'm delighted to be working on 'Casualty.' It's a terrific cast and crew, and I'm very grateful for the opportunity.
- It helps to be more interested in other people than you are in yourself. Inhabiting other characters is what I do.
- It's good for a story to have a strong style.
- I think it's a falsehood to think you can have some kind of plan. Acting isn't like that, it's more vocational, I think.

- In Liverpool, where I live, we have a brilliant library which has been refurbished, and I like going there.

- I've been dumped plenty of times, I can assure you of that.
- As a kid, I was always more interested in watching others than being the centre of attention. I've always felt that you can see a lot more and learn a lot more when you're standing on the edge.
- I think it's important to live your life the way you want to live it. Don't live your life in fear.
- If I can be dead honest with you, when I first see the script for a new episode of 'Endeavour,' if anything jars, I say, 'What's this? Has it got a place in our story?' And if it hasn't, it has to go.
- Acting is an amazing job. I'm very lucky to do it, and when you're working with terrific people, telling stories you care about, and know it reaches an audience who care about it, too, there is an escapism in that.
- While I try and give as much energy, enthusiasm and detail to any work I do, if I keep coming back to it, to the same people year after year, there's an attachment. But you don't want anything to become comfortable.
- I don't really think of myself as the sporty type. But I'll have a go at anything.
- If you put too much pressure on the idea of people watching you, it stops you being able to watch people.

- I think the trick is to leave before everyone is sick of you!
- I think it is OK to surprise people.
- I watch Channel 4 News every day. I love it. I rarely watch any other news programme. There's just something about it - and I'm not talking about Jon Snow's ties and socks, but I appreciate those, too.
- I'm a big reader. And I take a lot of pictures, do a lot of writing.
- I don't think you can work properly if you have anxiety about something; it stops you doing the work you're paid to do.
- With all due respect, I have a job to do, and that is to try and make 'Endeavour' the best it can be.
- I used to have an aunty who read tea leaves. She was incredibly accurate.
- I think when you're in the middle of a piece of work, there are things that bleed over into your life. You're spending a large portion of your day pretending to be somebody else, to tell somebody else's story.
