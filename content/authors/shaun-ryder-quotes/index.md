- The problem stems from the ADHD. The nutty behavior. You have got all this energy going and you can't focus on anything. It's like games at school - like football. I couldn't play because I couldn't understand the rules. I couldn't get offside. I just couldn't take in the rules.

- I've had a few alien encounters.
- It never bothers me playing huge venues; it's not personal, is it?

- Wives and girlfriends really shouldn't be anywhere near the band. Not at all. Anyone who's listening to their girlfriend, they shouldn't be involved. All bands have Yoko Onos, and the Mondays were no exception.

- My dad loves it - being onstage - but I don't.
