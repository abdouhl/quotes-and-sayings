- We definitely have our finger on the pulse. You have to keep up. We decide what to watch by what's funny.
- Women don't like advice. They don't want you to fix their problems, they just want you to listen.

- I knew when I was 6. I just knew it; I didn't care about nothing else. If I didn't make it in this world, I would probably be homeless. I gave myself that little to fall back on.
