- I'm a method writer. In order to write about the emotion, I have to experience it. I get physically tired and exhausted, devoting hours and hours and hours to it.
- In high school I dated a white woman. She would come to visit me on the rez. And her dad, who was very racist, didn't like that at all. And he told her one time, 'You shouldn't go on the rez if you're white because Indians have a lot of anger in their heart.'
- I had the feeling I was going to be successful, and I didn't want to be another disappointing Indian.

- The people who loved me when I was seven years old love my books, and the people who didn't like me when I was seven years old don't like my books.
- There isn't a lot of poverty literature in the young-adult world. And I don't know why that is, but I think certainly I felt a gap.
- All art is exploitation.
- I think that white women are more apt to read laterally. So I think there's some strong identification for women, and their political and social positions, and minorities. I think that the political power of, let's say, the average Indian man and a white woman are pretty equal.

- The problem is that too many adults think their kids' lives are simple, or they try to make their lives simple, when their emotional lives are just as complicated as ours. They might have a few less tools to deal with it because they're young, but the emotions are all the same, and the subject matter is all the same.
- When you read a piece of writing that you admire, send a note of thanks to the author.
- My wife was the first romantic partner who understood both American and native parts of me - not so much the positive stuff, but the damage.
- We all know the Indians were colonized by the Europeans, but every colonized Indian has been colonized by the Indian reaction to colonization.

- I look more Indian when I'm serious.
- What inspires a poem for me is usually a moment.
- I grew up in a storytelling culture, a tribal culture, but also in an American storytelling culture.
- Certainly I'm angry at the way Indians have been treated and continue to be treated. But I don't think it's a helpless emotion.
- I was a controversial figure on my reservation when I was a kid. I was mouthy and opinionated and arrogant. Nothing has changed.
- My career means, if you're a non-Indian writing about Indians, at least there's one Indian in your rearview mirror.
- My father was sleepless most of his life. So by the age of five, I was awake with him all night long, watching bad television or we'd lie in the same bed, and I'd read my comic books while he read his latest spy or mystery novel.
- I don't know what any individual should do about crossing her own borders. I only know that I live a happier, more adventurous life, by crossing borders.
- I don't think there's a whole lot of class literature at all. I think most of that has become racially based, and people don't think of it as being class literature.
- I think a lot of Indians want Indian artists to be cultural cheerleaders rather than cultural investigators.
- All I owe the world is my art.
- You want the good life? You live where white people live, you go to school where white people go to school, and you shop where white people shop.

- My father was always depressed. When he was home and sober, he was mostly in his room.
- Sixty percent of all Indians live in urban areas, but nobody's writing about them. They're really an underrepresented population, and the ironic thing is very, very few of those we call Native American writers actually grew up on reservations, and yet most of their work is about reservations.
- I thought I'd been condescended to as an Indian - that was nothing compared to the condescension for writing young adult literature.
