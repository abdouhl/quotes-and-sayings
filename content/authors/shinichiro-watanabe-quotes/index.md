- With 'Space Dandy,' you've obviously got your image of the space and 80s music, and blending them together is how I created it.
- Some people compare Spike Spiegel to Dirty Harry, and they're both antiheroes. But Spike is an extension of myself.
- I loved 'The Matrix,' so when they asked me to do some animation relating to it, I was thrilled.
- Usually, the things that are quickly slapped together become the big hits, rather than the ones you would painstakingly deliberate on.
- I wanted to have lots of characters in 'Bebop' without white skin, and if people weren't used to that, well, maybe it would even make them think a little bit about it.
- Lots of times when you watch anime, the characters all have white skin - all the characters in fantasy stories all have white skin, which I never liked.
- I believe samurai in the Edo period and modern hip-hop artists have something in common. Rappers open the way to their future with one microphone; samurai decided their fate with one sword.
- When I was very young, even before I went to what you call elementary school, I used to read and watch Japanese comic books and anime all the time. These were the seeds of my future.
- When it was released in the 80s in Japan, 'Blade Runner' was actually a series that influenced the Japanese media very much so. I assume that everyone in the anime industry has seen Blade Runner at some point.
- I feel like I want to make anime that destroys the norms, something that would be strong, even if it is unconventional.
- The anime that inspired me the most and one that I probably have influence from is the very first series of 'Lupin the 3rd.' I'm very drawn to 'Enter the Dragon' and 'Dirty Harry,' too. They definitely inspire me.
- When creating 'Cowboy Bebop,' I thought it would be more interesting if I added different types of elements together to create something that was completely new.
- After I began in elementary school, I was able to go to the movies, and that was how I would spend my weekends, watching several movies one after another and almost all of them American movies. This is how I fell in love, at so young an age, with American movies and culture.
- When you're making anime, if you get all of your inspiration from anime... it's going to lack originality and creativity, so I try to get my inspiration from different genres.
- In 'Space Dandy,' I'm trying to challenge myself and do stuff I haven't done before. I'm aiming for a really funny, cool, and crazy creation.
- I've been interested in hip-hop since it first appeared: the fact that it was born not in the music industry but on the street, the idea of using a turntable as an instrument, singing vividly about reality instead of typical love songs, and its links to graffiti and dance.
- The work that has influenced me the most in my anime profession would be, of course, 'Blade Runner.'
- I was influenced by American movies of the '60s and '70s, especially Don Siegel's 'Dirty Harry' and the films of Sam Peckinpah. And, of course, a lot of the film noir movies of the '40s.
- National borders have always been arbitrarily drawn by people, and in ancient times there was a lot of exchange of people and culture with the continent.
