- Both my mother's younger sisters, Padmini and Tejaswini, are actresses. I am extremely close to Teju mausi, as I am quite similar to her. We both are adventurous, spontaneous, childish, impulsive, and a bit silly and have our own strange sense of humour.
- It is amazing to sing in front of a live audience. It is incredible. The energy is awesome.
- I was shocked and thrilled when I started getting messages and calls from people I look up to in the industry.
- I want to do something that people have not seen before... surprise everyone. There has to be variety in work.
- Intimate scenes or a kiss is a very technical aspect of filmmaking. It is extremely mechanical.
- I use the products I endorse. For instance, I always carry the new Lakme Lip Love that I launched, and if you come home, there is one on my bedside table, too.
- I am a Mumbaichi mulgi.
- I used to trust people easily, but now I'm a little careful because some experiences have taught me to not trust anyone blindly.
- My style statement is to be myself! Because if you try to imitate someone else, you will end up feeling uncomfortable.
- When you know someone, and you get to work with them, automatically there is this comfort zone which comes in.
- I wasn't a friendly child. I was reserved and mostly kept to myself. My family tells me they've noticed a sea change in me after I've grown up. But I guess that's natural. Your surroundings, friends, college, etc. do make a lot of difference to your personality.
- When you are writing something that is false and presenting it as a fact without confirming... I feel it's extremely wrong.
- My father has acted in over 700 films. My mother acted in one film, 'Kismat with Mithun Chakraborty,' in which my father also had a role. My father fell in love with her and would drive her around in his sports car, and they subsequently got married. My mom is the most beautiful woman and I think she has taken some serum to look young all her life.
- Acting is something I've always loved and enjoyed.
- I'm never happy with the work I put in. No. I need to be told by my director and people around me that it is fine. Otherwise, I'll even go, like, 'One more take.'
- I know competition is there, and it can come my way by new, fresh faces that are around or are coming up. It pushes me to work hard. I know if I don't work hard, I will be left behind. So, I continue to work hard.
- I want to keep bettering myself as an actor and singer.
- Now I am also friendly with people who are not so nice to me. From what I've learnt, it's nice to be friendly. It's nice to make people feel good about themselves.
- My first film was a big dud at the box office, and my second film did decently. I used to wonder how it would feel to have a hit film. I thought I'd be larger than life, but I'm not feeling anything I imagined. It's a completely different experience.
- I went through a brief phase when I thought of other career options: being an air hostess and even a psychologist. But eventually, my destiny led me to acting. Moreover, my dad being an actor, I have grown up in a very filmi environment. I was encouraged to watch films since I was a child.
- I am a mix of both old classic romance and modern. I think it is up to what suits the two people in love best!
- I have shot four films for sure. On most days, I wish that there were 48 hours in a day. When a movie is coming to an end and another is going to start, I've felt that I don't want to let go of this one just yet and say goodbye to the character nicely.
- Lack of etiquette and manners is a huge turn off. Men who don't behave decently are irritating. Also, I don't like guys who show off. When will guys realize that girls hate showoffs!
- My last couple of films, 'ABCD 2' and 'Rock On 2,' didn't do as well as expected. It affected me quite a bit, but then easier said than done, I had to stop thinking about it and continue doing what I love doing best!
- I completely agree that a sound sleep is the best beauty product. Sound sleep, one of the most important but underrated thing, helps to make you more beautiful. I can never understand how people work so hard that they miss out on their sleep.
- I think that people should really understand what it takes to make a film.
- I think broccoli is one of the must-have foods, as it contains multi nutrients and is high in vitamin C. Sweet potatoes are rich in complex carbohydrates, and fish, too, is healthy. There is nothing that I have on a daily basis, as it becomes monotonous.
- From when I can remember, I wanted to be an actress. I am a die hard fan of dancing and would take my dad's clothes and my mom's clothes and dance in front of the mirror. I loved my dad's clothes, as they had a lot of glitter in them.
- I always wanted to do something different with each film. So I guess that means that I wanted to not repeat myself. There has to be some kind of a new element in each project that I take up.
- After the success of 'Aashiqui 2', I feel I need to conquer a lot more. I am constantly working towards it, and I will work harder.
- Aditya Chopra is my mentor and one of my favorite directors.
- After 'Aashiqui 2,' I have been receiving congratulatory calls and messages from people, and they are showering me with praises. I am happy that the film connected with the hearts of the masses.
