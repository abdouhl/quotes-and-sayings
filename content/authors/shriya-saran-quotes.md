- To be honest, I think it's a fair argument to ask actors not to endorse fairness products. We don't need to be fair in this country, and there's a whole lot of madness about being fair. Many advertisements are projected in a manner that if you aren't fair, you don't get married - and when you get fairer with the creams, you do!

- I've never met a human being like Rajinikanth sir. Every time he walks in, there is this aura around him. He is very humble, gentle and sweet to spot boys, light men and gives the same amount of respect to everyone. What I enjoy about him is his sense of humour. He is highly knowledgeable and can be mostly seen with a book in his hand.

- In Hollywood, an Angelina Jolie is paid a fee that is probably at par with her male colleagues, but we can't expect the same here in India. Universally, films have meatier roles for men. Most films are about male protagonists and their histrionics on screen; women are signed up for song sequences and to up the glam quotient.
