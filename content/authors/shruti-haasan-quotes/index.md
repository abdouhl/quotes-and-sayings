- Eventually, the outcome of a film is not in my hands. What I do while making the film is in my hands, and that is what translates onto the screen.
- I am neither a method actor nor a trained one. So, I don't generally prepare for any role. Becoming the character and being in that moment are most important.
- There is an unrealistic pressure to perform like Kamal Haasan, and it's unnatural, because he's been in the industry for so many years, I don't even take the comparisons seriously.
- Any film that can entertain and has a message and cannot be slotted into any genre is unique.
- Though the characters I have played are all very different, they are all strong, interesting women.
