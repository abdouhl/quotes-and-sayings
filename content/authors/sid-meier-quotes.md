- Our approach to making games is to find the fun first and then use the technology to enhance the fun.
- Dinosaurs was a cool idea, but we just couldn't find a way to make it really fun. We've got a bunch of great game ideas that we want to bring to life over the next several years.
- We'd love to do Pirates for the 21st century. People have also asked about Colonization, and a few others.
- Our hope is to deliver an incredibly fun and compelling game that will give the fans more than what they've been waiting for, and show a whole new generation of gamers how much fun it is to live the life of a pirate!
- Right now we're working on finishing up Pirates! for the Xbox, we're developing Civilization IV and we've got a couple other games in development that we'll tell you about soon.
- I love Age of Empires and I play RTS games all the time, I respect what they've accomplished.
- I think computing power is ready to do 3D justice. It was great for shooters and racing games in the past, but I didn't think it was right for strategy games.
- I like some shooters, and I respect games like Doom, but I don't think it's right for me.
- It may be that other developers are finding that their games play better on one platform over the other, so they're choosing to migrate to that platform.
- The new Pirates! builds on that legacy delivering an even more powerful and fun experience to players... and is still unmatched in offering a blend of genres in one great game.
- Our goal has been to stay true to what people most love about the original Pirates! while upgrading, enhancing, and in some cases, re-inventing the game to make it a great experience for today's gamers.
- We think we've got it taken care of now. Multiplayer is something that's hard to do in a turn-based game, especially a turn-based game that lasts a long time, like Civilization.
