- I'm lucky that I'm inside the fashion industry and see clothes from a different perspective than the traditional consumer. Being able to curate, edit, and style product to make my own look is a privilege, but something I think men are becoming more aware of how to do.
- The biggest criticism would be buying clothes that are too big or trying too hard. I tend to like things a little leaner and more formfitting. I believe personal style often outweighs fashion. Just be yourself.
- I'll always be a Brit abroad, and I love London so much, but New York is my home.
- People can take away your assets, but not your DNA.
- Spring 2010 is the second season that I'm showing the double-breasted suit. I think the right double-breasted suit is young again.
- The whole process of being one of the 10 finalists for the 'Vogue' Fashion Fund award has to be my biggest achievement to date. Meeting Anna Wintour, Diane von Furstenberg, etc., has been an amazing experience that even now gives me goose bumps when I think about it.
- Even though it's not a widely appreciated yarn, any suit made from a mohair-wool blend travels exceptionally well. The retention of the mohair fiber bounces back and minimizes any creasing that occurs whilst traveling. Mohair also breathes really well, keeping you cool or warm, and is therefore extremely versatile.
- The biggest thing I'm seeing - and I have to be careful what I say here - is that people are tired of the old guard and the familiar brands. They're looking for more individuality and creativity, and that's coming out of this whole new wave of younger brands: Thom Browne, Michael Bastian, Robert Geller, myself.
- If you are already familiar with a brand, buying online is fast, convenient, and probably the way forward.
- Everyone that knows me already know that I rarely stray from my black jeans, black T-shirt and a black jacket - tailored or leather. I like to have a uniform and one that's versatile. I'm a very hands-on Creative Director, and I need to feel comfortable and be able to move between both casual and more formal attire at the same time.
- I personally like to shop in person so I can feel the product.
- I think the success of any brand reboot is to acknowledge the heritage but to embrace and interpret it in a way that makes it relevant and wearable to the modern consumer.
