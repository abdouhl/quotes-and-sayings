- The way I approach my insecurities is by making sure I'm the first person laughing at myself.

- I found it was way more fun to build useless stuff.
- I didn't know how to necessarily make good robots and I was scared of failing to make good robots, so I thought I might as well make bad robots to kind of alleviate the pressure of that.
- I don't want to be brain tumor girl. I don't want this to be my thing.

- I build a robot version of Jenna Marbles' dog, Kermit. It turned out a little bit worse than I had anticipated.
- When I build for YouTube, there isn't necessarily an end goal. I have an idea of how I want a thing to work, but if it doesn't work that way, I can always adapt the story. The story is the main driver, not the machine.
- Pretty much all of my inventions come about the same way. I have an everyday problem or something that I'm too lazy to do, so I make a machine that does it for me.
- I'm good at pitching my weaknesses as strengths.
- My top video is probably the wake up machine. And that one was the first one that started going really viral. It's an alarm clock that slaps you in the face with a rubber arm.

- I wanted to see if I could make a living off of having fun.

- I love Sugru like I love duct tape. I basically just compensated for lack of building skills with Sugru.
- I set out to make a sandwich using a robot arm. I put a knife at the end of it and tried to make it spread peanut butter over bread. It didn't work so great.
- I'm still sometimes convinced that I'm just making all of this up and I'm actually somewhere drooling in a straight jacket. This success is such a bizarre thing.
- I got one comment that I had a lot of double chins. I just laughed at it. I do have a double chin, so that's legit.

- I really dislike soup, especially pumpkin soup.
- I'm not an engineer. I did not study engineering in school. But I was a super ambitious student growing up.
- I really wish this wasn't a thing. But this tumor is a thing. Even though it's not what I would have chosen for myself, that doesn't necessarily mean it has to be all bad. What I keep trying to remind myself is this is one of those things that looks like a really bad thing on the outside but I know too little about life to be sure.
- Finding a better way is all I do.

- As for making video comedy, pretty much anyone can do it. When I got started, I just filmed it with my webcam and used iMovie to edit the video, which I still use.
- My learning process has always been very idea-oriented. I never sat down with a book being like, 'OK, now I'm going to learn about transistors.' Instead I had an idea that I really liked and learned as I was trying to figure out how to build it.
- I live on an old tugboat but feel that having a submarine would be the next level.
- Getting slapped in the face with a plastic arm to wake up is not as painful as it might look - probably more humiliating than painful really.
- I wanted to automate any part of my life that I could. And the over-the-top solutions are more fun than the useful ones.

- I'm kind of a challenge junkie, I think.
- Career wise, I'm looking into different opportunities to do a TV show, but in some way that's not a goal in itself. To me, the goal is creating content and doing fun stuff that I'm proud to show. I don't want to do a TV show for the sake of doing it.

- Haircuts are never good. You always end up being unhappy.
- Having the brain tumor, coming out of surgery and going through all of that, you're like, I am never going to feel the same and I have this new perspective on life.

- The wake up machine was actually pretty painful after some time.
- There's an incredible amount of people that you can compare yourself with and be like, why am I not doing as well as that person? It's really hard.
