- I really never saw an obstacle for me in taking leadership positions because, in a very ridiculous way, I thought, 'If Mary Robinson can do it then why can't I?'
- Having to re-articulate your values and, most importantly, your rights, is something that can be quite tiring and frustrating. However, I am meticulous and tenacious and will continue to do so, because I believe it's what's right. I believe it's what I should be doing.
- For so long, the fashion industry has designed almost exclusively for a particular woman with particular measurements, and they've never really been challenged on it. We're all consumers, yet we're rarely given a voice within this industry that dictates what we wear.
- People often ask me when I realised that I was different. Some people seem surprised that it's a question that I cannot answer. I was never told that I was different. I was always just Sinead; I was just like my dad.
- I was fortunate and worked hard to graduate top of my class as a primary school teacher and receive the Vere Foster Award, which is the medal given to the graduate who attains the highest mark in teaching practice.
- My height was not a deterrent, and it did not make me the person I am. It was like my long brown hair or my brown eyes - a physical characteristic that differentiated me from quite a percentage of the population.
- Using a public bathroom is an incredibly embarrassing experience. I enter the stall but can't reach the lock on the door.
- Listening sounds like a ridiculous characteristic for mentoring, but genuinely being invested and interested in people, meeting them for cups of coffee and spending time with people, and using the network I've been very lucky to build up to help others are all things I do to help others.
- The word 'midget' is a slur. It evolved from P. T. Barnum's era of circuses and freak shows. Society has evolved. So should our vocabulary. Language is a powerful tool. It does not just name our society. It shapes it.
- I was born with the genetic condition called 'achondroplasia,' which I inherited from my dad: my mam is average height, and my dad is also a little person. I am the oldest of five children, and I am the only one who is a little person.
- Hate crime and hate speech must not be tolerated. Our policy and lawmakers and those who uphold the law must protect the most vulnerable in our society.
- With the rise of social media, it has given me an opportunity and a platform to have a voice as a blogger and as an activist, but it has also made me nervous that I might become a meme or a viral sensation, all without my consent.
- I want garments that reflect my personality. It's difficult to find in the childrenswear department. And often, womenswear requires far too many alterations. I want shoes that affect my maturity, professionalism, and sophistication. Instead, I'm offered sneakers with Velcro straps and light-up shoes.
- Disability is articulated as a struggle, an unnecessary burden that one must overcome to the soundtrack of a string crescendo. But disabled lives are multi-faceted - brimming with personality, pride, ambition, love, empathy, and wit.
- My siblings, along with my parents Chris and Kath, are the reason that I am successful. Whether I wanted to become an elementary school teacher, enter and win Alternative Miss Ireland, enroll to do a Ph.D., or visit the White House to speak about fashion and disability, they supported me.
- Clothes are not a frivolous subject, and the conversation around them should not be belittled. How we dress affects what we feel, what we do, and who we are.
- Looking at how things might be under Trump is scary, particularly when a pinnacle moment in his campaign saw him mocking and belittling a reporter with a disability.
- If somebody, without knowing me, comes up to me and wants to upset or belittle me, I think that reflects badly on them, not me... if you're ever unsure of what to call me or someone like me, my name always does well.
- When people learn that I'm a qualified primary school teacher, I'm often met with surprise and a list of questions, including, 'How do the children react? How do you do it?' Children are some of the most open and inclusive individuals. It's often us adults who have difficulties in accepting difference.
- I often forget that I'm a little person. It's the physical environment and society that remind me.
