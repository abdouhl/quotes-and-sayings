- I have followers because of my dad. I get asked about his movies once a week. They want to know how he stays in shape and if he writes the screenplays.
- Pre-workout I will have 1 cup of oatmeal and post-workout I will make a Greek yogurt parfait.
- I loved fashion, ever since I was a little girl, which I know sounds cliche, but it is true.
- I love Topshop and live in its crop tops and jackets.
- My sisters and I, we haven't done much, but there are already fake social media pages for us!
- My mom was a model and she would show me her old books, and it was so cool. She would tell me everything there is to know about the business - the good, the bad, the ugly.
- I'm hoping to dive into the producing aspect of this industry. I don't want to limit myself to just one thing, so I kind of want to dip my toe in every field and see what clicks with me.
- I inherited my dad's sense of humor and work ethic.
- Christmas Day we get all the dogs and the cats and make breakfast and open presents and then go to the backyard - because it is always like 100 degrees in L.A. - and we get a speaker and play fun '80s music and dance outside with all the animals.
- Even if I delete something, I know somebody probably will have a screen shot. I portray myself how I want people to view me.
- I keep my opinions to myself. I'm neutral - like Switzerland.
- We always throw a Christmas Eve party, and then we do a whole matching pajama thing.
- My normal thing was going to premieres and walking red carpets.
- We were very athletic growing up. My dad basically trained us like boys when we were little, so being able to physically challenge myself and to be able to do crazy stunts and not use my stunt double was super exciting for me.
- Fans can be a little crazy. Sometimes they go too far by pretending that they're you.
- My parents would love to keep me near. They're protective, and they want their little girl home, but I feel that a smart move would be for me to go to college in New York and continue modeling there.
- I still think acting is something that you're born with and I think the greatest actors today, they don't need training, it comes naturally to them. It's like being a naturally good singer... I don't think that's me at all.
