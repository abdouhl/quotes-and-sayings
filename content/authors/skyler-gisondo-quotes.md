- My favorite part of making a movie is to watch it in a crowd of people seeing it for the first time.
- Although I love working and making movies and that will always be the priority, I really do love continuing my education. It's great to be active and learning instead of sitting around waiting for a phone call for the next project.
- It's so much fun to be able to collaborate creatively with someone you grew up watching.

- Acting is always the priority and I love doing what I do, but I'm also very interested in directing and writing and getting a hand in every part of the movie making process.
- I'm starting at USC's film school for directing this month. I'll try to get a semester in at a time. I'll have to take time off for work throughout school, but it will be nice to get through a little bit.
