- Guitars are like women. You'll never get them totally right.
- You know, when you really connect with the instrument and everything just comes out on an emotional level very naturally through your playing. That's, you know, a great night.

- And, as soon as I could put together the, you know, three or four notes that made up, like, sort of a rock and roll lick, you know, like a Chuck Berry kind of thing, I was off and running. Just completely taken over.
- Guitar is the best form of self-expression I know. Everything else, and I'm just sort of tripping around, trying to figure my way through life.
- I always loved rock guitar. I just never put it together that that's what I'd end up doing.
- As for Guns N' Roses, I don't think there's ever a chance of a reunion.
- I think when I was a kid, and I was in England and it was all about The Stones, The Who, The Kinks and The Beatles and that's what my dad was into.
- Risk isn't a word in my vocabulary. It's my very existence.
