- Whenever I finish a movie, I usually go through a period where I think I'll never have another idea. And then, somehow, you get another idea.
- That's the way I work: I try to imagine what I would like to see.
- A lot of young filmmakers bring their movies to my dad because he always gives lots of good editing ideas and notes. He'd be a good film professor.
- I wanted to make a love story without being nerdy.
- I got exposed to so many different cultures and people.
- Of course I am proud of my dad and where I come from, but I do have my own way of working my own style.
- I never studied directing and I never really thought about doing it, and then I just found myself in that situation and tried it. I like to be observing everything else, and I get self-conscious in front of the camera.
- I definitely have had friendships and moments with people from different backgrounds and in different stages of their lives.
- My mom is very calm and quiet, so I think I got that from her. Because my dad is passionate and loud... It was always interesting, and I really enjoyed that my parents always included us in their lives.
- I had a teacher when I was in college, and he was the first person who liked my photos and said, 'The way you look at girls is your own way of seeing.' He was the first person who really gave me the confidence to try something.
- Everyone in my family is in the film business; I knew I wanted to be creative and it was important in my family to be artistic.
- Acting isn't for me. I don't like being told what to do. I'm more interested in set design, more visually driven.
- I work with my brother a lot, and we don't fight - probably because it's not two girls. And he's six years older. But I have daughters who are three years apart, and they fight all the time.
- We were always around my dad, so he wasn't absentee at all. I don't think it was normal, but it was exciting. You always had lots of creative people around, and my parents took us everywhere.
- I try to just make what I want to make or what I would want to see. I try not to think about the audience too much.
- With writing, I need a lot of time to sit around and do nothing. But now that I have kids, I just don't have that luxury. I have a babysitter for three hours a day, which is how long I have to write.
- I'm always a sucker for a love story.
- There's so many more female directors than when I started. That's encouraging.
- For everyone, there are those moments when you have great days with someone you wouldn't expect to. Then you have to go back to your real lives, but it makes an impression on you.
- It seems that the greatest difficulty is to find the end. Don't try to find it, it's there already.
