- Fifa urgently needs a fresh start and transparency is key. Moving its headquarters is the only way the association will attract new people, many of whom are likely to have long lost faith with Fifa's ability to govern.
- I believe if I was white I would've been England captain for more than 10 years.
- Young players have to realise pretty quickly that it is not about one game, but how you perform over the whole season.
- I think the FA wished I was white. I had the credibility, performance-wise, to be captain. I was consistently in the heart of the defence and I was a club captain early on my career.
- I love managing characters. Characters make teams and I believe I can deal with all sorts. The most important thing is being able to pass my knowledge on to others and allowing them to flourish as individuals and as part of a team with a specific strategy.
- Sometimes I am the 'philosophical professor, or I can do the voice like thunder if necessary... or if I want to keep the lads on their toes I might sit back and give them a thousand-yard stare.
- If people don't like you, people don't like you. It's as simple as that.
- People like to put people in little boxes and if you don't fit you're odd. But they don't really know anything about me.
- At the time, when I was growing up,my habits were misconstrued as laziness, not caring. But when I got out onto the pitch I actually did care about football, I just showed it in a different way.
- Fifa has lost the trust of the people. We cannot allow the architects and controllers of world football to get away with dragging the beautiful game through the grime of corruption and bribery.

- For too long executive officials, businesspeople and hangers-on have enjoyed this private casino, using the payments into Fifa's account to fund their lavish lifestyles.
- Politics is very hard work. You have to really commit to things. Some people get into it for the wrong reasons.
- I've not had a massive PR machine. I'm just a normal guy. I work hard. I like players who hate losing. That's who I am.
- I think in the end football wins hopefully, and people start looking at all scenarios. In the end I just want to be a manager. Forget whatever colour you are - that's the way it should be really.
- Coaching is definitely different. I've got the knowledge but it's about communicating that to others in a manner they can understand. There's an art to that and the more you practise, the better you get.
- I am a naturally big guy, but I cannot rush my conditioning, otherwise trying too much too quickly could result in injuries.
- People may think that I just want to manage in the Premier League but I'm prepared to go to a non-league club, and if they can't pay me a salary just pay me a win bonus. I'm up for that.
- Look at France and Didier Deschamps; he was just a guy who just did his job but he was captain of one of France's most successful teams. Then you've got Iker Casillas; he's not into PR or things like that, but he's one of the most successful captains of Spain.
- Every case is different, but what I want to do first and foremost at Southend is to get the players up to speed.
- I've been abroad, I've been at home. I've even flown 10 hours away for an interview, so I've done a lot of miles. I should probably be an ambassador for British Airways.
- Look, I'm an entrepreneur, I want to create things, I'm a builder. I don't want handouts. If I didn't play football I'd be doing something else. That's me. I don't want to be held back. I want to go forward. I want to better myself.
- I've done it the correct way with the coaching badges. I have done watching the games, I have done listening to managers, I have done travelling around Europe watching other managers train, I have done a bit of TV work to help with analysis.
- Going with England and the Under-21s was great for me.
- Once you start realising where you are, then you can start realising what you have to do to get the best results.
- I am going to fight on the pitch for Newcastle and if it comes to the stage where someone says can you fight for England then I will fight for England. But I am not going to go on about it. It is just not worth it.
- Training-wise, you have to work on your weaknesses, preparing yourself properly for the game, on and off the field.
- As long as I do a good job and do it professionally and people see the quality, and see who I really am, then I think that's all you can do in football.
- I don't want to sit by the edge, like some other guys who have played their game. Earned money, have nice lifestyles, and don't say anything.
- Michael Owen was made a captain ahead of me.
- We all like a party but when that 'becomes the main feature of your lifestyle as a footballer, I haven't got time for that.
- I think that what London wants are people with ideas and the willpower to get things through.
- My parents worked hard. My mother, Wilhelmina, was a very strong woman. She had to be with 12 kids. She would do anything for the family. She was a light, the glue in the family.
- The main thing is when you make mistakes, you try to learn from them.
- I could have started playing professional at 16, 17 quite easily. For my position, I was far better than a lot of people around me. All the people in front of me had was experience but, talent-wise, I easily could get in.
- I'm a doer and I just want to do it. Whatever attitudes, prejudices, stereotypical ideas that are in front of me, I will break them. But the only way I can break them is by getting a job, and if I need to start in the gutter, I will start in the gutter and work my way up. Money isn't an issue.
- If you have got diversity on your board, then you are going to have new ideas come to the table.
- Fifa would benefit hugely from the experience of former players from a variety of backgrounds including Africa and Asia. There aren't many senior staff who have played at the top level and the organisation needs balance.
- When I left Spurs I was one of the best defenders in the world and had done so much for such a long time with ultimately little reward. I practically kept the club up on my own for two years.
- Most of my players have come through academies with clubs. That's not a bad thing, but it's very different to what I grew up with.
- The career I have had should warrant me getting a job. I've done all the badges. I'm doing my coaching badges with the Welsh FA.
- I'm a street footballer and you still get street footballers from Africa, South Africa and really poor parts of Europe.
- There are things that are not in your control and you will never be able to control them. You've got to accept that very quickly.
- I come from a working class background, it wasn't easy for me at all, but I worked hard.
- But sport is about character. It is about understanding how a team works, about pushing the team. I also wanted to do it because of where I am from as a human being. That's what London people want: thinking outside the box, new ideas.
- With the Tube, it just needs more investment. Maybe lengthening some of the platforms to get more carriages in, things like that. It just needs more investment put into it.

- With Newcastle there are 50,000 people watching and they want it to be a success, and that is what I am all about.
- I'm from Stratford, East London. I can get down and dirty. I just roll my sleeves up and get on with it.
- If football covers all your emotions, that's too shallow for me.
- I'm a street footballer. I'm hardcore. Growing up in east London, you've got to be a little bit self-confident. As a player, I would go into detail, watch who I was playing against. Who might come into my vicinity. That gives you self-confidence.
- I became insular because at home there was no space to grow or to evolve, everything was tight and there was no room to breathe. People don't realise how that affects you as a kid. I wasn't allowed to speak, so my expression was football.
- If you win, you have to get your feet straight back on the ground and grind out another win. You can enjoy the moment, but remain level-headed and always think ahead to the next challenge.
- A lack of street footballers dulls the imagination, dulls that natural thinking outside the box. You need that on the street when you're 9 and have to beat a 14-year-old on the dribble. Or if you get knocked out and have to sit on the side and come on.
- You have to truly believe in your skill and trust that you can do something.
- The main thing is to have strings to your bow. You get your badges, you see where life is, and then you see what things come your way, if any.
- A hotel is so restrictive. You haven't got your own space. Yes you get the food, yes you get everything all clean and blah, blah - but sometimes it's nice to have your own space with the your family.
- You can be yourself and still have fun without crossing the line. Sometimes I feel like today's players don't want to do anything! Come on, be yourself! That's what people want.
- My wife's family kept inviting me to shoot and I just didn't want to go, but since retiring from football I've had more time and I thought... let's get all the kit and practice.
- I'm used to having strong women around me. My mother was. My wife is. I like their strong mentality.
- We can't all have gleaming grass, cut to the millimetre, perfectly manicured and watered when needed and looked after by 10 groundsmen. Not everyone can be at these clubs.
- The passion is still there, you can try and walk away from football but it just keeps on coming back.
- It's all right to have black captains and mixed-race in the under-18s and under-21s, but not for the full national side. There is a ceiling and although no one has ever said it, I believe it's made of glass.
- I have the tools to climb the mountain so I don't mind climbing mountains. I have climbed mountains since I was growing up in east London in Plaistow. I'm not scared of climbing mountains. When you get to the top, the view's great. That's what it's all about.
- I have all sorts of country clothing because we live in Northumberland as well as London. You need good quality gear.
- Don't change being you, because it's hard work being something that you're not.

- My first medal, the League Cup at Tottenham, that was a very proud moment for me. Being captain, and winning. But also winning the double in my first year at Arsenal, that was special.
- Most footballers are quite tense, aren't they? So many footballers have been stitched up over the years. They've got to mind what they say, be careful about this, careful about that, because something might be misconstrued, twisted around.
- I don't rely on off-shore tax havens, and I don't want to invest in stocks and shares as we have seen how volatile that game has been since the financial crash.
- As a player I was taught the importance of working four or five passes within your team and then stretching the play. That's something I believe in strongly as a coach.
- I don't want to be pigeon-holed as a firefighter.
- But when you look at some of the other guys who have started with their careers in management, they all started with no experience. You have got to start somewhere.
- That's the thing with top players, the higher you go up, the more you want. You want to push your body, push your mind, push what you want to get out of that particular season.
- Football is always moving and you've got to keep up with it.
- My values are in my DNA and were shaped by my environment.
- If I don't impress you in an interview then fine, but at least give me that chance. That's all I want; to talk to a chairman or owner about my philosophy and what I can do for their team.
- The only pictures you saw of me when I was playing, I was crashing into a centre forward! Or running down a line to save my team. I'm not gonna be happy, be smiling.
- I saw a lot of stuff growing up as a young kid that I don't want my kids seeing.
- Every time I have gotten into anything, I have wanted to do it well. I've always been like that as a young boy, every time I've wanted to go on that pitch.
- My message is simple to all the knockers: I am knuckling down and want to play my football with a great club and a great manager. Then you can judge me.
- I like to be a tiger roaming the jungle or an eagle soaring the skies.
- I've got my own mind, and I'll talk about it, but I'm willing to listen. I'm very balanced like that. If you don't want a guy who's balanced, who wants to win, and can bring people together well... I don't know.
- Yes, I was a footballer, but there's more to me than meets the eye. I've got more levels. So many levels. I'm not going away - and I'm going to keep on talking until things start changing.
- If you get an opportunity, you get an opportunity, but it really comes down to the people behind the scenes and the manager. You can't do anything about it.
- Some players can just act like 'whatever' off the field and then play amazing. Not many, but some. I just wasn't wired like that.
- When someone intelligent comes around, and looks at life around football in a different way, it can be alien.
- I like building teams and I want to run my own show, in the nicest possible way, to see how far I can go, starting with getting Macclesfield further up the table.
- Some people need safety nets. Some people need two safety nets. I've grown up with no safety nets around me.
- Sometimes you get a team that has almost forgotten how to win. That's maybe fallen away from the standards that should be set at this level. Some are big problems, some of them are small problems.
- I learned a lot from Arsene Wenger, especially his tactical systems and how to plan things game to game, week to week and month to month.
- People have to recognise I'm a working-class lad. Forget what I've done and where I've been. I'm a working-class lad. I've come from nothing and I've not forgotten that.
- I've got a furniture range with my wife, and I want to get into designing hotels and restaurants as well. We've got a big studio in Victoria and a showroom in Belgravia. I've always been interested in architecture.
