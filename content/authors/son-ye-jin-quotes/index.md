- I was never a good student. But I wrote acting notes every day and prepared for my next shoots diligently.
- I think my eyes are pretty, but I'm not sure with other parts.
- When I got the script for 'The Art of Seduction,' I realised I'd never been in a comedy, so I decided to experiment. What the character went through could never happen in my own life.
- I used to be very shy. I hated going to a new classroom and having to make new friends, meet new teachers, and adjust to a new environment.
- The box office isn't something I consider. If I do, I can't really work.
- I hope I don't get too old before I can get married.
- I'd like the audience to see different sides of me.
- When I first started out, all I thought about was my own acting.
- Why is it so difficult to have films seeing the world from women's perspective like 'Thelma and Louise?'
- I exercise, and eat good foods. I also take care of my skin.
- In order to date, you need to make up your mind to date, meet many people, and have blind dates offered to you, but that's not easy. It's more difficult as you get older. I don't think it's possible to do something by force, either.
- It's always agonising to separate my life as an actress and personal life. Just because I'm happy with my acting life doesn't mean I'm happy with my personal life. I'm always making an effort to balance between the two.
- I've starred in many melodramas, but the reason 'Something in the Rain' is so special to me is that I feel like I'm living in reality.
- I think part of maturity as an actress comes from their experience in getting married and having children.
- I didn't understand at first why I couldn't meet a guy for so long. But as time goes by, I understood why actresses usually get married late. I think their hearts for work become bigger and happiness from the work takes the most space in their hearts.
- I usually get out of my roles easily when dramas end.
- I think it's important to widen my artistic repertoire.
- I like someone that I can actually talk to. I used to like quiet guys, but now, I like gentle and well-caring guys.
- I'm able to look the person acting across from me and respond to that. There are times when it becomes so lonely and painful, but I think I'm able to overcome them because I realize that the more fiercely you prepare for a role, the more the audience can feel it.
- Being a mother and wife are big roles.
