- I think using anti-aging products really helps; the sooner the better, you know?
- I cry if something bad happens. I grab a drink with friends when I get stressed out. I travel. I sometimes lash out at my closest friends.
- The dramas that I worked on were successful, but not the movies. I still have many opportunities, and I will not be discouraged.

- I love to travel, so I visit a lot of places.
- In 'The Grandmaster,' I had a supporting role, but my character in 'The Crossing' is much more central to the plot.

- When I think that I'm the only actor from South Korea to have worked with John Woo, it's really humbling.
- The only difference is that I'm a celebrity, and I'm shown to the world. Apart from that, I think I'm like most women my age.
- When I was younger, I liked guys who had a good personality and decent looks.
- If I had to name one thing that differentiates me from the other women, it's that I get free stuff at restaurants or get discounts.
- Regardless of the success of a drama or film, I will be satisfied if viewers say that my acting has progressed and has gained more depth.
- Playing Mo-yeon was satisfying because I could be irritable. I normally can't be like that in public because of my image.
- I personally think that it is acceptable if I take a step forward and can act with more diverse expressions and feelings.
- Honestly, I do not care about my age.
- Song Joong-ki is known for his sincerity and manners. He is younger than me, but I thought I learned many things from him.
- When I'm not doing a project or working, I also eat and sleep at home in my comfy clothes.
- In my late teens and early 20s, I worked hard on my roles, but, to be honest, I didn't feel any special commitment to acting.
- Sometimes I think, 'I need to get married soon.' Other days I think, 'Why get married?'
- I await a project where I'd have to deeply invest my emotions in.
- I don't usually paint a big picture on what I'll do in the future.
- To keep the skin moist throughout my travels, and within a tight schedule, moisture care is necessary. And skin ageing originates from dry skin. So before I go to bed, I use my Laneige Perfect Renew Regenerator, and sometimes, I use Water Bank Essence, too.
- I usually fly abroad to shoot films and for interviews, so I spend a lot of time inside planes, and I feel that my skin gets very dry.
- People assume that I'm girly. But people who know me say I'm more boyish.
- In most professions, you build up confidence and a sense of achievement as you go along, but that's really not true for acting.
- There are so many talented actresses in Korea right now, but they're not seen because there aren't roles in which they can show their talents.
- Just like how male actors get to play varied characters, I would also like to play characters that people don't normally see female characters portraying on screen.
- With more and more stress from work, at times I really do hope to have someone I can lean upon.
- Some days I think, 'I have to get married soon,' but other days I think there's no need to get married when I'm enjoying life while doing something I love.
- I don't find it uncomfortable that I'm recognized and liked by so many people. If that were hard for me, I wouldn't be doing this work. Rather, I think I'd be more sad when a day come when people don't recognize me.
- It would be good to rely on the man during my most tired moments. The best is if he will listen to my stories when I am stressed.
- To me, age is not that important.
- My mother told me it's better to start using anti-aging products even at a young age. Especially since I'm an actress, and I'm constantly under stage lights or exposed to a lot of sunlight.
