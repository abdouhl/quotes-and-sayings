- I don't like to talk about things till someone asks about them.
- I had directed a short film called 'Girvhi' earlier, on child labour. It was a fictional story. At that time, I realised I could direct a film if given a chance.
- I am not the kind of person who won't get married because of my career, because there was nothing great happening in my career anyway.
- I don't think one ever stops struggling.
- I've never had it easy. There have been fortunate coincidences and instances, but nothing has fallen into my lap. Whatever I've achieved has always been through sheer hard work.
- I think every content can reach its potential audience if placed rightfully.
- I think TV, at times, is incredibly regressive, but I guess with the way few people are ready to experiment, the progressive streak has slowly crept in.
- The entertainment industry is always targeted at young people. Understandably so, as they are the key consumers. The young are the ones who are falling in love, starting out in life; older people aren't. Nobody thinks, 'Now I'm going to write a film about an older person.'
- I was not nervous while making 'Nazar' because I was well prepared. I took three months to prepare. When I went on the sets, I knew what I was doing.
- Like every mother, I also want Alia and Shaheen to be happy. Whatever they do, they should feel satisfied doing it. I'm not a paranoid mother who pushes them to settle down.
- Not much changed post-'Raazi.' I didn't get too many offers.
- Alia was a very obedient child. The only thing she was fussy about was what dress she wore. I would have to give her choices, and she would pick her dress out knowing very well exactly what she wanted to wear.
- I am one of those people who cannot sit idle at home; I would get depressed. I have a constant hunger to create and to learn.
- People are lazy when they cast. It's natural to think of the most obvious fit to your character.
- Alia needs a full support system that I'm happy to provide her.
- I don't know what kept us together. Initially, both of us were hotheaded, so we would end up fighting a lot. But there was a lot of love and respect, too, I guess. I believe that's the key to a successful marriage.
- I was a complete anomaly in this business. I didn't fit into the Hema Malini-Zeenat Aman commercial cinema mould, neither the Shabana Azmi-Smita Patil art cinema mould.
- My acting, writing, performance - keep me on my toes.
- Compared to Alia, it's little more difficult for Shaheen, as she has a famous father and a famous sibling, too. So, I always tell my daughters to not to pay much heed to these expectations and give more importance to their dreams. They should keep working hard and find their own talent.
- I am the mother, and the emotional chord with my children is naturally strong. So there are times when I might get sleepless nights because I am worried.
- I am very political in my mind, thoughts, and understanding.
- I didn't want to be a sex symbol. That was perhaps my mistake, but you can't really change who you are.
- I frankly don't watch TV shows that much.
- In 'Yours Truly,' I was the centre of the story; I was the protagonist. There was a lot more happening inside the mind of the character which was not projected loudly through dialogue and action... As a performer, playing such a nuanced, internal character is challenging.
- People opposing dance bars claim that a lot of money is wasted in bars. I want to ask them why not target five star hotels, too, where a lot of money is spent?
- If you are not willing to grow together, then the relationship will not survive.
- I would have never thought when I was a young actor that I would want to direct.
- To be honest, nobody was running after me with roles, so there also came a time when I did neglect the acting side and was keen on directing and pursuing that. People got this impression, 'She's directing, not acting,' stuff like that.
- Alia doesn't need my guidance regarding the kind of films she should do. Rather, she is quite a sorted individual who follows a strong instinct. And this seems to have worked in her favour.
- I feel, if I criticize my country, it's not because I don't like my country. I love my country. That is my patriotism. I want to make it a better place for my children, for everyone. And if we don't look at what's in front of us, and we allow things to get out of hand because of other vested interests, then as citizens are not doing a good job.
- Every company should have zero tolerance on sexual harassment so that victims feel secure while taking a stand.
- I was a struggling actor all my life.
- It is easy to say that if such harassment happens, walk out of your job. But people depend on that job. It is about their livelihood, a question of survival. So while we must encourage victims for coming up with their #MeToo stories, we should not judge women for not sharing their stories.
- A filmmaker is in a very vulnerable position when their films are releasing.
- Later in life, I learnt that in order to deal with people, one has to be gentle and give them respect. That always works.
- You cannot control the spending habits of people. It is a free society, after all, and people should have right to spend their money as they wish.
- I am very much of an Indian by heart.
- Being half Kashmiri, it's always special for me to shoot in the valley and to be there with the locals. They are all very warm people who are very hospitable and genteel and always welcome everyone with an open heart.
- You come to a certain age in life and wonder, 'I am holding back for what?' Why not just say it?
- Presumably, with age, you mellow down.
- Actresses do glamorous roles, and then, after 10 films, they do an offbeat one. But Alia didn't do that. She picked films like 'Highway' and 'Udta Punjab,' too.
- In this country, if a woman wants to work, she has very little choice. After you cross the age suitable for a heroine, there is nothing in the middle; the next thing you do is you become a mother.
- My mother is a German who was brought up in the U.K. So, there is so much cross-cultural exposure I had as a child. But Mumbai is my city.
- Between my two girls, Alia showed a natural flair for acting.
- I did not bring up my child to think that she was a star. If I had treated her any differently, it would have messed everything up. She was brought up normally, like other kids, in a normal house, and it was a normal, middle-class life.
- I have done a lot of things apart from acting, probably because acting was not very consistent in my life.
- You never really stop learning. You have to experiment and reinvent life to sustain your interest.
- I probably marketed myself all wrong. I had exotic looks; I should have done those glamorous roles that exuded 'oomph.' But in my head, I was always an actress first.
- There is nothing wrong in playing parts in a good film.
- I do believe that actors have responsibilities.
- It's tough for a child to deal with expectations that people have if they have a successful parent. A child often fails to cope with the same and constantly tries to find out possible ways to excel - just to live up to the name.
- I'm an actress. I'm ready to work anytime.
- Forget being an actor-director: we, as citizens, have the responsibility to make the country a better place. And that doesn't mean advertising other people's agendas; it means looking at what is wrong and making it right.
- A doctor's son can become a doctor, and no one screams nepotism. I don't understand why, in this industry, people keep saying 'Nepotism, nepotism.'
- It is always wonderful to have a theatrical release; lot of filmmakers desire that.
- There will always be people who will first wait for somebody's comment and then attack them. I'll say they are just cowards. They have no opinions of their own. It's very easy to be a sheep; it's not easy to be a shepherd. One should not give a damn about these trolls. One should not give them importance at all.
- Struggle is always very demoralising. It's not a romantic phase in anybody's life. It's very difficult. What it does is, it brings out your creativity in different way.
- It makes the city unique and hold a charm. In old Kolkata, there are some beautiful old buildings... some of them are well-maintained; somewhere reflects what the city has gone through in the past.
- Our artistes should be allowed to go to Pakistan just as we welcome their artistes.
- My passion is my driving force.
- Nepotism is a natural thing that happens in every field.
- When television emerged, it opened up many avenues for actors like me, but after a point, it also became very limiting.
- It was a miracle that I became an actress. I survived because of hard work and perseverance.
- Alia and Shaheen have a smart father and have got good genes. But it's not fair that people expect them to do as well as their father.
- Kolkata does not look like a Delhi or Mumbai. The city has its identity.
- I never needed anyone when I became an actress. I ran off to England on my own.
- People should see my work and think beyond what I am on daily basis, on Twitter, Instagram, or the perception they have of me in their heads.
- Two single, young souls can fall in love. What's the big deal? Rather, it's a good thing.
- I wanted to work in the Hindi film industry much more than what I was offered. But if you are a grain of rice in a wheat field, it is not your fault... You are just different.
- When someone is humiliating and harassing a woman, he must be knowing that the victim is needy and left with no option but to tolerate such harassment to save the job.
- Acting is a fair business. If you are not going to bring in the audience, no nepotism will work.
- I never stopped working when I got married and had kids. I did television and always tried to do what I could do.
- I enjoy watching news and lifestyle channels. Cooking shows are also my favourite. I also watch a lot of films on Netflix.
- I believe in living life organically, taking it as it comes.
- For a woman, there is a complete dearth of roles to do. Abroad, you really have good roles, and by good roles, I don't mean the film has to be women oriented. I wouldn't mind playing a well-written, small role.
- As you grow older, you start looking at the bigger picture. You don't look at only yourself.
- I was really a very ambitious young girl when I started studying drama and performing art.
- Those who belong to the film families may have a certain advantage, but nobody can keep you in this business if you don't deserve it.
- I am a mother. Whether it is Alia or Shaheen, at any point in time, if they are suffering, I am the one who gets affected badly.
- Whenever you go to Kashmir, you find people who are very gentle and soft-spoken.
- In this business, you can't make any plans.
- As her mother, I am always there, but Alia knows what she wants both professionally and personally.
- I always set small goals and work towards them to achieve them.
- Everyone is different, and each has to create his or her own path, irrespective of who their parents are.
- The digital space is becoming more relevant, and people are watching a lot of stuff on the web.
- I am as curious about my daughter's acting debut as the rest of the world. I think Alia has got the best possible debut under the biggest banner. But it's not going to be easy for her to go from the first to the second film smoothly.
- Acting, according to me, gets better with time and age. The more experiences you have in life, the more you have seen, the better equipped you are to deal with complexity and bring out the depth in characters.
- I am a very private person.
- I have always been known as Mahesh Bhatt's wife, and I would tell people, 'Hello! I'm here!' This has always been a struggle. I would like to be known for who I am. I'm very happy to be known as his wife or Alia's mother. But I am also a person who, in her own right, has gone through quite a lot of odds.
