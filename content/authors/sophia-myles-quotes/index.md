- I don't want to be known for anything other than the fact that I play characters in movies.
- I've spent a lot of time in L.A. and I love it. A lot of Brits can't stand the place, but I like the West Coast attitude and the way people celebrate success.
- The culture of celebrity has become insane. It's all based on fantasy, and I find it creepy and disturbing.
- I've always been really ambitious, whatever I do. At school, I always wanted to be the best in the class - no, it wasn't enough to be the best in the class, I'd want to be the best in the country.
- I'm very grateful that I have one of those faces that seems to blend back into the crowd. A lot of people pay lip service to wanting a normal life, but it's actually very important to me.
- If you were to do a line-up of past suitors, it's definitely a very eclectic group, is all I'll say.
- I couldn't care less about walking down the red carpet in a pair of heels and a posh frock. I'd rather be in my pyjamas at home.
- I've chosen not to talk about my really private life to the press - I've never invited a huge amount of attention.
- I'm really a strong advocate of ageing because the messages that the media and advertising give to women infuriate me: ie that it's a bad thing to get old.
- I'm half-Welsh, half-Russian. My maternal grandmother is Russian. I've very much a mongrel, which is good in a way because it makes me quite a blank canvas.
- Because I never set out to be an actress, I always feel so lucky and grateful. There are so many people who are really desperate to be stars, and it was completely the opposite for me - I fell into it.
- What I do for a living means that people look at me. As an actress, you are scrutinized. You are not just dealing with your looks privately, you are on display. I have never been 100 percent comfortable in my own skin. I go through different phases. But I don't feel beautiful all the time, no.
- I am spiritual but not massively religious, and I don't go to church. If someone said 'What religion are you?' I would say 'Christian.' But I don't practice.
- I would love to do a really cool romantic comedy, perhaps with Hugh Grant. I think he is brilliant. That's the kind of film I love to go to see. I love 'girls' films'.
- You can get a bit bored of finding out about yourself. I know nothing about politics, for instance. There's nothing that's stopped me picking up a newspaper in the past, and it's something I really should start to do.
- I don't want to be famous. I like to be able to sit in a cafe and watch the world go by and observe people.
- I know so many acting careers that are deliberately kickstarted by a publicist placing a bit of rubbish in a newspaper. And I don't want that. If someone recognises me, I want it to be because they've seen me in something, not because they have seen me at something.
