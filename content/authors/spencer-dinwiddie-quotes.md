- So basically my, my foundation does this thing called gap coverage for, you know, students that apply for our scholarship program. What it means, it's not like quote, unquote 'full scholarship.' They apply for financial aid and, and FAFSA and things like that. Then whatever's not covered, my foundation covers.
- If I had been healthy and projected in the top 20 and then fell into the second round I'd have been hurt. But I knew that possibility was likely and I was ready.
- I'm a real mellow guy, for the most part - yeah, no, not with Kobe. By far my favorite player of all time. His career was basically my childhood.
- The NBA is a job. Just like any other job complaining about opportunity doesn't solve anything. The only thing you can do is control what you can control, and when you are at peace with the work you put in then you don't have any regrets and that's truly the main thing about this journey.
- Look at KD and Kyrie, and they're going to be ball-dominant. You've got to really recognize that and get the ball where it needs to go.
- I've worn a lot of different roles for this team - off the bench, starting, closer, point, off the ball, whatever it may be. So, that's kind of how I view myself - the multi-purpose utility guy who helps keep the guys together, trying to make the sacrifice plays to help the team win.
- If you really want to go after something, you have to keep hammering at the stone whether or not the first hit or the 100th hit breaks the stone. You've got to believe that the stone is going to break.
- When you're out there and you finally get to play extended minutes and you do well, it reaffirms your confidence.
- People still find themselves four or five years out of the league and needing money, and that's because you establish a lifestyle you can't keep up with. Guys don't want to decrease to a $10,000 a month lifestyle when they've been used to $75,000.

- Turning cash flows from contracts of professional athletes into securities is now possible through the power of blockchain.
- I try to be pragmatic.

- I don't really search for typical or more traditional validation because of the role that I've had and understanding what that kind of means in the scope of things.
- With Kyrie and KD, if you're telling me I get to come out here and pass to two phenomenal scorers and get 10 assists a game and maybe be in second gear a lot of times with my scoring, I'm fine.

- Transparency and liquidity make sense in my head, so that's why I have an affinity for blockchain as a whole.
- Being in New York as a whole, Brooklyn as well, you can do anything you want. That's by far the best part about New York, besides just the hustle and grit and grind of Brooklyn specifically, but the best food.

- My role is my role.
- I experienced the G League in two forms: one as an assignment player, and then one of actually being in the G League after I got cut by the Bulls. Obviously, both situations are different. You actually sort of still get treated like an NBA player when you're on assignment. When you're in G League on contract, you're down there for real.
- Nobody gets to the league and is awful. Some people are more built to be good in this than others, right, but at the end of the day, when people are like, 'Yo, you got great overnight,' I'm like, 'That doesn't really make too much sense.'
- First, I'm a basketball player and I try to have the most well-rounded game possible. But people forget when I was recruited out of high school, I was recruited as a passer.
- Super Saiyan' is a term from 'Dragonball Z,' the most important TV show ever. The main character, Goku, is a member of the alien race known as Saiyans.

- Even if I'm the worst player in the NBA, I'm one of the best players in the world.

- Obviously white privilege is a thing, 1000%.
- If I hit a game-winning shot, right, and I run back down the court and shake my teammates hands, it's because I expected to make it. Because I've practiced or I feel I've worked harder than everybody else. So why would I then go nuts, go crazy if I expected to do that? People don't understand that part about me.
- I used to draw shoes as a kid.
- I never got in this to be a 3rd PG, or a backup. Nor did I get into this for money.

- Having a kid, it really puts a lot of things in perspective, and really kind of shows you what love is, and what it should be and what impact it should have on your life.

- The player option allows me to, hopefully, sign a lucrative deal in my prime, before retirement. If you're in a situation where you've played to a level where you can make more money, then you opt out and you make more money. And if you play really poorly, then you opt in and take the money that's scheduled to be on that piece of paper.
- We need more flexibility and ownership over the value we bring to the league.
- My job is to help the team win games to the best of my ability.
- Just like basketball, MMA is all about taking what you're given and exploiting it as much as possible. Strength and stamina are important, but a clear mind might be your biggest asset. Of course, keeping a clear mind while someone twists your arm behind your head isn't all that easy.

- To feel forgotten about after averaging 20 points a game is an interesting experience. But it's a lot better than feeling forgotten about and averaging four points a game.
- All the cliche stuff that everybody says but doesn't necessarily take to heart, that's honestly all you can do. All you have to do is put your best foot forward every time you get on the floor and stay ready and hopefully have the blessing of staying healthy and take advantage of the opportunities when you get them.
- Traditional solutions as they stand are designed to aid the centralized party. That's how it always has been. It will continue to be for the near future. As we evolve and we continue to gain more power and understanding, centralized bodies die down because there's more power to the individual.
- I wanted to have a shoe as a professional, and that sparked that creativity and thought process of what that could be like if I could have my own.
