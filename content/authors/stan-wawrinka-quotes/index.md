- The only plan is trying to push myself the maximum to be the best player I can.

- I like my easy life at home. I like to live in Switzerland. I like to be with my wife, with my daughter, to take my daughter to school, to lead a normal life. I try everything possible to keep that.
- When I was younger, I was a little bit fat. I wasn't, like, big-time fat; I was just overweight - maybe around when I was 13 or 14. At that time, I wasn't practicing that much; tennis was just a hobby. But it wasn't easy to feel that way.
