- Every serious deflation I've looked at is preceded by an asset bubble, and then it bursts.
- If you're early on in your career and they give you a choice between a great mentor or higher pay, take the mentor every time. It's not even close. And don't even think about leaving that mentor until your learning curve peaks.
- If machines do everything well, including allocating capital and resources efficiently, can that be deflationary, can that eliminate poverty? I don't know. It's hard to be very optimistic if you look at how humans have behaved historically.
- I don't really like hedging. To me, if something needs to be hedged, you shouldn't have a position in it.
- I like putting all my eggs in one basket and then watching the basket very carefully.
- There's just nothing to me so invaluable in my business, but in many businesses, as great mentors.
- Whenever I see a stock market explode, six to 12 months later you are in a full blown recovery.
- The way you create deflation is you create an asset bubble.
- Carried interest... you're making money on somebody else's capital. It's not on your own. If that's not income, I don't know what is.

- If you're extremely confident, taking a loss doesn't bother you.
- Soros has taught me that when you have tremendous conviction on a trade, you have to go for the jugular. It takes courage to be a pig. It takes courage to ride a profit with huge leverage.
- Bitcoin is like anything else: it's worth what people are willing to pay for it.
- I have given myself a Tesla for my 60th birthday.
- I think old people like Hillary Clinton and I shouldn't try and be cool with social networks, you know; maybe she should leave that stuff up to Chelsea.
- I don't put Tesla in the Amazon category. They have not proved to me that, as a financial model and an economic model, it is going to work.
- The few times that Soros has ever criticized me was when I was really right on a market and didn't maximize the opportunity.
- Good debt growth is when you borrow money, and it goes into the real economy. You do capital spending. You build businesses.
- I believe that good investors are successful not because of their IQ, but because they have an investing discipline. But, what is more disciplined than a machine? A well-researched machine can make many average investors redundant, leaving behind only the really good human investors with exceptional intuition and skill.
- What a company's been earning doesn't mean anything. What you have to look at is what people think it's going to earn. If you can see something in two years is going to be entirely different than the conventional wisdom, that's how you make money.
- I love Amazon.
- You can be far more aggressive when you're making good profits.
- With my business, the way you make big money is you find a great management team and a good concept, and you stick to it, and you add to it over time. In philanthropy, there was more this idea that once an idea was formulated, you moved along.
- Soros is the best loss taker I've ever seen. He doesn't care whether he wins or loses on a trade. If a trade doesn't work, he's confident enough about his ability to win on other trades that he can easily walk away from the position.
- I've always loved to play games, and face it: investing is one big game. You need to be decisive, open-minded, flexible and competitive.

- I don't like the repeal of the estate tax.
- The first thing I heard when I got in the business - not from my mentor - was, 'Bulls make money, bears make money, and pigs get slaughtered.' I'm here to tell you I was a pig. And I strongly believe the only way to make long-term returns in our business that are superior is by being a pig.
- In my experience, the more successful an idea is, the easier it is to fund it. In philanthropy, it's almost harder.
- Part of my advantage is that my strength is economic forecasting, but that only works in free markets, when markets are smarter than people. That's how I started. I watched the stock market, how equities reacted to change in levels of economic activity, and I could understand how price signals worked and how to forecast them.
- Once an economy reaches a certain level of acceleration... the Fed is no longer with you... The Fed, instead of trying to get the economy moving, reverts to acting like the central bankers they are and starts worrying about inflation and things getting too hot.
- I think Bezos is incredible.
- Earnings don't move the overall market; it's the Federal Reserve Board... focus on the central banks, and focus on the movement of liquidity... most people in the market are looking for earnings and conventional measures. It's liquidity that moves markets.
- For 30 years I've been responsible for managing client money, and it's been a joy, but at some point I need to move on. Thirty years is enough.
