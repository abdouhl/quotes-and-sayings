- Yes! I am big comic book geek. I can't live without them.
- In my career, I have done more than a thousand voice-overs in commercials, cartoons, and radio shows, so I'm very familiar of my voice capabilities and its range.
- I've filmed before in the U.S. and have more than 80 roles in TV, film, and theatre, but the feeling of becoming a part of the Marvel Universe as Colossus is incredible. Sometimes you just can't explain that moment, but when you think about it, you feel so happy and proud.
- It's great finding a comic book character that doesn't care about following traditional comic book rules by breaking the fourth wall and being explicit about everything. This gives Deadpool the arrogance which you just have to love.
- Colossus' voice is not much different than mine, as Tim loved my natural color and range of voice, so we kept it and worked more on the Russian accent. The best note I received was to be authentic.
- As you have two more huge characters as Cable and Domino, 'Deadpool' is growing, and it's making 'X-Force' franchise bigger and bigger.
- Giving the voice and expressions to a character is giving it a soul.
- Deadpool was always one of my favorite characters because of the way he handles all kinds of situations. His style and humor make him the perfect antihero.
- Being a superhero was my biggest childhood dream, but for a long time, I was thinking that a perfect role for me in the Marvel Universe is Sergei Kravinoff, a.k.a. Kraven the Hunter.
- I'm a big fan of 'Deadpool,' and Rob Liefeld masterpieces are among the other great comic creators and characters.
- There is no actor in the world with such talent and charm that could play Deadpool as well as Ryan Reynolds. Working with him was a fantastic experience, and his ideas and suggestions helped me out a lot. It was just great fun to work one-on-one as Deadpool and Colossus.
- I worked with many directors in my life, but Tim Miller is definitely my favorite. He not only has a beautiful sense of directing actors, but he also shares a great love and passion for the comic book world, as I do.
- Becoming a part of the Marvel Universe was my childhood dream. Like most kids growing up, I read a lot of comic books and acted out some of the characters with friends. Since I can remember, I wanted to be a superhero, so it's not just a movie for me - or just another role - it's a fulfillment of my dreams on so many levels.
- X-Force was made like a brutal X-Men club - they're doing special forces, R-rated things.
- As a fanboy, I was raised on the Marvel Universe, so I was very familiar with the 'Deadpool' world. On the other side, the 'X-Men' comics were one of my top five comics, so to be one of them, especially Colossus, is an incredible thing after years of creatively visualizing him since I was a kid.
- My grandfather bought me my first Marvel comic book when I was six years old, and since then, it has been an ongoing love. It was an 'X-Men' comic book.
- Tim Miller's idea of Colossus was to be bigger and stronger than everyone else, so for the motion capture, they needed an extremely tall man. I'm 6-foot-4, but he wanted Colossus to be over 7 feet, so they used a stunt double to recreate his height, and he did very good job there.
