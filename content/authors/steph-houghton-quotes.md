- We've got to make sure we keep the media attention on us; being on telly and in the papers gets people interested.
- I think that's vitally important, that we get players playing at a younger age group.
- It is a bit surreal when I'm out and people are having a look or staring or wanting selfies.
- I think that what's happening is that girls are enjoying playing. It's a lot more acceptable, and now we have a Women's Super League with hugely dedicated female role models - really committed players who people can see are dedicated and training as hard if not harder than any male players - that's all progressing the sport.
- For women's football in this country, it's important we do play in the best stadiums, and for me, Wembley is the best in this country.
- I've been playing semi-professional football since I was 14, really.
- With the likes of social media and outside influences - we're going to be on telly a lot more - I think it's important that you listen to the right people, whether it's your team-mates, your parents, or your coaches, and don't take too much to heart.
- The captaincy is about putting the team first, making sure the girls are happy - that they're comfortable with the processes we have, the way that the schedule is - to be able to challenge people on and off the pitch: not telling them off, but advising them.
- At Arsenal, we train for about two hours a day and are treated just the same as the men. It makes a big difference, and it gives young girls something to aim for.

- Games don't come much bigger than playing the title holders with the chance to win the trophy yourselves.
- Serena is an icon of women's sport.
- I have to keep performing well for club and country. That's what I always want to do. If I do that, then that extra media attention comes towards me.

- I don't practise indirect free-kicks, but the technique and how I strike the ball I practise a lot.
- As a full-time athlete, you put your body through a lot. A foam roller works like a self-massage to roll out the knots in your quads, your hamstrings, and your back so that you feel looser and more prepared.
- I'm a very motivated person, and that goes hand in hand with being very organised. I always plan what I need to do to get the best out of every day.
- Michael Owen's wonder goal against Argentina in 1998 was one defining memory, and as a Sunderland supporter, I remember crying my eyes out after they lost that play-off final against Charlton. Much as that hurt, it made me realise how much I wanted to play the game.
- My all-time hero for Sunderland was Kevin Phillips. He was the one I looked up to.
- The image of women's football has definitely changed. Now we've got to make sure it keeps developing.
- Since the World Cup in 2015, we've all experienced an increase in the interest in women's football, which has led to more and more fans supporting the team.
- If we, as a group, can change people's view from thinking they're watching football as opposed to women's football, then I think we've been successful.
- We've got two semi-professional leagues; we've got many other leagues, more coaching opportunities for youngsters. You never had that when I was younger. You had to go and join in with the boys - that helped me as a player, but I think girls feel more confident playing with other girls of the same age.
- I want to be the best professional and the greatest role model I can be.
- Anything can happen in a cup final; that's what everybody likes about them.

- You get the best out of the girls when they're enjoying themselves, when they've got a smile on their face - they're working hard on the training pitch, but they're allowed to relax off it as well.
- We've all had meetings with the referees. We're all clear with how VAR works, and ultimately, you want the rules to be fair.

- We'd love to be playing to five or six thousand.

- When I was named captain under Mark Sampson, there were a lot of questions about whether I was ready for it. I wasn't a certain starter. There were more experienced players than me; I was only 25. I was trying to nail down a centre-half spot, and it was a difficult situation.

- The women's game has grown, but when I was playing at Arsenal, I don't think people realised how good we actually were. I think there's just a perception that we just play football, but we're not very good, and it was a challenge for us to try and prove those type of people wrong.
- The Olympics is one of the memories that will always be with me. It changed my life for the better.
- Playing with the boys made me a better footballer. It made me more competitive and made me want to win even more. You were playing against the boys and wanted to prove how good you were.

- We hope girls are inspired to start playing at a younger age and try to get to a World Cup themselves.
- I'm a professional footballer, and I get paid for doing my job.
- The support of our fans is vital to everything that we do - we always play for our country and our fans.
- We've had to pay to play. We've had to borrow kit. We've had to train on a Friday night. Maybe a lot of boys, given that opportunity, would slip away, whereas we've had the mentality to go, 'I really want this. I'm going to show that I can do this.'
- My mum was very determined and motivated and always wanted the best for us. That rubs off on you.
