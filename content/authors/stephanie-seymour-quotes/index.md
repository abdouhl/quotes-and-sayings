- I prefer my body after I've had kids to before. I like a womanly, shapely figure. I'm more secure as a woman. I know who I am.
- Grooming is 10 times more important than makeup. I use a hair gloss with a teeny bit of color in it that makes my hair very shiny.
- I wanted to be Brooke Shields, and my mother was an aspiring photographer, so I was, of course, the only one who would sit still long enough for her to get things in focus, and I loved doing that.
- I decide what character I am. I allow myself to become another person. Because if I'm just Stephanie, I'm not comfortable. When I have to jump and do all these things, I feel so silly, but if you become someone else, it's okay.
- I always wanted to be a mommy.
- I love living with animals. And my children love animals. I love walking around and being with the horses. But the deer? They're naughty.
