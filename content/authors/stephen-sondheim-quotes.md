- When you know your cast well and their strengths and weaknesses, you can start writing for them, just the way Shakespeare wrote for his actors.
- There's something inimical about the camera and song.
- Every single song I've ever written is sung by a character created by somebody else. Some might have a jaundiced view of love, some don't. But none of these songs is me singing - not a single one.
- I certainly wanted my name in lights. I wanted my name on a marquee. I wanted recognition on Broadway.
- I prefer neurotic people. I like to hear rumblings beneath the surface.
- Everyone I used to play with has either given up or is dead.
- Nowadays, there are sometimes more producers than there are people in the cast, because it takes that much money to put a show on.
- When the audience comes in, it changes the temperature of what you've written.
- My idea of heaven is not writing.
- The worst thing you can do is censor yourself as the pencil hits the paper. You must not edit until you get it all on paper. If you can put everything down, stream-of-consciousness, you'll do yourself a service.
- Generally, the best recording is the original cast, because that's the way the piece grew: integrally, with them.
- I'm interested in the theater because I'm interested in communication with audiences. Otherwise I would be in concert music.
- I was a mathematician by nature, and still am - I just knew I didn't want to be a mathematician. So I decided not to take any mathematics courses.
- One difference between poetry and lyrics is that lyrics sort of fade into the background. They fade on the page and live on the stage when set to music.
- I'm always conscious of what I'm writing, conscious of what the actor may ask me. I have a defense for nearly every line in the song.
- Nice is different than good.
- The nice thing about doing a crossword puzzle is, you know there is a solution.
- The more restrictions you have, the easier anything is to write.
- Math and music are intimately related. Not necessarily on a conscious level, but sure.
- When I'm writing a song, I try to be the character.
- I'm a great audience. I cry very easily. I suspend disbelief in two seconds.
- You can't have personal investors anymore because it's too expensive, so you have to have corporate investment or a lot of rich people.
- I think 'lunch' is one of the funniest words in the world.
- So many good songs get written fast, because you know exactly what has to work.
- Everybody faces a blank piece of paper, no matter what they've written or painted or composed before. I can't imagine approaching every single new project with-without doubt.
- I have, by nature, an analytical mind.
- Making lyrics feel natural, sit on music in such a way that you don't feel the effort of the author, so that they shine and bubble and rise and fall, is very, very hard to do. Whereas you can sit at the piano and just play and feel you're making art.
- I played the organ when I went to military school, when I was 10. They had a huge organ, the second-largest pipe organ in New York State. I loved all the buttons and the gadgets. I've always been a gadget man.
- I happen to like movies and plays about dislikeable people as long as I get to know why they are what they are.
- One of the hardest things about writing lyrics is to make the lyrics sit on the music in such a way that you're not aware there was a writer there.
- Oscar Hammerstein was a surrogate father during all those many days, and weeks and months when I didn't see my own father.
- Lyrics have to be underwritten. That's why poets generally make poor lyric writers because the language is too rich. You get drowned in it.
- If you force yourself to write away from the piano, you come up with more inventive things. If you're too good a piano player, as some composers are, the music may become flavorless and glib. And if you're not a very good pianist, you're limited to the same patterns.
- If you're dealing with a musical in which you're trying to tell a story, it's got to sound like speech. At the same time it's got to be a song.
- All the best performers bring to their role something more, something different than what the author put on paper. That's what makes theatre live. That's why it persists.
- In the Rodgers and Hammerstein generation, popular hits came out of shows and movies.
- Every time one can write a self-deluded song, you are way ahead of the game, way ahead. Self-delusion is the basis of nearly all the great scenes in all the great plays, from 'Oedipus' to 'Hamlet.'
- Two of the hardest words in the language to rhyme are life and love. Of all words!
- I'm very opinionated about movie musicals when they're adapted from live shows. You'll sit still for a three-minute song in a theater. But in movies, a glance from someone's eyes will tell you the whole story in a few seconds.
- Musical comedies aren't written, they are rewritten.
- I chose and my world was shaken. So what? The choice may have been mistaken; the choosing was not. You have to move on.
- My mother wanted me off her hands. She was a working woman. She designed clothes, and she was a celebrity collector. It's my mother's ambition to be a celebrity.
- The movie adaptations of stage musicals that I've seen, without exception, in my opinion don't work. A lot of people would disagree with me.
- I love the theater as much as music, and the whole idea of getting across to an audience and making them laugh, making them cry - just making them feel - is paramount to me.
- Art, in itself, is an attempt to bring order out of chaos.
- I don't find my life that interesting. The shows, maybe. But not me.
- I really don't want to write a score until the whole show is cast and staged.
- A close-up on screen can say all a song can.
- I don't listen to recordings of my songs. I don't avoid it, I just don't go out of my way to do it.
- My personal life and my artistic life do not interfere with each other.
- I firmly believe lyrics have to breathe and give the audience's ear a chance to understand what's going on. Particularly in the theater, where you have costume, story, acting, orchestra.
- When the song is part of the action and working as dialogue, even two minutes is way too long.
- I have inherited my father's sense of humour about myself. It's a lot more pleasant to make fun of yourself than when someone else does.
- The fact is popular art dates. It grows quaint. How many people feel strongly about Gilbert and Sullivan today compared to those who felt strongly in 1890?
- The dumbing down of the country reflects itself on Broadway. The shows get dumber, and the public gets used to them.
- On stage, generally speaking, the story is stopped or held back by songs, because that's the convention. Audiences enjoy the song and the singer, that's the point.
- I fell into lyric writing because of music. I backed into it.
- Musicals are, by nature, theatrical, meaning poetic, meaning having to move the audience's imagination and create a suspension of disbelief, by which I mean there's no fourth wall.
- If people have split views about your work, I think it's flattering. I'd rather have them feel something about it than dismiss it.
- Every writer I've ever spoken to feels fraudulent in some way or other.
- I would have been a geologist.
- By the time I was 22, I was a professional. A young and flawed professional, but not an amateur.
- I was raised to be charming, not sincere.
- After the Rodgers and Hammerstein revolution, songs became part of the story, as opposed to just entertainments in between comedy scenes.
- When I was growing up, there was no such thing as Off-Broadway. You either got your show on or you didn't.
- Gotta watch out for directors.
- My parents weren't around much, but I assumed everybody's family was the same. I didn't know people had mummies and daddies who would give them milk and cookies after school. I just thought everybody lived on Central Park West and they had a nanny to take care of them.
- I was essentially trained by Oscar Hammerstein to think of songs as one-act plays, to move a song from point A to point B dramatically.
- Musicals are plays, but the last collaborator is your audience, so you've got to wait 'til the last collaborator comes in before you can complete the collaboration.
