- Mine has been a pretty strange path.
- It's easy to scare people. It's easy to shock them. But making people laugh and making them feel is a big challenge.
- One of the important things to look at is kids who aren't cheerleaders or aren't the student-body presidents. In 'Daddy Day Care,' one of the kids would only communicate in Klingon. I get that kind of a kid.
- I remember when 'Daddy Day Care' came out, I saw fathers and their sons and daughters walking out of the theater and talking about the movie. That's the neatest thing.
- I didn't go to film school; I studied fine art - I learned how to be a filmmaker on everybody else's money.
- I've done hip-hop videos, family comedies, a quirky comedy.
- I learned how to tell stories with Jay-Z on 'City Is Mine.' I learned how to film and choreograph dancing on 'Can I Get A...,' and I got to kind of be a documentary filmmaker with 'Hard Knock Life.'
- What I've always loved are movies like 'When Harry Met Sally'... and 'The Sure Thing.'
- I wanted to do something raw and raucous and R-rated. But then 'Middle School: the Worst Years of My Life' came to me. One reason I took this movie on is because I saw it as a really great opportunity to revisit my own past through this character.
- There are a lot of action movies with very little comedy.
- There are a lot of films that come out for kids, and the parents have to suffer through it.
- My sketchbook became everything to me.
- 'City Is Mine' was a real big video for me and a good opportunity to learn how to play out a scene.
- I always felt a little bit on the outside.
- I've worked on a set before, know something about cameras, and done some editing.
- I express myself through my art.
