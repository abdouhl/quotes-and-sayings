- In the E.U., the initiation of policy comes from the European Commission - not the European parliament, the European Commission, an appointed body; a committee of 27 countries where everything is haggled away.

- Kamala Harris is a serious person who as California attorney general tried to tackle tough social problems in a way that most conservatives would support.

- I do not own a cellphone; I do not use a cellphone. I do not have a phone. No. Phone. Not even an old-fashioned dumb one. Nothing.

- Forget about war or disease or poverty. The apocalypse is when America's elected president is no longer supervised by the unelected ruling establishment.

- Our democracies are increasingly captured by a ruling class that seeks to perpetuate its privileges.
- There's an ideological belief on the left that you should not use nonpartisan tools.

- When Corbyn was elected, I found there was a lot to welcome there.
- Obama never listened to anyone, always thought he was smarter than every expert in the room, and treated every meeting as an opportunity to lecture everyone else. This led to real-world disasters, like Syria and the rise of Isis.
- I think the only way to actually move China in a positive direction is to disengage from China, to decouple our economy, our cultural ties, our sporting ties so that you put pressure on their regime.
- Most parents don't want their kids to have smartphones in the first place. But parents worry about the social stigma of their child being the only one without a phone.
- The entire debate around a 'No Deal' Brexit assigns a vastly overstated importance to the role of government in daily life.

- I'd love to have Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump together. How amazing would that be?
- The most important thing about a candidate is not their promises - those hardly ever get delivered anyway. It's about how they would respond to unpredictable future events. And that's about their character.
- What's going on for half the country? Who's lost out? The victims of elitist agenda; standing up for them, being a voice for them. That's the idea behind positive populism, that's what drives the content.

- Leaving the E.U. enables the U.K. to be more engaged with the global economy, not just the European economy.
- The left has become increasingly dogmatic on immigration. Any position short of supporting open borders is described as racist. That's nonsensical.

- You can do business with America or the authoritarian dictators of Beijing, who oppress their own people, put millions of Muslims in concentration camps, and are rolling out a new and insidious colonialism around the world with their rapacious belt and road infrastructure program. Which side are you on, Britain? Canada? The EU? You choose.
- The West's involvement in the Middle East has been a disaster from the start... and finally, with President Trump, America is in a position to bring it to an end.
- Membership of the E.U. makes Britain literally ungovernable, in the sense that no administration elected by the people can govern the country.

- I think much of the media is decadent in the sense that the people who are producing the coverage, they themselves live very comfortable lives.
- Look, I'm not expecting the establishment to suddenly open their arms to Donald Trump. But considering their own role in creating the long-term challenges that this president is now addressing, could they just show a little humility before embarking on their next Trump-hating rant?
- Whatever else people knew about Donald Trump going into 2016, it was obvious he was strong. He said what he thought, no matter who it offended.
- As far as I'm concerned, when the Queen, who we all love very much, is finished with her reign then Britain should go and stop being a banana republic as it is when we have the royal family and become a real republic.
- The people who typically tell the story of what's going on in America are from the booming parts of America. The presentation of issues is colored by that.
- It's the smartphone that has turned adults and children alike into tech-addicted zombies, dumbly swiping and jabbing at their screens, oblivious to the world around them.
- The Democrats' obsession with scandal is out of touch and decadent. People want substance, not scandal.
- This is the Trump revolution. Pragmatic. Non-ideological. He approaches issues as a businessman. It's a revolution in ideas and it goes way beyond foreign policy.
- For years we've had leaders who promised to end America's costly wars, only to cave in to the establishment view.
- With President Trump, we see income growth in states like Iowa, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Nevada, Florida - wing states that went to Trump in 2016 because he promised not to forget about them, like the establishment had done for decades. And their trust in President Trump quite literally paid off as they saw their incomes rise.
- There has been this slightly naive and perhaps arrogant view that technology can completely reinvent the political system and the way that government and politics works, which is ridiculous.
- The Committee to Save America. Have you ever heard anything more smug, more pompous but - most importantly - more anti-democratic? Because it turns out that the Committee to Save America was really the Committee to Save the American Establishment.

- We didn't move here so I could save American democracy. But I've embraced it with the zeal of a convert.
- On issue after issue, yes, Trump is barging in. Yes, he is throwing out the old playbook. It's called change, and unlike Obama, who talked endlessly about change, President Trump is actually delivering it.

- Even when they are trying to deceive the voters, the Democrats are incompetent.
- Abolish the monarchy. That is my populist take.
