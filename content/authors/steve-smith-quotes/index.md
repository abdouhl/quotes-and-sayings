- You want to keep getting better every day.
- My record probably is better when I'm captain than when I'm not. That sort of pressure doesn't really bother me.
- I'm not a huge drinker.
- If it takes me 300 balls to get a 100, then it'll take me 300 balls. That'll also tire the bowlers quite a bit too, so it's a bit of a win-win if that's the case.
- I don't like being back in the sheds, I prefer being out in the middle and just doing my thing.
- We don't go out there to try and lose games of cricket, we go out there to try and win and play the best way we can.
- I've always dreamt of playing in a shield final with NSW and to win it and to be captain of the side, it's a great thrill.
- I think winning can become a bit of a habit.
- It did help having a lot of exposure to international cricket at such a young age. That showed me what I need to do to be successful at that level.
- I've just aimed to go out with a clear mind; to try not to premeditate my shots and if I'm going to play a few big shots I try to have a few deliveries under my belt first; have my eye in a bit better.
- People can talk about whatever they want, doesn't mean I have it in my head.
- To be able to say I am an Ashes-winning captain... just hearing those words and saying them myself is pretty special.
- I try to be as honest as I can and that's the best way to do things.
- I have always seen myself more as a batsman than a bowler.
- I don't like bowling that much. Every now and then, it's fine.
- It's what I always wanted to do, play in the Australian side as a batsman.
- I remember Kevin Pietersen and Ian Bell getting into me quite a bit. I don't think they really rated the way I played. But maybe I've changed their views now perhaps a little bit.
- There are a lot of carbs in beer.
- I think everyone is vulnerable to a moving ball. It's about just trying to find a way to have a solid defence and a game plan that can work in those conditions.
- I've faced a lot of short pitched bowling in my life and haven't had too many issues with it.
- Selectors are there to do a job. They pick what they see as best for the team.
- It depends upon the make-up of the team where I'm going to bat.
- I've performed pretty well in the games I've captained Australia in and hopefully I can keep it up.
- When I am out there I pay no attention to the crowd and just move on with playing the game.
- For me, it's about having energy in the field and making sure I'm having fun and making sure everyone else around is having fun, whether it be telling a joke or something like that. It's to make sure we're all upbeat and we're ready to go.
- A bit of a verbal challenge actually makes me switch on a bit more and gets me in for the fight.
- We like to play good, hard, tough, aggressive cricket when we're out in the field.
- For me, it's about making sure the mental side of my game is in a good place; if it is, then it's just about backing your ability when you are out in the middle and doing what you can for the team.
- If I am bowling in a game, that means we're in trouble. So hopefully, it doesn't happen too often.
- With training for T20, I try to clear the fence a lot.
- I have always self-coached. It's something that I am big on.
- It depends on who's bowling, how is the wicket playing, how I gonna score and stuff like that or how people are trying to get me out, probably that determines how open I am or otherwise how closed I am.
- If you look at the best players around the world, they sum up what people are trying to do and adapt to it and are willing to change and have the confidence to change what they are doing to get the right outcome.
- My job is to score runs and hopefully I can continue to do that.
- First and foremost I'm a batsman in the side and that's my job, to score runs.
- I generally have been a good player of spin.
- I think part of being a professional cricket player is being able to adapt to conditions.
- I've played a lot of T20 cricket and know the game.
- It's just about getting those runs on the board and the more I can do that, the more I can put my name up there.
- Look, I admire Virat a lot. He is an amazing player.
- I guess everyone is entitled their opinion and how they want to treat people, but it is water of a duck's back.
- The thing for me is my defence: as long as my defence is in good order then I feel the rest of my game can expand from there.
- I would call myself a cricket nuffie. I love watching cricket. But I've found other things in my life.
- I've always been one to want a fair contest between bat and ball even as a batter, so if that's taken away I don't think that's great.
- For me it's about being adaptable wherever we play.
- Everyone makes mistakes; it's about the way you respond to it that's really important.
- It really gave me a lot of confidence to know that I could score runs against some really good bowlers.
- An Ashes series is huge for Australian cricketers - and English cricketers for that matter - and there's always that added pressure.
- It's the pinnacle of Australian cricket, playing in an Ashes series.
- Obviously the safety and security of the players is the biggest concern.
- I think that's the way we play our best cricket, when we're aggressive, we're in the fight together, we're hunting as a pack as one and we're working for each other and backing our mates up on the field. That's part of being an Australian, in my opinion.
- I would have enjoyed playing some county cricket and learning my art that way, but I never had any ambitions at all to play for England, that's for sure.
- That's pretty important to me - to make sure I'm leading from the front.
- In Australia you can be a little bit more attacking, in places on the subcontinent you've got to find ways to get batsmen out, you might have to bore them out.
- We want to be No.1 in all three formats.
- It's always tough playing India in India.
- I'll just do my own thing and just keep working hard to play hard.
- When you're under pressure and your heart's pumping, you almost go back to what you know.
- I think the higher you can bat in your Shield team, if you're doing well there the better off you're going to be for batting anywhere in the Test line-up or any of the line-ups.
- When you're in good form and hitting the ball well you want to keep playing as much as you can and not have too much of a break.
- I've certainly had some difficult days. But it's OK to be vulnerable.
- I got rid of one bat tap I used to have as I was about to face up, and getting rid of that's made me more stable and able to get in better positions and play, particularly fast bowling, a lot easier.
- I always had the belief in my ability. I just needed something to prove it to myself.
- I'd say that probably 95 per cent of batting is mental and decision-making.
- In the shorter form of the game, I think I'm getting a lot smarter with the way I'm approaching my innings and also the way I read the game.
- I look at some of the best players around the world and sometimes I do try and bat like them.
- The on-field stuff, setting fields, changing bowlers, that's the easy part. It's making sure all your players are on the same page with what your plans are and what you want from your players and the team. That's the biggest challenge and what you really need to get right if you want your team to be successful.
- I wear football socks and I actually tape my shoelaces to my socks. I don't like anything to be putting me off. I don't have an excuse of the shoelaces coming off.
- People say I am a little bit weird with the way I go about things, it's a fine line.
- There has been a lot of talk of the four-day Tests but I like five-days. I don't make the decisions of how it all works out but five-day Tests is what it is all about.
- I don't like watching others batting and scoring runs I could be scoring. It is nice to see guys being successful but at the same time I want to be the one out there doing it.
- I'd love to play every game.
- It's nice to have someone to come home to and get the honest truth about all aspects of life.
- You never know in T20 cricket. Anyone can have a day out and take the game away from you.
- I watch the game pretty closely and think of a few things that I'd do perhaps differently to what's going on and throw up ideas here and there as well.
- I'm very hard on myself.
- I guess the thing with South Africa and Australia, the conditions are probably the two most similar around the world. The pace in the wickets are generally pretty similar, and the pace and bounce.
- Obviously, I did not start my Test career too well. With the bat, I was probably not quite ready to play at that stage. I was happy to go back to first-class system and learn my game a bit more, honing my skills, particularly my defence and patience.
- I think the Australian public would love to see the best Australian team on the park for every game. It's difficult to do that with the schedule and how much we play.
- I actually think I play better with pressure, that extra pressure when the team needs something more and things like that.
- I think I've been able to withstand pressure and know that things get easier and I think, when they've got easier, I've cashed in.
- I've copied a bit of what AB de Villiers does. The way I go back and across to open myself up and set myself for the shots.
- To be dropped is not a nice thing.
- Particularly when I'm batting, I don't really hear anything that's going on. I block it all out. Maybe a little bit when I'm fielding but then again, it's just words. It doesn't affect me. If people want to say things then go for it.
- I don't like watching cricket, believe it or not.
- When you've got off to a good start and you've got wickets in the shed you've got to keep trying to take the game on.
- I love to speak to Brad Haddin, Simon Katich. All different people. Quality people with opinions I can trust.
- I think you always need some luck when you score big runs.
- During a Test match I am not a very good sleeper, mainly because I am visualising. Everything is positive. Nothing negative.
- A Boxing Day Test match is a fantastic occasion.
- T20 certainly is great for innovation.
- I am comfortable with five-days. I like the challenge of a five-day Test.
- It was an amazing feeling to be able to win a World Cup and at home in Australia.
- I just want to keep playing good cricket and winning games of cricket.
- It's great to retain the Ashes but it just doesn't sit right with me when you don't win it.
- I'm not in the game for personal accolades. I'm here to do my job and score as many runs for the team as I can.
- I think and visualise before I play where people are likely to bowl to me and where I am likely to score and try to picture fields that are set and play things over in my mind, where I am going to get runs and how they are looking to get me out.
- I generally play spinners quite aggressively.
- You can't score runs if you're sitting in the dressing room.
- With the spin bowling, it's about landing the ball in the right area enough, trying to build enough pressure, not let the batters get away.
