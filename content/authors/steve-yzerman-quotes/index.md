- Since the season ended, I've let things settle down, and I have to talk to the coaching staff and management. I really don't want to turn this into a big drama. So I plan on making a definite decision relatively quickly.

- I'm exhausted trying to stay healthy.
- We penalize and suspend players for making contact with the head while checking, in an effort to reduce head injuries, yet we still allow fighting. We're stuck in the middle and need to decide what kind of sport do we want to be. Either anything goes and we accept the consequences, or take the next step and eliminate fighting.
- I don't know that I'd agree I was our best player.
- I don't know if I've ever had a memorable body check. It's not really part of my game.
- When you're on the ice, you have very little time, you see very little, and everything happens really quick.
- It's been a great honor for me to be a player for the Detroit Red Wings, to play for an Original Six franchise. I know I'm far from perfect, but I learned a lot.

- As a kid in British Columbia, going back a long way, I learned to skate.
- When it gets to this point, it's just hard to pull the trigger.
- Playoff hockey is the best way to market your team. It's the best way to grow your fan base and give hope to your players and for them to develop.
- We used to play a lot outdoors, not in leagues, but just in our spare time.

- We have to get better at that. All of the Stanley Cup winning teams throughout the past few seasons, when they needed to play defense, they did it. If you can play defense, that's when you know it's game over.
