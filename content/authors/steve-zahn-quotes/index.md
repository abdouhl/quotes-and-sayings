- When I was younger, you get pigeonholed in parts, which is understandable.
- I was in high school, and I was the guy that always got cast in the school play. Theater is huge in high school in Minnesota, and I knew that I was very good at that, and gifted, and I was 'the guy,' but it still wasn't something I ever thought of as 'a job' or something that one could do professionally.
- I'm theater trained.
- I remember seeing 'Les Miserables' with the original cast - this was in '87 - and I was blown away by it.
- Most people laugh at situations rather than a tagline anyway.
- I still really love acting. I find it really challenging. And I really love film; it's a lot of fun.
- I moved to New York to do theater, and I got cast in a play that was funny, and then I was the funny guy. I did a movie that was funny, and then I was the funny guy.

- I don't have a publicist.
- I'm a good dad; I spend a lot of time with my kids.
- I've had more people come up to me about 'Saving Silverman' than anything else. That and 'That Thing You Do!' But 'Saving Silverman' is the one I get most often. And I love that.
- You work with stand-up comedians or you work with somebody in theater, you work with somebody from 'Star Search' or 'Survivor' or a kid, it constantly changes how you play with people.

- My parents were reasoned and deep thinkers. My dad is an intellectual and a literary man.

- I don't care if you've just won an Oscar, you still have to campaign for parts.
- Let me tell you something, planes and kids... I've got a 3 and 1 year old, I don't wish that on anybody.
- I've never had the luxury - or the nightmare - of having something just blow up and be this huge success and then have everything thrown at you. Being 'the best friend' lessens the responsibility, 'cause I can still go do another movie after something that doesn't do well.
- PlayStation 3 is another form of meditation. Come on, when you're on set, all day? That's what I do in my trailer, I just play PlayStation 3.
- I always gravitate toward the humor in something.
- People got to know me very gradually. It was little things. It's still like that. 'That Thing you Do!' was a big thing. It's always been very gradual. Like I say, people still ask me if I'm still acting. 'I've seen all your movies. What are you doing now?' Ha ha!
- I was going to be a Marine before I was going to be an actor. I was really serious about joining the Marine Corps.
- Film is a strange thing.
- I have raised beds, perennial beds, cut flower beds. I have an island on a pond that's just covered in peonies. I have an herb garden, tons of vegetables, raspberries. I have everything. I'm a green guy.
- I never wanted the business to dictate my life. I'm sure I've sacrificed and missed out on a lot of stuff, but I don't know what that stuff is, so I just raised kids, and I wanted to be around for that.
- I feed horses and goats and sheep all day and, once in a while, come and talk about movies.
- I remember seeing my sister in a play when I was very young, and I remember telling my folks, 'I want to do that.'
- I like to fish. I'm an outdoorsman. I love to hunt and fish.
- You still really fight for good parts. It never stops. It's never a breeze. The people at the top of their game work as hard as the people at the bottom.
- My dad was the chaplain at Mankato State University, and my mom worked in the bookstore. We lived just off-campus. Then we moved to the suburbs of Minneapolis, to New Hope, which is where I went to high school.
