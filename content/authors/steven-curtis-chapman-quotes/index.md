- I did nothing to deserve God's love; in fact, I was living as an orphan, without hope. Yet God chose to pursue a relationship with me, and through the death of his son Jesus, I was adopted into God's family.
- This is life we've been given, made to be lived out, so... live out loud.
- I want to live with that sense with the music I make, with the art I make, with the way I love my kids, with the way I am a father and a husband and a friend and a follower of Christ, I want to live with reckless abandonment to the truth of the Gospel.
- Country music is just country. It's going to shift around a little bit, doing some different instrumentations, different production styles. But it will always come back to what you heard at the Opry. Nobody wants it to change.
- When I go to Africa and spend more time there with people who are the least of the least, those in desperate situations, I am broken by it. But I also find people with so much more joy and freedom living with nothing than I see walking down the streets of my own community here in Tennessee.
- I am prone to reshape and refashion things to try and please as many people as I can, to get as many nods or smiles out of as many people as possible.
- Writing songs out of my faith was a real natural progression. I grew up singing in my dad's choir and singing with my family. Christian music became the music that I identified myself with and was a way that I expressed my faith. Even at a public school I would take my Christian music in and play it for my friends.
- I am in a business that's built on record sales and reputation and how your single is doing and where your song is on iTunes. But the kind of music that I do comes from my beliefs.
- If only 7 percent of the 2 billion Christians in the world would care for a single orphan in distress, there would effectively be no more orphans. If everybody would be willing to simply do something to care for one of these precious treasures, I think we would be amazed by just how much we could change the world.
- Success breeds volume, and it's just amazing how many young writers, artists, and musicians there are in town.
- I've always been a rule-follower. Even when I was a kid, I tried to do everything by the book.
- I enjoy being on stage with other artists. I have a chance to watch and see people responding to the other artists songs. I get to see how people are affected by the music.
- I believe very confidently in the truth of Scripture, where it says that there is no authority, no power given to man except as given by God.
- There's nothing like a good cheating song to make me want to run home to be with my wife.
- I would hate to be a new artist or writer in town today. But somehow the cream continues to rise. If there's one who's great, he just jumps out of the pack like you can't believe.
- What God wants is to reveal himself more fully to us.
- Cars are the reason we, you know, people live or die.
- I believe God weeps over - over death. Jesus wept at the grave the Lazarus. In the Bible, Jesus weeps at death.
- I've been here 21 years, and I literally did walk up and down Music Row trying to break into the business. I felt very free to go into any publishing company.
- I think we all want to know that if our lives don't turn out the way we imagine, there's still a purpose.
- That's one wonderful thing about country music - it shifts, ebbs, and flows stylistically, unlike pop music.
- As Christians, our compassion is simply a response to the love that God has already shown us.
