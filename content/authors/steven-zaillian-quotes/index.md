- I find that most of my scripts have a lot more scenes than most films, so the average movie might have 100 scenes, my average script has 300 scenes.
- I have no problem with anyone being precise about small things.
- I'm not one of those people who writes long soliloquies.
- People who would go to an arthouse cinema and watch a Swedish movie and read subtitles... it's a small percentage.
- The similarity between the big directors I've worked with is that they allow the writer to find a way of doing what they want done without saying 'do it this way.' They describe what they want, then letting the writer figure out a way to do it.
- The main thing that I learned from editing is that most people, when they're making a film, they start too early into the story. They will try to set up the characters, they will try to establish things before the plot actually starts.
