- I think, generally speaking as a player, when I hear the word 'scout,' it's usually, 'The Seattle Storm are playing the L.A. Sparks tomorrow; the assistant coaches are scouting the L.A. Sparks.' And then they come to us and give a scouting report on the players and the team.

- We're going to have a moment. It's coming: just that breakthrough that's going to give us a cool factor, and more people will want to be a part of it. Because that, to me, is the only thing we're lacking - that social thing: 'It's cool to go to a WNBA game.'
- Since I've been five, people asked me if we're related. It is usually the third question in the line of questions. What's your name? Sue Bird. Oh, what do you do? I play basketball. Are you related to Larry Bird? That's how it goes. I guess it could be worse, though, since he is a legend and all.

- I think it's hard to compare the NBA and the WNBA, but the thing about the NBA is they just have a ton of movement every year, but the WNBA doesn't.

- I've become really strict in a lot of ways, but I'm also very lenient. I'm kind to myself.
- As for Seattle, we are rebuilding - no doubt about it. And in the WNBA, it's not easy to rebuild. You can't dangle millions in front of quality free agents.
- I think when you're a kid coming out of college, you're just kinda going with the flow. You don't really understand what's happening around you - you're just out there playing basketball - but now that I'm older and I see where the league has come in my 15 years, it's pretty cool to have witnessed it.
- The reality is, like, women's basketball players are playing against women. And we're all in the same boat the same way men's sports is.
- Usually men, usually a guy, a casual fan of maybe the NBA and somebody who then watches the WNBA, their instinct is quick to kind of size us up or put themselves against us.
- Jay-Z, for a lot of reasons, will always be my favorite. But actually, in terms of what I listen to, it bends towards hip-hop, but I like everything. The only thing I don't really love is country, but everything else I'm a huge fan of.
- I'm probably, like, the nosiest person you'll ever meet. Not in a rude way, but I like to be in the know.
- I really subscribe to the 'look good, feel good' mantra in terms of playing, in terms of getting out there.

- I stick with all anti-inflammatory foods: tons of veggies, eggs, chicken, and fish. I will have some red meat, but only every now and then.
- People continue to put our league down. It's because we're women; that's the fight. And it's a majority of black women; that's the other fight. But we represent America to the fullest. And it's weird to me that people wouldn't want to support that. I don't get it.
- As quickly as you can go 4-1, you can go 1-4. And the whole objective is not to get too high and not to get too low. It's one thing to tell somebody that and explain it, but it's another thing to really buy in, to have felt that and understand what it means to stay even-keel. That's what you have to be in this league.
- A lot of us players, if you were to ask them, feel like they have to play overseas. Why? 'Why not? Might as well do it while I can.' For a while, I felt that way - I've got to make the most money that I can. Now, do I feel like I could still play overseas? Absolutely. But I don't feel that pressure anymore.
