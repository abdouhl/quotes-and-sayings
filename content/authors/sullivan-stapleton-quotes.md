- I love cooking. I like to make lasagna - it's authentic Italian-style. I also do a great chicken recipe for a barbecue.
- I never believed I'd have a six-pack, especially not at 35 years old. I always thought it was a genetic blessing. It's not. You just have to be willing to do what it takes.
- I started here in Australia, playing a lot of roles but never the lead guy in shows here. I always tended to play the rougher guy, the criminal who gets caught or shot by the cops. Or the boyfriend from the wrong side of the tracks.
- I keep my diet low in carbohydrates and high in protein.
- My aunt put my cousins into a children's modelling agency, then my mum did it with us. Me and my sister got a few TV adverts, which was good pocket money. A director saw photos of me and asked me to do a short film.
