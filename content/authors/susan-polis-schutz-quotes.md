- Getting better from depression demands a lifelong commitment. I've made that commitment for my life's sake and for the sake of those who love me.
- My own life was filled with so much love and joy that when depression struck, it was like a prison door slamming shut and I was being placed in an isolation cell. No one else could possibly be feeling what I was. I hated my depression and all of its symptoms.
- Through my own struggles with depression, I discovered that knowledge, therapy, medication and education can provide the strength to get through it in one piece.
- It's often difficult for those who are lucky enough to have never experienced what true depression is to imagine a life of complete hopelessness, emptiness and fear.
- Spreading the word about depression is my mission. I am working to build awareness, educate people about the symptoms, and change public opinion and individual attitudes about depression.
- I was always a happy and loving person. Many would say that I was living an idyllic life.
