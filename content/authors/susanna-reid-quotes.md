- Behind the glossy hair and smart dresses you see on TV, this is who I am: a busy working mum like any other.
- I don't credit diet pills for my weight loss. I would never flog any 'weight-loss' supplement.
- My natural curviness means I will never be considered lean. I can be healthy, but lean - no.
- I don't even have an iron. Yes, it means I can't own crisp, white shirts - but that's a sacrifice I'm willing to make. My clothes simply emerge pristine from the dryer. Jeans don't crease and, for work, stretchy Lycra holds its shape.
- I am not religious, but I still feel there is a sacredness about Mothering Sunday, even when I'm just enjoying a lie-in and a cup of tea from my boys.
- Apparently, there are all sorts of reasons why your hair might stop growing, including split ends, breakage and overuse of heated styling tools - in my case, it might be a combination of all three!
- For women, 50 has too long been seen as a symbolic cut-off point. A roadblock where your energy, vitality and career prospects were once expected to come to a screeching halt.
- Fiona Bruce isn't some token middle-aged woman at the BBC. Alongside her, at 52, my former running partner Sophie Raworth is a familiar face on our screens, with enough energy to run the scorching desert challenge, Marathon des Sables, to celebrate her 50th.
- I like to think of hairdressers as an essential service.
- My interest in self-help began when I was a child in the Seventies. My mum had a book she would consult regularly: 'Passages' by Gail Sheehy, which deals with the challenging stages of growing up.
- Let's face it, staying at home has its appeal. The modern family set-up with both parents working is fraught with challenges most of us will have experienced.
- And the more goals we set, the more we ramp ourselves up into bouncing coffee beans of caffeinated fury, ready to fly off the handle at the slightest trigger.
- Marathon runner Sophie Raworth is always trying to get me to put my running shoes back on, but I can't match her for fitness.
- On 'Good Morning Britain' I regularly re-wear outfits, and my wardrobe at home is the same few jumpers and jeans.
- Shutting people away, cooped up in cramped accommodation, is a recipe for frustration and despair. It is impossible for families in one-bedroom flats to get space from each other. No garden, no balcony, no patio means little activity for children.
- I've never worn Prada, I'm more TK Maxx than Harrods, I've always found clothes from the catwalk don't usually flatter my shape.
- The Victoria's Secret fashion shows? I've always detested them. Not only because they made me feel insanely jealous of the utter magnificence of the models, but also because I couldn't stop myself falling for the fantasy.
- My work means that a dressy outfit and full face of make-up is everyday wear, even in lockdown. But it's such a relief to take it all off after the show and know there's no prospect of having to find a second wind at the other end of the day, putting the armour back on again.
- The possibility of sending an innocent person to their death is a reason why I'm against the death penalty.
- I'm a proud ex-BBC employee, but its flip-flop over presenter Naga Munchetty - first censured for sharing her experience of racism, then absolved when the decision caused uproar - doesn't look good.
- I don't get time to read often - the last hour before bed is somehow always spent clearing up the day's mess instead.
- On average, a prisoner in the U.S. spends around ten years on Death Row before execution.
- I trust ITV to pay me what I should be paid.
- Many people don't want to read the news on a phone. I'm the same, and so is my dad, for whom I'm trying to organise a daily newspaper delivery.
- Women telling men to step out of roles so they can step into them isn't going to endear people to feminism. Neither is telling women they are betraying feminism by enjoying the pleasures of being a traditional housewife.
- My mum is proud to have been a nurse. At the beginning, she worked a basic 44-hour week, split shifts, night shifts and rarely had a weekend off.
- When it comes to the great either/or of pet ownership, I am definitely a cat person.
- For many women, adopting a traditional full-time domestic role would be unthinkable. But if being at home and looking after your husband works for you, I'm behind you.
- Too few nurses puts patients at risk. It also risks the mental and physical health of the nurses we do have, as the fewer staff there are on a ward, the harder it gets to pick up the pieces.
- Hugging has been a social hot potato for a while. On the one hand, we are increasingly aware of touch being good for our wellbeing, and on the other, some workplace tribunals have deemed touching inappropriate.
- To be fair, I have no idea what my natural hair colour is any more - and I have no intention of finding out after 20 years of dedicated dyeing. I go to a local salon every few weeks to have my roots done when they have barely emerged.
- I've lived in my house for 20 years and, while I love to travel, I don't dream of moving abroad. Give me home comforts and shops, schools and friends' welcoming kitchens within walking distance any day.
- I won't be cycling to work any time soon. It's too dark when I leave home at 4am, there's too many speeding drivers and helmet hair wouldn't look good on air. But I still want to do it.
- When I was little I adored the windy beaches of Ventor and the dinosaur cliffs at Alum Bay. I was thrilled to take the cable car, and I coveted the layers of coloured sand in tiny jars in the gift shop.
- When my boys were little and food wasn't easily delivered via an app, the restaurant at the end of the road was my saviour.
- The modest three hours a day I spend with my colleagues is about right - I certainly couldn't imagine going into quarantine with them.
- Sometimes, the best way to handle all the nasty comments is to send a snappy reply to one particularly foul one. Trolls need to know that if they are rude, they may be made an example of.
- After chatting happily to people all morning in my professional life, I prefer to spend quiet nights in, punctuated only by the occasional grunted demand for food from a passing teenager.
- The truth is women have a tendency to say 'yes' even when we're at tipping point. The challenge is saying 'enough'.
- There is only one Piers Morgan. But no one is completely irreplaceable, no matter who they are.
- At the heart of my family is a woman who has spent 60 years taking care of others. Nurse Grandma, as we affectionately call her - my mum Sue - is who everyone in our family calls when there's a cough that won't go, or a temperature that needs bringing down.
- But for women - and, yes, this is strictly applicable to females - grey hair is still a rarity, especially if you're in the public eye.
- When my first grey hairs appeared in my 30s, a senior BBC producer quietly took me aside and told me to cover them up. It was the first time I realised being youthful was a job requirement - looking older was not allowed.
- I've always had to drag myself to fancy parties and steel myself to walk into a crowded room. The pop of the red carpet camera bulbs might look like fun, but I make a swift dash up that celebrity catwalk, worrying about whether the photographers have caught an unflattering angle or a gust of wind will whisk away my fake ponytail.
- But when you work long hours, you never want your children to think they're not a priority - so something else in the schedule has to give instead. Inevitably, the thing to go is time for yourself.
- When you work in TV you have to develop a thick skin, and I have certainly grown used to criticism.
- To be honest, I'm no Marie Kondo at the best of times. I like living in comfortable clutter and have a peculiar kind of perception that enables me to ignore it. I call it Mess Blindness.
- I may have been through the pain of childbirth three times, but I'm incredibly nervous about having my upper ear pierced.
- There's no greater challenge, for most parents, than letting a growing teen go out into the world, knowing he is exposed to risk, but that it is also your duty to let him go.
- Although we have to do a tight three-point turn when leaving work, I pride myself on my driving skills. I'm not intimidated by a tight spot of parallel parking, passed my driving test first time and was always the designated driver in my group of friends.
- Sure, I might come across as an extrovert on television, but I am not a particularly gregarious person.
- I'm all for making ourselves look good - as long as we feel good, too. Feeling under pressure to look the same means we've gone too far.
- I have never subscribed to the idea that it's necessary to greet someone in the office by wrapping arms and touching backs.
- Women of my generation aren't becoming more conservative as we get older. On the contrary, we're less concerned about what people think.
- During the war, women without nylons drew lines up the backs of their legs to give the illusion of silk stockings. Painting over grey hair with spray-on root touch-up - or even dark eyeshadow - is the Covid-19 equivalent.
- I get at least six hours each night, meaning I am generally in bed at 9pm. Then, to top up my sleep, I take a nap as soon as I get home from the studio each morning at 9.30am. Although my sleep is broken into two chunks, this makes up a seven-hour total that keeps me going.
- I may look like I'm in control on TV, but underneath I'm trying to hold it together like we all are. Here's to busy mums everywhere and the power to, occasionally, say 'enough'.
- I don't eat meat, but I do cook it for my sons, so I'm a slave to expiry dates. I have a different approach to vegetables, since they don't come out of the ground with a best-before sticker. I have red onions in the fridge which are six months old, but I'll still happily eat them.
- I won't hold back from sharing my opinions. But I'll also be fair, taking on the topics of the day with a positive, no-nonsense attitude - and a great sense of fun.
- I've been trolled myself for adding on pounds and would dread the negative comments if I posted beach pictures.
- But feminism isn't served by simply promoting women over men. The winner needs to be the best candidate for the job, not the best candidate of a certain gender.
- Talking about weight at all - even your own - has become increasingly tricky, especially if you dare to say that you would quite like to lose a few pounds.
- As a studious schoolgirl, I'd go back into the classroom every autumn brimming with enthusiasm.
- Don't ask me why, but it always feels intrusive to look at other people's junk.
- I would love to own a dog, but somehow a dog is just not me. I've always had the distinct impression that they are less like a pet and more like another child.
- But let me be honest, I would rather wear a hazmat suit on holiday than get caught by a camera in swimwear.
- From the outside, it looks like I've got my life sorted, but all too often I find myself awake at night, worrying about keeping all those spinning plates in the air.
- Reality show TV star is a familiar job, and to knock it would be the height of hypocrisy for someone like me who has made their career on television.
- My constant advice to my family - 'hopes high, expectations low' - is based on the idea that we can try our best to be perfect, but sometimes good enough has to be good enough.
- Is it just me, or did 2019 feel like an endless fight? Tension over Brexit and climate-change protests trickled down into our everyday lives, putting pressure on every relationship.
- I do think the glitz of reality stars and social media is changing our society. At 20, I barely wore make-up and rarely visited a hairdresser.
- I have never thought of myself as a gym bunny, but I just couldn't get into working out at home.
- While everyone rails against the Covidiots who are panic-buying toilet rolls, can I put my hand up and admit I have stocked up?
- When I did lose weight, by the way, I did it because my doctor recommended it. My secret isn't a pill. I took individual steps to eat more healthily, cutting down on unhealthy snacking and the empty calories of alcohol.
- Cats are notoriously fickle. Regular feeding at a different house might be enough to tempt them away, insensitive to your own feelings of attachment.
- I once went to the Mayfair club Annabel's and the best thing about it was the Ladies. Perfumed air, exotic wallpaper, full-length mirrors - when you've had enough of the bustle, it's like having a rest in a boudoir: a female sanctuary.
- 'Fake' used to be an insult, but now it's a badge of honour, with hair extensions, tans and nails all artificial, but looking fabulous.
- In my experience, there is more rivalry between male counterparts. Take ITV's Piers Morgan and Dan Walker, his BBC Breakfast double. The way they snipe at each other on Twitter makes me shudder. I would never speak about a colleague like that.
- Losing weight should be done for health, not because a star claims to have a magic product or formula.
- Instead of respecting nurses, we have started blaming them for problems they don't create. And, in doing so, we are making everyone less safe.
- Sleep deprivation and I are old friends. I've been familiar with it for almost 20 years, ever since I started getting up at ridiculous o'clock for breakfast TV.
- As a journalist, you want to try to maintain that objectivity and detachment.
- Emma Thompson and her husband, Greg Wise, have become citizens of Venice. I'm not sure whether it's just laziness, or fear of one of life's most stressful events - moving house - but you won't budge me from South London.
- Without hugs seeing a face on a screen carries a weight of meaning and emotion.
- When I was 13, I had ambitions to act and, in 1984, filmed a drama called 'The Price'. I played the daughter of brilliant actress Harriet Walter.
- Normally, I have to be dragged kicking and screaming into the festive spirit. I'm not a Scrooge. But when I was growing up, Christmas didn't begin until mid-December.
- The thing is, I am addicted to social media. I can while away hours scrolling through posts and pictures, wallowing in the details of other people's lives, catching up on news, giggling at funny videos, all the while oblivious to a sunny afternoon or the washing up.
- I always make my bed when I get up so it looks fresh and inviting, although the rest of the house might, at times, be a tip.
- Students like my son, who has a place at university which is dependent on getting the right grades, must place his fate in the hands of two groups of people: teachers and a faceless team at Ofqual, the exam regulator.
- Social distancing means that celebrity parties and gatherings are still a long way off, but I'm not in the least bit bothered about them starting up again.
- I think about my mum staying up all night with me when I was cramming for exams, and supporting me through all of life's ups and downs.
- Ageing is a blessing, and I feel every inch of 46.
- I've done what people have been urging me to do for quite some time. I have finally gagged Piers Morgan.
- I would never say no at a red-carpet event. It's part of the job. Without the viewers we are nothing, so a simple picture is hardly too much to ask.
- For a fan, a selfie takes just a moment and those who dare to ask, win. But for the celeb, the seconds can add up to never having a moment to themselves.

- Social media has become a dark place, and the sites need to clean up their act if they want people to keep using them.
- I wanted to be an actor when I was young, and I wanted to be a detective.
