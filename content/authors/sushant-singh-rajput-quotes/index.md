- I have been blessed with strong leg muscles, and dancing really exercises one's legs.

- I was offered 10-12 films during the time that we were working on 'Paani.'

- When I was young, I was supposed to study in the afternoon, and 4 - 5:30 P.M. was playtime. The entire day would revolve around that time. We would play anything - kabaddi, cricket. Those one and half hours would feel like 5 minutes.

- I realised quite early that by the time I articulate my thoughts into words, I'm on to another thought. And what comes out wasn't what I thought of exactly. So not talking was a better option.

- I pray to God every day that he makes me the biggest superstar, but before that, I ask God to make me a good actor. Being a star is hard, but being an actor is even harder. I want to be both before I am done.

- I might not be over-enthusiastic about socialising and making friends, but I am not a loner. I love hanging out with my friends, and I do it often when I am not working. Maybe, since I am not often invited to the 'happening' parties of our industry, where the media is around, I have earned the reputation of being a loner.
- I've been a fan of Dhoni for years. I've seen him play for India for over 10 years.
- An actor has to remember the primary reason why he chose the profession that he did. If every role that I do doesn't challenge me, then what is the point of being an actor?

- Nawazuddin Siddiqui is the best actor because his choice of roles are so diametrically opposite from each other, and he pulls it off almost every time so convincingly.

- I've stopped taking myself seriously because now I understand how fickle my thoughts are.

- I wanted to be a cricketer. But I was not skilled enough to be a national-level cricketer.
- I have songs that define characters from each film of mine. It can be a song from that particular film or something that just goes with the wavelength of the film; you listen to it, and it gives you that rhythm. I can't articulate how it helps, but it somehow gives you an understanding of the character.
- Practical knowledge of what works and what doesn't work is much better. Theoretical knowledge is important, but I think practical knowledge works better.
- Frankly, I'm an actor right now because of Shah Rukh. When I was in school and even when studying engineering, I used to watch his films.

- As an actor, you think you know your craft, you know the conflicts in your character, but often you don't.
- I am not saying that those who crave for conventional stardom are wrong in their aspirations. But that's not what I want.
- The closest synonym of happiness is excitement, and you can generate it by doing something that you can't completely comprehend. This understanding makes the process rich and exciting.

- I have seen extreme lows because of factors that were not in my hands - be it not having money to buy my first bike, dropping out of a prestigious engineering college without having a single rupee in my bank account, living with seven boys in a single-room kitchen in Mumbai, or eating nothing but khichdi every day. But I cherish all those moments.
- Given a chance, I would love to romance Tabu. I wouldn't mind doing a film with Manisha Koirala, either. Or Madhuri Dixit.
- No matter what you achieve, what you want to aspire to be, or how famous and powerful you become, the most important thing is whether you are excited about each and every moment of your life because of your work and people around you.
