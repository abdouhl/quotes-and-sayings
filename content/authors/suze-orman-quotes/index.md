I can't show up at this party and not have something for everybody.'
- I'm a big advocate of a work-for-pay setup rather than an allowance that isn't attached to chores - it's a great way to impart the value of money to your children.

- Thoughtful financial planning can easily take a backseat to daily life.
- When you lose something in your life, stop thinking it's a loss for you... it is a gift you have been given so you can get on the right path to where you are meant to go, not to where you think you should have gone.
- If you're saving for the long run, it's actually a good thing when the market is down because the more shares you have, the more you can potentially make when markets rise. And over time - decades, not months - the markets rise more than they fall.
- Even if you were to fall into extreme financial hardship and file for bankruptcy, you need to understand that your student loan debt will not be discharged in bankruptcy. It is the Velcro of all debts.
- I generally encourage people to make good on debts when they have enough money to repay them.

The damage has already been done, and the blemish will remain on your credit report for seven years.
- Here's my gift-giving rule: Respect your current financial situation.
- Not everything is about money.
- The new American dream is one of responsibility. What is the bottom-line number that you're going to be able to pay back toward a student loan responsibly if you're doing it yourself after you have a job? That dictates the amount of money you can borrow. That dictates the school you can go to, if you can even go to a four-year college at all.

- Cash - in savings accounts, short-term CDs or money market deposits - is great for an emergency fund.

- People first, then money, then things.

- If you wait to see how much money you have left at the end of the month to put toward savings, the answer may be zero. So, set up an automated monthly transfer from your checking to savings account. Once you lock into that commitment, you'll be forced to scale back spending to make ends meet.
