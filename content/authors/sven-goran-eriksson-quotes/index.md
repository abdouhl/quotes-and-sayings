- I would like to return to the Premier League but I think if you put that question to more or less every manager in the world, then they would like to do it as well.

- There is so many good people in Africa. And a huge talent among the football players.
- I have a big TV screen and I sit there and watch the Premier League and I get angry sometimes - 'I'm better than that guy sitting there.' Of course, I am joking. But I analyse. I look at it technically, how they play, how they defend, how they attack, why did he change that player? That's the only way I can look at it after all these years.
- To leave a job with a bad result is, I think, the worst thing in life to do. They will always remember you as a loser.

- I didn't care: if I liked a woman and wanted to meet her, why shouldn't I be able to?
- Personally, I was oblivious to any financial hardships that my parents endured.

- The big question for me is - are the players happy? Because in my mind it is all about building the right relationship with your players and creating the right atmosphere.

- My private life, I prefer to have that private.
- If I am going to write a book, which I have done, I think we have to get it right - whatever has been written about me, about football, about my private life.
- I must say, the standard of football we play in League Two is better than I thought. I think, if you compared it with the fourth division in other countries, such as Italy, Germany and Spain, League Two is much, much better - and that's very positive. The intensity and the tempo is as high as the Premier League.
- Italian football in the eighties and nineties was the most beautiful league in the world. The hardest, most beautiful of all.
- Yes, England lost to Iceland at Euro 2016 but you need to look at what Iceland had, as well as what England didn't. Maybe Iceland were not technically strong but they looked very strong together and England were not the only ones surprised by them.
- Serie A was the best league in the world when Roma offered me the job of manager in 1984.

- You don't criticise Totti in Italy. There might have been reasons to, sometimes, but you don't touch him.
- If you want to keep up with the changes, then you have to watch as much football as you can. Live is the best way but also on television. All the best teams: Barcelona, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and now City. What are they doing? If possible, go and see them training. You can always learn.
- I know Mourinho very well. He has a very strong mentality and is very peculiar man.
- By April 1998, the fortunes of Lazio were on the rise as they won their first trophy in 24 years. Meanwhile, my salary of around Â£400,000 basically tripled overnight when TV companies started paying for rights to broadcast games.
- I met Ulrika Jonsson on December 8, 2001, at some party hosted by the Daily Express, or maybe it was the Daily Star.

- The pressure on the English national team has always been very big at all the big tournaments.
- Shanghai is a beautiful city, with theatres, shopping malls and restaurants that can rival anything in London.

- England was the biggest coaching job that I had. You know, in England, the football is connected to all the things in a incredible way. I'm very proud to have been there.
- Sir Alex Ferguson must be very high up on the list of greatest managers ever. Then there is Fabio Capello, and people forget how much Giovanni Trapattoni achieved at Inter and especially Juventus.

- Football is beautiful and cruel.
- The treatment of Wayne Rooney told me something about the way England fans view the national team.
- My private life has absolutely nothing to do with my football.
- Sir Alex Ferguson was a genuinely nice man. We met many times and even had dinner together on a few occasions. But woe to the person who threatened or bothered Manchester United in any way. Then Ferguson would not spare his venom. I know, because he often aimed that venom at me.
- Ranieri won the Premier League and no one would've expected that.
- I think if you want be a big team and stay a big team, it costs money. Whether you like it or not, it doesn't matter.

- Sometimes I thought that maybe it would have been better to stay in Italy, to stay at Lazio.
- Before England, I had never been sacked in my life.
- My second year in Rome was very good. Back then, a striker was a striker. Strikers scored goals; they didn't defend. Today this is normal, but it wasn't at that time. If you wanted to play my style of football you couldn't have old players or famous players who were unwilling to do the job both ways: attacking and also defending.
- When we fail at something it's because it needs work.
- Scholes was England's best football player. He had everything except the ability to tackle without earning a yellow card. It was impossible to take the ball from him, and he never mishit a pass.
- My role as Manchester City manager was different to being manager of clubs in other countries. You share responsibility more in other European countries. You have the last word, though, in who to buy and who plays and things like that.

- Paul Scholes was at home on a cold February day away to Newcastle.
- When I was at Shanghai SIPG, I had the Brazilian player Hulk, who had joined for over Â£50 million from Zenit St Petersburg. He had no problems with life in China - his only problem was that he got injured on his debut and was out for two months after that. But I never heard him complain about life in China at all - everything else was good.
- My private life was not very private in England.
- Premier League is one thing. World Cup is totally different.

- When you go to a World Cup, the whole nation should be behind the team - and then the team have to play their part, too.
- I think, that it's sort of a dream, for many coaches to have a long contract with African countries. The problem in Africa, they do the qualifiers with some coaches, and when the World Cup comes, they change to have bigger names. And then, they recruit a coach for two, three months and when the World Cup finish, they send him back.
- How many Messis do you have in India if they had the chance to play?
- To be a manager, you have to perform always. You cannot live in history. It's now and tomorrow that counts.
- Sometimes things go wrong in 'football. You can lose games, own-goals, you can buy the wrong players. But you do it in the right spirit and you do it honestly. That is not how it went wrong at Notts County.
- I liked friendly games, but I took them like a test to test new players. People didn't like that very much.
- No woman was good enough for me, according to my mother.
- I have two great children, even if they don't live with me.
- I would certainly never walk past a player in the corridor and not speak. Why should I do that? They have to play for you so of course I would speak to them. If you want them to do everything they can for you, then you have to treat them with respect.
- The player picked as No 23 in the squad will not win the World Cup for you.
- Over time I realised that the most important thing is not the system but the players you have. Then you make a system for them.
- I thought I was prepared for England but I was not prepared for things outside football, my private life. I am not very proud that fans could probably name three of my former girlfriends. I don't think it damaged my football results. But my image outside football it damaged, yes.
- The truth is that I never cared about money. Not one bit.
- China, if they decide to do something, they do it. Not only in football but whatever it is. If you think about the billion population, there must be Messis or Ronaldos out there. There must be many talented football players out there.
