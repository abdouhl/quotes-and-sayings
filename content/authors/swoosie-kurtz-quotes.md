- Working with a great director is like getting a master class in acting.
- I am heartbroken that this movie would cause anyone pain. It should be a source of joy. The story is a metaphor about how we try to stay in our own little bubbles, we don't let life in, we don't take the journey.
- It's so funny whenever things come full circle.
- It's great that I don't have to apologize about being over 26.
- My heart was beating out of my chest.
- I'd love to do a musical. I have a little list of them in my head.
- I love to be directed, and I can glean something from almost anyone.
- I think these are terrible times to be anything in.
- The first thing I ask when I'm offered a part is, Who's the director? which is something they never understand in Los Angeles.
- I keep both of my Tonys on my mantle. They're in front of a mirror so if you look at just the right angle, it looks like I have four!
- To me, getting notes, honing the part, and refining the role is the real fun of the play.
