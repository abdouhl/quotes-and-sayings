- Compliments aren't really a journalistic angle.
- At every premiere, I stand in the back, I never sit, worrying. And then maybe I hear them laugh or whatever, and the muscles unclench a little. But always, I feel like it's a fluke, that I'll never be able to do it again.
- For reasons which I can't logically explain, in all of the films I've done, I've ended up doing love stories of one kind or another, and it seems to me that love stories are extremely dependent on the obstacles you can place between the lovers. There is no love story without it.

- I don't know what the creative process is. I don't know how to trick it into starting or how to egg it on.
- I learned everything, right or wrong, about honor and love, all those things, when I was a kid watching movies. I learned as much there as I did from my parents or my schooling or anything else.
- The essence to me of all good drama is argument.
- With a movie you're creating from the beginning this particular work, let's not call it work of art, because very few movies are works of art, let's just call them bits of popular culture, whatever they are, sometimes very rarely by accident a movie becomes a work of art.
- It's my job to motivate the audience to believe. I have to get them to suspend their judgment in favor of involvement.
- Stars are like thoroughbreds. Yes, it's a little more dangerous with them. They are more temperamental. You have to be careful because you can be thrown. But when they do what they do best - whatever it is that's made them a star - it's really exciting.
- For example, a man who might not have enormous charisma, who could be president 40 years ago, and who was a deserving president, I don't know that George Washington would be a president today, I don't know that Abe Lincoln would, I don't know that Roosevelt would.
- When you rehearse a play, you spend four weeks with one goal in mind - to wean the actor away from you. You want the actor to become completely independent and to understand all the emotional and psychological moves within the character.
- All the movies I've made are essentially character-driven movies about people that I'm interested in.
- I mean, certainly writing, painting, photography, dance, architecture, there is an aspect of almost every art form that is useful and that merges into film in some way.
- I've produced my own films for twenty years now - it means I have to talk to less people.
- I will not ever say that it's good to start with too little preparation, because that's patently not true. But I don't rehearse the way a lot of directors do, to stage a scene in terms of manners and attitudes and lock them in.
- You have to go by your instincts in casting.
- South Bend is a nice town, but you know that phrase - 'I was homesick even when I was home.'
- At some point during the filmmaking process, you lose objectivity, and you need the eyes of someone who understands the process and has been in the trenches.
- When you first start out, you want to be Fellini, or you want to be Bergman.
- By the time I'm done with a project, it's taken so long that I usually don't even like it anymore. I only see the things I wish I'd done differently.
- In terms of level of difficulty, it would go comedy, thriller, and then romantic drama.
- And I taught acting for years, and without knowing it that was the real thing that started bending me toward directing.
- But, I've made films in Japan, in Yugoslavia, all over Europe, all over the United States, Mexico, but not Hollywood.
- Even if it's a thriller or a comedy, it's always a love story for me, and that's what I concentrate on, because the love stories are my surrogates for the argument: two people in conflict that see life differently.
- What's overwhelmingly clear is 'Havana' didn't work for people, but why it didn't work I don't feel I can put my finger on in a way I can learn from.
- Well, the wonderful thing about making movies, oddly enough, is that they're sort of highly motivated graduate studies in one or another field.
- I didn't grow up thinking of movies as film, or art, but as movies, something to do on a Saturday afternoon.
- Good actors aren't enough. You need charisma. Can you imagine 'Casablanca' without Bogart and Bergman?
- I didn't believe that I'd ever be lucky enough to be able to make a living as an actor.
- You know, essentially when you do a play you're reinterpreting a work of art that already exists. That's not what happens with a movie.
- My strength is with actors. I think I'm good at working with them to get the best performances, at seeing what it is that they have and that the story needs.
- No country could claim to be civilized if its legal system weren't available to everyone in it.
- Like a lot of New Yorkers, I assumed that I knew all about the U.N. I was shocked to find out it's not like anything I had in mind. There are only six languages accepted there. It's considered international territory.
- The problem with filming something is that we struggle desperately to make three dimensions out of two dimensions. It can't be done.
- When I work, I think mainly in terms of dramatic choices.
- Making a movie is a network of decisions that keep multiplying as you go. You leave a trail of decisions behind you, and that's how you start to see the shape of what you've done. When you get far enough, you turn around and say, 'Ha, that's the movie.' It's only then that you find out if it's going to work or not.
- American movies are the most popular movies everywhere, and it is true that the quality is far from uniformly terrific.
- If you have a career like mine, which is so identified with Hollywood, with big studios and stars, you wonder if maybe you shouldn't go off and do what the world thinks of as more personal films with lesser-known people. But I think I've fooled everybody. I've made personal films all along. I just made them in another form.
- By that I mean, I think that it is true that politics and political heroes have to satisfy our need to be greater than mortal in some way, and that's led them into creating illusions, sound bites, focus groups that tell you what to do.
- Beginnings and endings are not interesting; audiences want the high point, which means you've got to get to it and get to it now - get the gun out fast, the clothes off quick.

- I do not have a good control of running sight gags. I laugh like hell when I see them, but I don't know how to invent those jokes.
- I think a lot of creative people are uncomfortable with therapy. Because you're basically trying to 'solve' the unconscious. And the unconscious is where it all comes from.
- This thing called chemistry, which I can't define and wouldn't know how to, either works or it doesn't. Sometimes a love story can involve very talented actors, but we are not invested emotionally in whether they end up together.
- Even with 'Three Days of the Condor,' I wanted to do a thriller. But I was still concentrating on the Faye Dunaway-Robert Redford relationship in that film.
- I fly an aeroplane, and I think a lot about how much I do not want ever to run into an optimistic air traffic controller. I just don't. I want a guy down there who's just waiting for the worst crash possible and petrified that it's going to happen on his watch. And then I feel safe flying into his territory.

- I do have a responsibility, but I would make the most boring films in the world if I woke up every morning worrying about my social responsibility.
- I am not a farceur. I am not Blake Edwards.

- There are very few Westerns that have ever made really giant money.
- I'm not a writer myself, so I'm forced to try to get what's a sort of an odour or a colour or something I feel in my head from a writer, and that's a... I don't have a recipe for that process. I don't know what it is... it's different every time.
- I haven't broken any new ground in the form of a film.
- Burt Lancaster was largely responsible for me becoming a director.

- I love having made a movie.
- You're fighting a losing battle if you expect the people who own the studios to make moral choices.

- If I want to make people moved or cry in a film, I figure out what the room looks like, what the people are wearing, what time of day it is, what the light is, how to photograph it, where to put the camera. It involves optics and costume design and set design and architecture.
- I think it's a terrible shame that politics has become show business.
- I personally have never made a movie in Hollywood, because I don't want to get up in my own bed and then go to the movie set, and then come home at night to my real life.
- It doesn't matter what I'm doing - I wish it was something else. If I'm producing, I wish I was directing. If I'm directing, I wish I was doing almost anything else!
- I learned that creativity is all about being frustrated.
- When you're shooting a feature that costs $200,000 a day with a crew of 250, you don't want accidents; you want to know exactly what's going to happen. But with a documentary, you don't, so you have to be sensitive to accidents because that is where the gold is.

- When you make a film you usually make a film about an idea.
- We talked about Tootsie, the idea in Tootsie is that a man becomes a better man for having been a woman.
- People ask me over and over how is it that I work with stars. How do you work with Barbra Streisand, with Paul Newman, with Al Pacino, with Sally Field, Jane Fonda, you work with all these people. Isn't this a problem? And it isn't a problem at all. It's terrific. It's great fun. And I don't know what the answer is.
- You are not an active creator of the film.
- What makes architecture extraordinary is that you're looking at the building, but your peripheral vision is also seeing how it fits within a space. And it's seeing more than one part of the building at one time.
- I guess all my films are about resolving conflicts - and they're all love stories. If they weren't, I couldn't make them.
- It's a terrible mistake when it gets to be a contest of egos. The actor is always going to win. If a director gets into a control situation and is overbearing, it's deadly.

- I really think that people never go wrong by telling the truth.

- Even in 'Victor/Victoria,' there was talk about what it means to be a woman, what it means to be a man. You didn't get that in the old days, in 'Charley's Aunt' or 'Some Like It Hot.'
- The very reasons sometimes that you make a film are the reasons for its failure.
- If you list the qualities that we consider feminine, they are patience, understanding, empathy, supportiveness, a desire to nurture. Our culture tells us those are feminine traits, but they're really just human.
