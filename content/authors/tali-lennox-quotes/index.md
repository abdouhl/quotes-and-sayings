- Let's be honest: the label of model-daughter-of-celebrity mother is... you know, I don't want to have that label. It's not who I am. It's not my values to go off someone else's name and to be pigeonholed as that. So in a way, that has really pushed me to be more independent.
- I work hard at what I do, and it does take time and a lot of commitment, so for me, it is proving to other people that I'm not just another dummy.
- I don't want to do things because it will please other people. I'm not doing this to get fame or any attention. I try to be selective about who I get advice from. I would like to contribute to the art world, but, you know, you can't plan these things.
- I realize how myself and other people have started to almost fool ourselves that it's more important to us and more real than the real world, the offline world, and we value looking at our phone and pixels on a screen more than connecting eye to eye with a human being, which is terrifying to me because we're becoming robots.
- I can sometimes feel like I'm an aggressive man inside. I'm not going to show that on social media.
- I get a lot of people that say, 'You know what, I heard that you're a painter, and I thought, 'Oh, another model who is saying she's an artist.' They assumed it was going to be a few splashes on a canvas.
- I'm in a really nice position because I can be selective with the modeling jobs that I do and just work with brands I'm passionate about. The two worlds balance out nicely for me because modeling is so social - it has travel, you meet people, it's extroverted. Whereas painting is very solitary - when I paint, I'm kind of in my own world.
- I want to be a female artist who is honest. I want to encourage other girls to be honest with who they are and not try to be picture perfect, because it's a woman's imperfections that make her perfect anyway.
- I never had an ambition to go into modeling, originally. I still can't believe how quickly it all took off.
- If I stayed in London, I probably would have gotten more work. I've never wanted to be thought of as an 'It' girl, someone who rides on the coattails of my mother.
- I Skype my mum every day. Everyone in my family does creative things, so it's nice to have that support.
- I'm quite a precious painter; my style is a messy fine art - sort of impressionist. I do portraits, I love painting other artists, but recently, I've been playing around with self portraits, putting on different characters.
- Sometimes I feel like a man; sometimes I feel like a child.
- I haven't been to Berlin Fashion Week before, but it's really on the up. Being an artist as well as a model, I know that the art world is booming here, so it makes sense that fashion would feel that effect, too.
- There are times when I love the world and love everyone, and I want to talk to everyone, and other times when I feel really disillusioned, and like none of this is real, nothing is real around me.
- I love talking to people, hearing people's stories; I love honest things.
- I'm aware that given what I've done in the past - and having a well-known parent - that people will be very quick to judge my path more than others, but I have to just not care.
- I like to do really realistic paintings, which requires so much focus; like, if I have to go to the bathroom or change a song, I can't; I'm so in it.
- Art is subjective. I'm not looking for people's praise.
