- I've got to tell you, I'm not really a tie man. I'll wear a tie if I have to: If I'm standing in the dock and it looks like I'm facing 20 years, then I'll definitely wear the tie!
- There is an old saying that you're a product of your environment. Parents can only do so much when eight hours of the day is spent at school. As parents, we try to teach our kids to be respectful to others and teach them old values, but a lot of it is down to the schools.
- Kids will come into my boxing gym with no discipline, and then you teach them how to focus and love what they're doing, which then travels outside into their home and work life.
- I wasn't very good at school and couldn't get my head round it.
- The worst thing people ever say is that 'I can't afford to have kids!' It's selfish, and what infuriates me is when people say they can't do stuff they like go on holidays and buy cars when they have kids. You can - you find the money, you've just got to work harder for it.
- If you're going to buy a suit, don't buy one off the peg if you can afford not to. Go to a tailor, as I always do; find the style you like, and have it fitted to your shape.
- People sometimes wear shirts that are really boxy, and you can see them over the top of their trousers, which doesn't look right to me.
- I always judge a man by his shoes and his watch.
