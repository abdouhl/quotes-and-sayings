- Why is partying and having a good time bad?
- I just couldn't live without dogs.

- People think I am America's party girl, which is just stupid. I have done 24 movies and I am creating my own TV show.

- I like when a guy makes me feel like a woman and a little girl at the same time.
- I'm more of a jeans and T-shirt kind of girl.
- The next step in my life is hopefully meeting a nice guy and getting married.

- I just started making Bloody Marys. I always thought they looked gross, then I tasted one. There's an art to it, from the Tabasco to the Worcestershire.
