- I'm really into Greek yogurt, fruit and almonds. Those are my 'go-to' snacks.
- I don't have a connection to the fashion world at all.
- Be yourself. You're okay. And it really doesn't matter what other people think.
- In school, I was playing old men and women, babies, Russian people, and all sorts of weird parts - a lot of comedy - and that's sort of like home to me.
- Honestly, all the sweets and bad stuff on set don't really call to me because I'm working so much. I've trained myself to stay away from sugar.
- I love Ben Affleck so much. He's an amazing director.
- 'The Notebook' is one of my favorite love stories.
- I have learned to take the part of me that is very fearful and work on that. There is space for that in my life. I have learned to give myself a bit more freedom between 'action' and 'cut.' I come by all that fear honestly, like most humans have. I can't bring it with me to work, so in that way, the work feels quite liberating.
- On a film set, for me, there's so much more time to process what's going on than there is on a television set. There's more wiggle room to try things and fail and try again and get to the heart of what's going on in the scene, which is really fun for me. It's what I like to do.
- Whatever it is that I am working on is what I become obsessed with.
- I'd love to do theater. I've done so many plays in my life. I still think of that as my main thing.
- So often, we're expected to maintain some sort of standard - that won't get you where you need to go. One of the most daring things I've done is drop out of graduate school. I had no job, but something inside me was saying, 'Go! Be in the world!' I had to listen to myself, and it worked out. I still think, 'Who was that girl?'
- I am very interested in Ayurvedic medicine and hope to explore it more someday. I only have a very superficial understanding of the whole thing right now. But learning what my body type is has shifted my whole self-care regime a bit, and I feel better because of it.
- For me as an actor, daring is to tell the truth - to be yourself, no matter how the world interacts with that.
- I didn't spend a lot of time with prison guards, but my father was an assistant district attorney for a long time so I was always hearing stories about prisoners and prison guards.
- I'm a tall woman. At work, that means a lot of my co-stars have to stand next to me on apple crates. But apparently, my height bodes well in the fashion world.
- I started doing yoga in college, so that has just become a staple of a self-care routine for my mind and my body. My body craves it at this point, so I do it two to three times a week, sometimes more. I practice Vinyasa style yoga and sometimes mix it up.
- I try to come at fitness and nutrition from a perspective of gentleness and what will make me feel good afterwards. I try to stay out of the mindset of needing to fix myself. I do whatever seems fun to me.
- I don't do detoxes or cleanses; they don't really work for me.
- I love children. I just don't know if I'm ready to have kids. I feel like I have more time. Kids are cute, you know? They need a lot of help - that's the thing.
- As an actor, what I'm finding is that I really like the extremes. I think that's really fun to play with.
- Coffee makes me go crazy.
- I definitely felt by the time I got to grad school - which was a great experience - I was like, 'What's the difference between the teachers and the students? Why are the teachers teachers if they want to be acting?' It didn't make sense to me anymore. It's not like you learn how to set a broken bone and you get the stamp of approval.
- I actually like pole dancing! It gives you so much confidence. I never thought I'd do it, but now I'm really into it.
- I don't know my armpit from my elbow in Los Angeles.
- I don't do detoxes or cleanses - they don't really work for me. I have a really moderate, simple routine. I like to do yoga, Pilates, dance, and things like that.
- I try not to eat too many raw vegetables. I only have one raw meal a day. At night I eat warm, cooked foods. I like to drink lots of tea, but no coffee. Not drinking coffee has changed my game for the better.
- Life is so much easier when I allow myself to be myself and go with the flow. Whatever that looks like on a given day. If I can get quiet enough to truly check-in with myself, I usually end up on the right track.
- I had a teacher in college who drastically changed the course of my life by telling me that he believed in me as an actor. I never received that support before, and it inspired to me to such a degree that I never looked back. He taught me that it's okay to be crappy; it's okay to fight; it's okay to go to any length.
- My guilty pleasure is I like to watch a lot of HGTV. I really like watching design shows about houses, like extreme homes. Like buying a bridge and turning it into a house or something like that. I really am interested in home design or something like that... architecture.
- I don't like it when people don't hold the door. I don't know, that really bugs me... I guess I like manners.
- I'm the girl who will show up in jeans no matter what - but the jeans can get fancier and fancier.
- I'm not very cool. I have a really hard time meeting people and stuff.
- Massages are my favorite. Sometimes just getting myself outside for a walk if I'm really busy can be an indulgence. I love taking naps. I love to stay up too late with close friends. I believe in everything in moderation. I take what I like and leave what I don't.
- I tried to hostess... but they fired me after four days because I couldn't figure out how seating plans worked.
- If it's a good day, I get 'The New York Times' on my iPad, and if I have a little time in the morning, I like to look at that while I'm eating.
- I wanted to wear a uniform when I was in high school, but I couldn't. I was like, 'It would be so much easier!'
- I like to do yoga, Pilates, dance, and things like that.
- I know what feels good to eat and what doesn't. I try to err on the side of choices I know will leave me feeling more energized and ready to go, because it's always better to feel healthy.
- There's nothing that's in an actor's control. I've learned at this point you do things and you let them go. There's no way to control the outcome. The only thing I have any sort of reign over is my own experience.
