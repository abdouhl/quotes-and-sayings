- When I was a Laker Girl, I only danced for three months. We did not get paid that much money, and I was working two jobs at the time. I thought that it would be a little more fun, but it was quite stressful. It's all about your weight, your hair, having the right hair extensions, what to wear, the kind of shoes you wore.
- When I was, like, 16, I went in to the head of Disney, and I hadn't taken acting class really at all, and I didn't know what I was doing, and it was really embarrassing. Of course, you think Disney wants over-the-top and funny, and I was just trying to be over-the-top and funny, and it just wasn't working, and that was the worst.
- I used to work at this store, and I got fired when I actually booked the job on 'Glee' because I had to go film 'Glee.' I was a dancer on 'Glee.' My manager was like, 'Umm this isn't gonna work, so you can come get your last check this week.'
- I'm trying to be more organized, put together, and be more kind to myself. I'm really hard on myself and really just self-critical and always striving for this perfection which doesn't exist.
- I like being able to play women that are growing or aren't easy to love. Maybe they are really likable, but they're annoying because they're not tapping into who they're suppose to be. You're watching them, and you're like, 'Oh, why does she keep making this decision?'
- I try not to read the stuff online because it's so hurtful and stuff. There was somebody that said I was messing up my genetics by dating my boyfriend because he's not black. It was an interesting thing to read.
- For me, I worked so hard to get to where I am and I don't ever want to lose sight of being grounded.
- I've had a few encounters: At a restaurant, this woman that was like, 'Oh my God, oh my God, can we take a picture with you? My son said not to, but I just had to. You my favorite 'Devils Girl!'
- I haven't gotten a lot of feedback about, 'Oh, you helped me in this way.' But on social media, people are like, 'Thank you for your positive posts,' or 'It's fun to see you grow and your character. I feel like I'm growing with you.'
- I happen to be half West Indian, but I don't know that side of my family.
- I feel like you are doing better for the world if you're honoring you because everything is getting the authentic you.
- I've done tons of Debbie Allen musicals. I was a dancer in 'Glee,' and I was a Laker girl for three months.
