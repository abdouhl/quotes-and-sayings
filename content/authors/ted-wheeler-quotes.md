- This is part of the core media strategy out of Trump's White House: to use federal troops to bolster his sagging poll data. And it is an absolute abuse of federal law enforcement officials.
- The tactics that the Trump administration are using on the streets of Portland are abhorrent. People are being literally scooped off the street into unmarked vans, rental cars, apparently. They are being denied probable cause. And they are denied due process. They don't even know who's pulling them into the vans.
- My fight isn't with Charlie Hales. My fight is with the problems he has failed to address as mayor.
