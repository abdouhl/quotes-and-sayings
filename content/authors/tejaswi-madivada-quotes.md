- I have become so strong now that rumors, abuses or trolls don't bother me anymore.

- I've stopped reading news and even in the movies and web-series I watch, I'm ensuring that I'm watching only positive stuff.
- Ram Gopal Varma saw my pictures and called me for a meeting. He signed me on to play Vishnu Manchu's wife in one of his movies. He did not give me dialogues, instead he asked, 'What will you do if you were Vishnu's wife and this is the scene?' He explained the scene and I gave my inputs.
- I don't like the concept of crackers. Diwali is a festival of lights but we have a lot of sound too. I don't know how and why. It isn't good for Mother Earth especially the animals around.

- I'm not looking for any particular genre or role because I will pick up a role based on my mood and instinct.
- I was always fascinated by the stand-up comedy shows from my childhood.

- Ever since I discovered this place, it was always my dream to do a 'princess' photoshoot here at Chowmahalla Palace.
- Since I was part of the St. Francis College basketball team, I used to get the opportunity to go to various parts of the city for tournaments. It's during one such outing that I figured this is the Chowmahalla Palace! I still remember buying a ticket and getting into the palace with my team, all of us in our sports uniform.
- I like hugging, holding hands or monkeying around with the people I like. That's my way of letting them know I like the them.
- So I want to make it clear that I want to be an actress and do versatile roles. I am only trying to bring out the actor in me.
- But I've always admired Tamil and Malayalam films, and language isn't a barrier for me.

- I would rather be single than be someone's girlfriend because that's not my identity.
- 'Ice Cream' is a very different horror thriller. Something unusual and super natural happens to two persons in a house and I am sure that those scenes will definitely scare the audiences.
- Well to me Bigg Boss just reiterated that TV is not reality and reality is not easy.
- Popularity is the last thing I want.
- I would watch several English comedy shows and I have always wanted to be a part of one.

- I've been very interested in dance from my childhood and I used to teach dance to some students.
- If believe if you've found a guy, you should give your 100 percent. But being single is the best thing in the world. I will be single as long as I can.
- I don't want a boyfriend. I want a friend with whom I can be myself.
- Not married, not planning to also.
- I still can't believe I acted in Ram Gopal Varma's direction.
- I was dating someone and wanted to get married to him. But just because casting couch exists in TFI and I work here, he didn't respect me.
- To me 'love' is not just marriage and kids. It is companionship.
- Once you eat, talk, share, sleep, wake-up with the same people, you tend to form bonds.
- I overcame all the casting couches and stood out strongly as an independent woman.
- I got offered to do an OTT film with Nawazuddin Siddiqui two years ago that I was uncomfortable doing because it had a nude scene. I was asked why I can't do it again if I did it before, many didn't realize I've actually never gone nude for 'Ice Cream,' it was just a publicity gimmick.
- I think the pollution due to crackers is coming down every year. I hope more people join in towards celebrating a non-polluted and eco-friendly Diwali.
