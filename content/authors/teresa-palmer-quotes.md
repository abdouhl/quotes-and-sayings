- I'd always dreamt of acting but, in Adelaide, we don't have exposure to the opportunities that make stardom a possibility.
- I've been incredibly blessed.
- I try to get back to Australia as much as possible.
- I know my parents are really proud of me, and they think I've become successful, so that's nice, but there's still so much I want to achieve in my life.

- In real life, I'm always in tracksuits, and I never wear makeup.
- Obviously I don't have a stylist for everyday stuff, but for a premiere or something usually the studio will hire someone.

- I haven't met everyone from all different cultures, but I do know Aussies are very tough.
- I do like fantasy films.
- I always have those feelings - lucky and blessed - and I don't know if they'll ever go away. I really hope they don't, as I think it keeps you grounded. That's how I feel about every film I do.

- I can walk around relatively anonymously.
- I'm very much into animal welfare.
- I came from rather humble beginnings.
- I was thrown in the deep end at 18 when I got cast in a movie that I didn't audition for. The director just sort of found me and put me in a film, so the decision was really made for me.
- As a producer you have creative control, and that's what is so exciting about it. At the end of the day, if you have made a film it's totally your responsibility, and if it works it's your responsibility and if it doesn't it's also your responsibility.

- I think, for me anyway, music and film is where you can really transport yourself to another universe.

- I love zombie films like Danny Boyle's '28 Days Later' - I thought it was so brilliantly done and so grounded in reality. I was definitely thrust into the zombie world watching that film.
- I had the best of both worlds when I was a kid. I'd spend a quiet week with my mum, then I'd go to my dad's property in the Adelaide Hills, where there were all these kids and animals running around.
- I'm a workaholic, I always try to fill my time with projects.
- There aren't a lot of movie star males around my age that I can play opposite.
