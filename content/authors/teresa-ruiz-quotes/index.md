- I think I want to do something about family or love or romance.
- The Actors Studio continues to open its doors to any artist in search for growth. I would especially like to see more young Latin talents try out. We need more of you prepared and ready!
- Especially women, we can relate to wanting to have a seat at the table and a lot of the time it's not even to be more powerful than the men, it's not even to be powerful, it's just to feel that we're not going to be undermined, that our ideas are not going to be taken for granted, that we won't be sexually harassed.
- Isabella is a woman who kind of walks on a tightrope. She walks on that tightrope because in the 'Narcos' society that she was born in, it reflects all of the cultural things that society imposes.
- But the thing about 'Narcos' is that in the end, evil does not prevail. In the end, ambition destroys everything that you worked to build and it's not just in the show but in history.
- My days at the Studio sustain all the work that I do today. They gave me a sense of legacy, a sense of belonging, and a community that made me believe in my talent and vocation.
- It turned out that those years I was at the Studio were the last years that Mr. Landau was alive and teaching. They were also the last years of some of the greatest teachers that have walked the earth. I got to hear the advice of Charlie Laughton, Mark Rydell, and Penny Allen.
- 'Narcos' moves so fast, and the war on drugs is just so vast, and there are so many things you can focus on.
- Also, what I like about it is that the villains in 'Narcos' are not just only the drug dealers, but it also poses the question of what part does the government have in the problem, and the corruption in it? I think it's a very important question to ask as a society.
- I'm not very good at working indoors.
- I think we're still learning how to write roles for women with power.
- I'm like a man in that way. I can only do one thing at a time, haha.
- It was my mother's dream to have a few houses next door to each other, where they could live in one, and my brother and I could live in the others, where we are close but also had independence.
- As a young actress, I started out acting in beautiful independent movies in Mexico.
- And one way that many women can feel like they're more protected is to be successful on their own, to be financially and socially independent, and that way they're not going to be relying on the will of men.
