- I feel like I've accomplished all my fantasies and childhood dreams. I had nothing; now I have everything.
- I love to run. I feel free and complete. The feeling of moving fast is just magical; it's wonderful.
- I said I wanted to be the best in the world. I thought if I could make it, I would be able to change my future, to change my destiny. I would push myself to the limits. I would do 70 laps and barely eat.
- I've done specific work to take care of anxiety. I believe that the psychological side can work for you just as it can against you. The better your command is over the psychological aspect, the better your physical performance. There's no other way.
