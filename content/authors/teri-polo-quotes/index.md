- I became disillusioned with dance when I was 16 and started focusing on acting.
- It's my favorite role - being a mom.
- I love New York. I was in New York at the age of 13, at the School of American Ballet, walking around the subways in my little bunhead and thinking I was so cool.
- There are people who fly to the height of stardom in a single day, and then there are people like me. I used to have this ridiculous idea that I absolutely had to be a big, big movie star. Now all I'm after is happiness.
- I moved to New York between my junior and senior years of high school to just see what it was like, to go to a modeling agency and see how to get representation.
- I once said to someone, 'If I could shave my head and wear no makeup and get a part just on my talent, I would be the happiest person in the world.'
- My husband and I went to Bald Head Island for our four-year anniversary. We spent the night in bed with champagne, tequila and Krispy Kreme doughnuts and watched a boxing match on Showtime.
- I'm considering getting married again. I've not lost faith in that institution. I'm older; I'm smarter. I'm no longer searching for something to complete me... and therefore I'm now able to find someone to be a partner with.
- I want to do things - scuba diving, sky diving, seeing the world. I'm an avid supporter of living life to its fullest and not always waiting for tomorrow.
- Dance is a very disciplining career or hobby. I was disciplined at an early age.
- I love New York. I love the people. I love the anonymity.
- I will read four or five books at the same time.
- Actually, I think I'm funnier off-camera.
- In Hollywood, most things are based on looks, so I'd love to do something that has nothing to do with how I look.
- In some instances, I don't care what people think. In other instances, I do - especially because of the stereotype. People take a look at me and say, 'She's cute. She's blond. She's an actress. She's a bimbo.' You know? So I take great pains to show I'm intelligent, to show I'm not a twinkie.
- I never got picked on, but I never had a lot of friends. When I talked to my parents about it, they said, 'They're just jealous because you're beautiful and talented.' It was probably one of the worst things they could have told me, because I became self-conscious.
