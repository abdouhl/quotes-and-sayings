- I'm too busy playing to worry about the movement or the fingerboard.
- After The Ventures I dug Johnny Smith quite a bit.
- But then there was Hendrix, man. Jimi was really the last cat to freak me. Jimi was playing all the stuff I had in my head. I couldn't believe it, when I first heard him. Man, no one can ever do what he did with a guitar. No one can ever take his place.

- About the only other thing I'd want would be a wider neck. My fingers are so fat that sometimes I deaden the string next to the one I'm fretting.
- Well, first I'd want a better vibrato.
- I just get all jacked up when we start cooking.
- Sometimes I'll be playing along and find I'm missing the strings. I'll worry about it for days until I notice that the pick has worn down to half its size.
