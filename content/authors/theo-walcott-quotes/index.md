- The Champions League is massive. I've had so much experience. I'm only 23, and yet I've played so much in the Champions League, and not many players my age would have had that experience.
- A golf holiday with the guys is always nice. I'm a bit of a bandit on the golf course because I play with a handicap of 10, but I should be lower than that.
- I played golf in Dubai with my cousin and brother, but I wouldn't do it again because I was dripping with sweat in the heat and wasn't able to last the whole round.

- My friend Adam gave me my first chance to play in an organised match, for Steventon, when I was 10. The team were one player short, and I joined in. I had never played before, but I came on and scored a perfect hat-trick: header, left foot, right foot.

- Football is about opinions, but love me or hate me, I don't really care. I genuinely wouldn't change anything. I don't have any regrets.
- I like going to New York because I don't get recognised there - although, the first time I was there, I'd only been in the city an hour when the tallest guy came up to me on Fifth Avenue and said my name, gave me a high-five, and then just walked off.
- The problem with my shoulders was something I inherited from my dad. The left one would pop out and then pop back in - absolute agony - during almost every game last season, so I had surgery to put it right last summer.
- Why can you not enjoy scoring and celebrating a goal for your new team with your fans? They have travelled all that way; enjoy it - simple as that. Some players choose not to, and that's fine, but it's just who I am - celebrate scoring goals. It's a great feeling.

- It can't be too bad being one of the top goalscorers at Arsenal in the Premier League, mainly as a winger as well, and three FA Cups.
