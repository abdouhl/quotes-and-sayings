- I generally won't give importance to language barriers. If I feel an actor will fit into the role I will approach.
- I like to be in that space, the same middle-class man. Otherwise, you become completely detached from reality.
- I go for actors who do precisely what is expected of them.
- I like films and I have been watching films from a young age. So, making films happened to be a natural progression.
- Aaranya Kaandam' is not the biography or history of a gangster but a page out of the life of a gangster. It is like a day in his life.
- Even though 'Aaranya Kaandam' wasn't successful or seen by many people, it has an aura around it. It's a false aura, but it has helped me get things done.
- Gangster films are exciting.
- I'm not making movies for kids or family audiences.
- I've been trying to write since 1998 after dropping out of Visual Communication from Loyola. My parents have been supportive.
- Mostly, I am waiting. Got to finish the edit, I am waiting. Dubbing must get over, I am waiting. Waiting for shoot. Waiting for the set. When you are waiting, your mind isn't relaxed enough to watch a film.
- Once you create a believable fictional universe, you suck the audiences into that world and they tag along for the ride.
- Usually, when I am not working, I mostly hang out with my friends, ride my bike, listen to music, and, occasionally, watch movies.
- The pleasure for me is in the writing process, which has its own challenges.
- I am inspired by Indian mythology.
- I'm a huge fan of Doordarshan, so my influences range from international to local.
- The 'Mahabharata' is the best story ever. It makes you believe that impossible things can be made possible. There is magical realism.
- We all make films to be hits.
- I watched 'Disco Dancer' when I was very young. I have always loved its songs.
- The pivotal scene in 'AK,' where Jackie Shroff 's character Singaperumal parades around his room in the buff, is a metaphor for his false sense of prde and arrogance.
- Aaranya Kaandam' is a term from the Ramayana. It means Jungle Chapter but apart from the term, I haven't borrowed anything else. The characters are as good or as bad as the common man.
- No matter how many films a filmmaker makes, there would be very few films that are truly great, where he has got everything right.
- It is up to the directors to take risks in telling a story and if they want to experiment, they should work with the right kind of people.
- We make movies to be watched in theatres. Online streaming is more of a bonus, to revisit the film.
- There's nothing Vijay Sethupathi can't pull off, right?
- Nothing is right and nothing is wrong in life.
- It is their job as actors to play different people. Should only a doctor play a doctor's role?
- I like strong women. Strong women characters have always existed in the movies of directors such as K. Balachander and Mani Ratnam.
- I did not fix any genre for 'AK.' We just write a story and audience will put it in a genre as they perceive it.
- If I have to name someone who is responsible for me coming to films, it is Ilayaraja's music. From a young age, I've been a huge fan of his music. Because of that, I studied Visual Communication.
- When I write a story or think of a scene, I always play some song in the background. Sometimes when I don't add a song at the writing stage, I do it while editing the film.
- Even if you come up with a conventional script, directors face several issues in convincing people to get on board.
- I am totally inspired by 'Godfather,' one of the greatest films made. Also, I am fascinated by the thought of how someone becomes a gangster and continues to be one.
- If the film succeeds at the box office it is a commercial film. Otherwise it isn't.
- Because hardly anyone has seen 'Aaranya Kaandam,' it's like a mystical Yeti.
- We seek festivals for two reasons - either to create buzz because it is a small film or to find unexplored markets outside India.
