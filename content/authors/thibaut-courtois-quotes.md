- Rumours affect any club where things are going badly.
- You want to win everything that's possible, starting with the League Cup.
- I love playing there... I like Atletico.
- It is very tough in England. Every away game is hard, of course. And normally, if you're a big club like Chelsea, you're supposed to win games at home against smaller clubs. But in England, that's not the case. We must play well every game.
- The Premier League is very difficult.
- When I saw Iker play at the beginning, what most caught my attention is that a goalkeeper of 18 could stand the pressure of the Bernabeu. He had to be very strong.
- I feel very good at Atletico, and being here allows me to play in the Champions League.
- Madrid and London are great.
- It's one of my stronger points claiming high balls. I'm tall, so that helps me. If you're a smaller goalkeeper, crosses in England are even harder.
- I will try to show in every game that I am one of the best keepers in the world.
- When I joined Chelsea, I had to replace Petr Cech. I still talk to him today; he's a friend.
- My first days in London were not easy.
- I want to win. I think everyone feels that way.
- I want to win the title with Chelsea.
- There is no reason not to be happy at Chelsea.
- If you play a final and win it, you get that feeling to win trophies, and you want to win more and more and more.

- As a player, you always want to win prizes.
- Since the first minute, I fell in love with Spain - the people, the way of life, the food. I have kept up the late dinners, the siesta, and most of the television I watch is Spanish.
- Winning a trophy would be a good way to finish a bad season in a positive way. But I'm not obsessed by the fact I have to win a trophy every year - it's a nice thing, but I know it's sometimes impossible.
- Everybody wants to play in Europe, and if you're in the rhythm of playing a game every three or four days, sometimes you can play better, even though it's harder at the end of the season.
- When I came to England, everyone told me that I'd get the hits, so I was prepared for that.
- I have the biggest respect for Petr Cech. He is one of the best goalkeepers in the world, so I think putting him and me in the same team is not the healthiest thing in the world.
- When I arrived at Atletico, at that point they were not so strong.
- For goalkeepers, the better years, they say, come from the age of 27 or 28.
- My personal situation is related to the city of Madrid. My two children live there with their mum.
- Of course you don't want to concede a goal in any game.
- It was strange joining Chelsea, but when I signed, I knew I would be loaned out to a team. They had, like, a five-year plan for me.
- When you get injured for a long time, it's not nice because you are out of the team and not involved anymore.
- At first sight, Shane Long is just a short striker, but he's good in the air; he's quick, very dangerous, has good feet, and scores goals.

- Since I left Atleti, I have improved my game with my feet considerably, and I have matured a lot as a person.
- It was so nice to see that the Chelsea supporters appreciated my talent and my work at Atletico.

- It is a childhood dream to be in the World Cup.
- I've played against Messi a lot of times, and I've already conceded goals through my legs with him.
- I consider myself half Spanish.
- If the coach on the sidelines is not that strong, transmitting the kind of spirit he has, players won't always handle it well. Life becomes difficult. But, with Mourinho, everything is good. He knows when to be among his players, as 'one of us' making jokes as a friend, and when to be strong and distant, even severe.
- I remember people saying that Atletico wanted me, that they are a big team, and that it will be a big challenge for me. I don't know why, but I just felt really prepared for it, really confident. I went there and tried to do my best in training as well as learn the language really quickly. That was important, I think.
- If you excel, there will always be teams interested in signing the biggest players.

- To be on the bench is not the nicest thing.
- It's a great feeling to be champion of Spain.
- It's nice to win a trophy every season and say every year, 'OK, I won something.'
- In the media, they're always talking about money. I'm not denying that it plays a role, but everything has to be in its right place.
- I have made a lot of progress, above all in speed, reflexes, and experience.
- It is difficult to begin with Atletico, because there is pressure from the fans, because they are accustomed to a very good goalkeeper, but I have no fear of that. I play my game.
- The Premier League is different to Spain.
- If you play for a team like Chelsea, Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, or PSG, the aim is always to win the Champions League.
- I think a goalkeeper has to participate at the back of the defence and come off the line to play.
- Some players are more concentrated on what they will do after their football career and want to make sure their lives are financially settled. I prefer to play in big teams earn a little less money and win trophies.
- As a player, you want to win everything.
- When I was younger, I bought 'FIFA' every year, and I still play now, so to be on the cover would be amazing.

- I wish Atleti the best.
- Atletico was a real group of friends. We went out together, and my teammates taught me a language I did not know at all when I arrived. When I left, I cried.

- As soon as you make a mistake, you're killed by the press.
- When I left Spain, I had it very clear in my mind that I would return one day.
