- While classrooms will be in use for many years to come, their value will diminish quickly as the online options become more pervasive. Many of the physical classrooms will be converted to eLearning laboratories, some to research centers. The real classroom of the future will take place inside the mind of the student, wherever they happen to be.
- Overhead costs are far too high, state support is dropping, and college tuition is far too expensive. Colleges are pricing themselves out of existence.
- The future is our greatest adversary. We are a very backward-looking society, and as such, we are continually blindsided by the future.
- My contention is that most students get distracted by music and social media because our current state of education is not sufficiently engaging to command their full attention.
- People are at their best when they are challenged. If we don't challenge ourselves, nature has a way of giving us challenges anyway. There is great value in our struggles, and human nature has shown us that we only value the things we struggle to achieve.
- Every avalanche begins with the movement of a single snowflake, and my hope is to move a snowflake.
- As we continue down the path of automation, virtually every city will have 24-hour convenience stores, 24-hour libraries, 24-hour banks, 24-hour churches, 24-hour schools, 24-hour movie theaters, 24-hour bars and restaurants, and even 24-hour shopping centers.
- I would welcome processes that eliminate the need for doctors. We bottle-neck things around doctors, and it's not a good way of doing things.
- Learning isn't meant to be confined to a box, and students virtually never 'master' a topic simply by taking a class.
- We will never get to the flying car era. We will get to the era where we get flying drones that haul people, though.
- Solving problems is fine, but it has gotten to the point of being a global obsession. We somehow have it in our heads that if we solve all of the problems, we can sit back and enjoy the easy life. But in reality, we become lazy and complacent. And that's when we get flooded with even bigger problems.
- I will venture to say that sending a probe to the center of the earth will be more difficult than putting a man on the moon or sending a spaceship to Mars.
- Since young people would much rather play fast-action, rapidly advancing video games, and gambling laws for slot machines and roulette tables haven't changed much since the 1950s, look for casinos to build large video game tournament centers and allow people to bet on the action, similar to betting on college basketball.
- Thinking about the future will cause it to change.
- Our greatest motivation in life comes from not knowing the future.
