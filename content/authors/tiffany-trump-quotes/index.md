- I'm blessed to have a dad who's always there for me and a mom who's always there for me, and they're on good terms.
- My father is good with advice, as you might guess. But he keeps it short, and the takeaway is usually the same: to help us find our own way and our own gifts.
- I'm really interested in fashion and technology and kind of just want to be at a place that's innovative and new, where I can actually implement change and have a voice.
- I think every day you wake up, and you do the best you can do that day.
- My mom and I have always been very close since she did raise me as, like, a single mom. My friends and everyone I know are like, 'Wow, you guys really have a really good relationship.' She's with me a lot of the time, so people find that kind of shocking.
- My brothers and sisters have achieved so much in their lives and have had so much success, but I'm just 17, so I'm still growing and learning. Since I have grown up on the West Coast, it definitely is different than all of them growing up on the East Coast. It's a different lifestyle, obviously, California vs. New York.
- I'm so happy to be Tiffany Trump, happy to be in the family I'm in.
- I have a strong head on my shoulders... I've always been grounded. People would think not because of who I am, but I've always been raised with that sense of morals from my dad and my mother.
- In person, my father is so friendly, so considerate, so funny, and so real. I have admired my father all of my life, and I love him with all my heart.
- I don't know what it's like to have a typical father figure. He's not the dad who's going to take me to the beach and go swimming, but he's such a motivational person.
- I love music. It's always been very dear to me. It's a big passion.
