- Hrithik Roshan is my idol both onscreen as well as off screen. I wish that I could become just 50 percent like him.
- My becoming an actor wasn't planned. My interest always lied in sports such as football, martial arts, gymnastics and dance.
- I really respect actors much more now that I am one because I realise what hard work goes into being part of the industry.
- I am a day dreamer. I visualise a lot of things at the same time.
- Since childhood, I wanted to become a superhero. When I do anything in real life, I believe that I am a superhero, like in the way I fight, dance, or jump.
- I am like my mom: early to bed and early to rise.
- It's a very competitive world out there. The competitive spirit is fine within limits. But it shouldn't drown the sheer joy of the game being played. It's natural to want to win. But to me, it's not natural to want others to fail.
- The best feeling in the world for me is when my parents say they are proud of me; I just want to give them all the happiness that they deserve.
- I think stardom means a big responsibility that one has to shoulder.
- I am not an outgoing person. I am a very aloof person who gives a lot to his work. It's very difficult to have a personal life with this kind of mindset.
- After marriage, my love won't be divided between my mom and my wife. It will be doubled. My mom has always been as much my hero as my father.
- I am an over-thinker and tend to stress a lot.
- It is easier for a star kid to get noticed than for a person coming from a non-film background. That being said, I didn't get my first movie because I was Jackie Shroff's son.
- We are entertainers. We have to give our audience a good time. If my name serves that purpose, if that brings a smile on your face, then I think it is good and my job has been done.
- I want to better myself with every film. My goal is to be at the highest level someday, and I know I will get there, too. I have strong work ethics.
- Growing up, my inspirations were Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, all these martial arts legends. I wanted to express my talent on screen in a certain way. I felt that it made me a little different.
- Since childhood, I have been a fan of Spider Man because, according to me, he has the maximum humanity; he is very human, very mortal. So he even gets hurt. He has a poor background, but when he wears the costume, he forgets all of that, all the pressures of the society on him.
- When I had decided to become an actor, I did a lot of soul-searching to figure out how I could be different. What could I bring to the table that others or my father couldn't have? That's when I worked on my strong points, namely action and dancing.
- Every son's first superhero is his father, and it was the same for me. For me, he was Superman and Batman combined.
- I don't eat out much. I eat mostly home food and no carbs after 5 P.M. You are what you eat, and Sunday used to be my cheat day, when I could eat chocolate; but there are no cheats to a good body. Now, I don't give in.
- As for Aamir Khan, he keeps raising the standard with every film. For an artist like me or a newcomer like me, we can only look up to that and dream, 'When will that be us someday?' There's so much to learn from him. He is the encyclopedia of acting.
- I look for roles where I can do justice, show people a side of Bollywood they haven't seen before.
- In my house, my mother is my superhero.
- I am comfortable in my character's skin. I am uncomfortable being in my own skin.
- Apparently, I used to bite, scratch and growl at people when I was young, so my parents named me 'Tiger.'
- Rather than running on the treadmill, which can become quite boring, I prefer to work on my dance routine. Besides being a good form of cardiovascular exercise, it is also a form of escape for me, as I never realise how much time has flown by when I am dancing.
- Whenever I meet children's parents, they complain that the kids don't sleep until they listen to my whistle baja song! My songs have captivated the kids.
- Martial arts is what pulled me through tough times, and it is one of the reasons for my happiness.
- I'm anti-social, and I don't have too many friends. I'm in my own world doing my own things - training in martial arts, dancing, or watching a Michael Jackson video.
- Michael Jackson is so unique, and I look up to him and try to imbibe as much from him and marry it to my own style.
- Being star kids, there are certain expectations to live up to. There's a certain pressure from the public. And, if your film doesn't work, it's even worse.
- If I have to use a body double, it means I'm not well prepared to do what I have to do.
- Spiderman is the underdog, and I love underdogs.
- My mom is my biggest support and critic. I've tried to be a good son, and I don't think I've given her a single day of grief. I want her to know she has my unconditional love.
- As I grew older, I realised that Bruce Lee was an actor first and a martial artist second. If he wasn't a convincing actor and didn't have the emotion in his eyes before delivering a kick or a punch, it wouldn't have made that much of an impact.
- I can stand up for what I believe in. I don't take the word 'rebel' in a negative connotation.
- I will benefit from being a part of this industry, but I also want the industry to benefit from me.
- The day I think I've achieved everything will be the day I fail. There is no end to learning, and I want to continue being a student.
- I am happy with my name. It is such an attraction, and it makes people laugh.
- A lot of people think I'm gay. I have really red lips, so they say I wear lipstick; they say my dance is very feminine, and a lot of people think I look like a girl. But that's fine. I take the criticism positively.
- I definitely think there is a lot of expectation and pressure being a star's son.
- I admire Hrithik Roshan for his work a lot. He has an edge over others because he is very hard on himself, he's never complacent, and he's still not happy with that. How much more perfect can you get than that?
- I couldn't ask for better parents. I keep that at the forefront of whatever I do, and every time I feel like I can't take another step, I see their faces, and that drives me.
- After my 12th standard, I started preparing for the film industry. I've had no formal acting training.
- I am not at all stylish. For me, style is a state of mind and individuality.
- I am trying to give whatever little fans I have as much information as they want from me. I don't want to come across as arrogant or mean by not telling or giving them what them I want. These are the people who make you a star.
- There are so many talented actors in my contemporaries and my seniors... I seek inspiration from each one of them.
- I wish I could say I am a rebel for love in real life. I don't think I am so cool.
- Stuntmen don't have a lavish life. They are such hard working people, but not respected enough. And I don't like that. If I become something in my life, I want to give them a better life, take them to a higher level.
- Even as a child, I would get film offers, and all my friends would tease me saying, 'You will also be an actor like your father,' or 'Don't forget us.' I always took it as a joke, but subconsciously, I felt maybe this was my true calling.
- I deliberately try to carry a different perception of myself as opposed to my father's. I respect my dad and his body of work, but I can't give him credit for what I am today. As a person, I give my parents full credit; career-wise, no.
- I have had a lot of crushes but have never had the courage to go up to a girl and say what I feel. I am scared of rejection.
- Doors opened for me because of who I am. But the downside is, there is way way too much expectation from me, much more than there would have been if I were from outside the film industry.
- Action is a universal language, so everyone understands a punch and a kick.
- I like girls who are the housewife-type.
- I would just urge the youth today to indulge in some sort of physical activity on a regular basis. A holistic approach is essential, and that also means you need to stay happy and positive.
- Every child in every country in every small town should know who I am. There are a handful of people who have achieved that, and two of them are my idols Michael Jackson and Bruce Lee. I'd like to get to that level someday and touch as many lives as I can.
- I like superheroes who are very human and underdog. That's why I relate to my character in 'A Flying Jatt': because he is a very normal person and very human. He was very unsure about his super powers; he didn't know how to use them. He is scared of heights, speed. Especially he is scared of his mom, but he has to listen to her.
- I don't have that X factor; I have to bank on my skills, be true to my character, and hope to be accepted.
- I think cinema is so visually driven now, and people are so taken in by the glamour, gloss and all things good looking that we don't appreciate the craft as much as we used to in the bygone era.
- I am who I am. I am not very complicated. I am simple and an introvert.
- After working for a couple of years, I have realised how much hard work it takes to become an actor, and my father has gone through it all these years. It's draining, both physically and mentally, but he makes it look so effortless.
- I never liked going to school and would sham and play football. I played in the centre forward position. If ever given a choice, I would love to represent Barcelona.
- In school, I would run away whenever there was trouble, as I would get bullied a lot.
