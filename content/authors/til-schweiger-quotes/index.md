- A lot of directors, they don't go into the editing room during the shoot. When they come back, they've forgotten what they've shot. That's why their films come out a year after they shoot them.
- I don't understand why Germans are openly demonstrating against Islamization and radicalization but don't help the people who flee from such horrors.
- I lived in L.A. for seven years, and if you're a German actor, they always throw the Nazi parts at you.
- I knew some people at my school who were squatters, and my younger brother was a squatter. I knew those guys: those were the people who said the Russians were the good guys and the Americans were bad. But I was the guy who went to the disco.
- I'm going to build a refugee home together with friends.
- Germany is the country where action films perform the worst. It's the worst market in the world for these kind of movies.
- We haven't done action movies in Germany. We had some attempts in the '90s, but they failed.
- I hate sitting around and waiting; that's why I always have an editing suite on set.
- Maybe the first secret is, 'Don't bore people.'
- I just fooled around in front of the camera and earned money for it. Every policeman, every soldier, every nurse - they all do more for society. I just rent my face.
- I'm happy when my name's not in the paper.
- Action alone doesn't work in Germany - you need an emotional element to the story.
- Germans aren't action fans. The only kind of action that really works is 'Bond.'
- I love action films. It's my favorite genre.
- I don't think German films have to be heavy or intellectual the way they sometimes used to be.
- The Russian male audience, they loved 'Knockin' on Heaven's Door,' and they like my comedies, but the Russian male audience is action, action, action.
- A lot of people are thanking me for standing up, but I don't want to be the only one standing up. Our political leaders are important. But I don't see anyone hunting down these guys setting refugee camps on fire or sending them to jail.
- There should be consequences for those who openly voice racist and fascist opinions. Our politicians should stand up way more; our justice system should stand up way more and punish these people harder than they ever did before.
- I don't want to be the only one speaking up for the refugees. I get all these comments from people saying, 'Thanks so much for your courage,' and, 'You're the only one who's spoken out.' But I don't want to be the only one speaking up.
- They've been bashing me since I started making films.
- I'm the most successful filmmaker in the country; what do I need PR for?
- We want to build a flagship refugee home. And I'm going to establish a charity for traumatized children.
- It was a shock for me to see that there are obviously more people in Germany with fascist opinions than I thought there would be.
