- I hope we will use the Net to cross barriers and connect cultures.
- The Semantic Web isn't inherently complex. The Semantic Web language, at its heart, is very, very simple. It's just about the relationships between things.
- One of the things I like about the computer that I use is that I can write a program on it or I can download a program on to it and run it. That's kind of important to me, and that's also kind of important to the whole future of the internet... obviously a closed platform is a serious brake on innovation.
- The Domain Name Server (DNS) is the Achilles heel of the Web. The important thing is that it's managed responsibly.

- It's interesting that people throughout the existence of the web have been concerned about monopolies.
- I think IT projects are about supporting social systems - about communications between people and machines. They tend to fail due to cultural issues.
- I'm not a fan of giving a website a simple number like an IQ rating because like people they can vary in all kinds of different ways. So I'd be interested in different organisations labelling websites in different ways.
- I have built a moat around myself, along with ways over that moat so that people can ask questions.
- We need diversity of thought in the world to face the new challenges.
- On the web the thinking of cults can spread very rapidly and suddenly a cult which was 12 people who had some deep personal issues suddenly find a formula which is very believable.
- When you go onto the internet, if you really rummage around randomly then how do you hope to find something of any of value?
- Any enterprise CEO really ought to be able to ask a question that involves connecting data across the organization, be able to run a company effectively, and especially to be able to respond to unexpected events. Most organizations are missing this ability to connect all the data together.
- The most important thing that was new was the idea of URI-or URL, that any piece of information anywhere should have an identifier, which will allow you to get hold of it.
- When it comes to professionalism, it makes sense to talk about being professional in IT. Standards are vital so that IT professionals can provide systems that last.
- Everybody who runs a Web site knows we're not assured of compatibility, and we could end up with a split.
- The Web is now philosophical engineering. Physics and the Web are both about the relationship between the small and the large.
- Most larger companies now see that for the market to grow, Web infrastructure must be royalty-free.
- Physicists analyze systems. Web scientists, however, can create the systems.
- It was really hard explaining the Web before people just got used to it because they didn't even have words like click and jump and page.
- Web users ultimately want to get at data quickly and easily. They don't care as much about attractive sites and pretty design.

- Innovation is serendipity, so you don't know what people will make.
- Celebrity damages private life.
- I should be able to pick which applications I use for managing my life, I should be able to pick which content I look at, and I should be able to pick which device I use, which company I use for supplying my internet, and I'd like those to be independent choices.
- The original idea of the web was that it should be a collaborative space where you can communicate through sharing information.
- Customers need to be given control of their own data-not being tied into a certain manufacturer so that when there are problems they are always obliged to go back to them.
- In many ways, people growing up with the Web and now the Semantic Web take the power at their fingertips for granted.
- Sites need to be able to interact in one single, universal space.
- In '93 to '94, every browser had its own flavor of HTML. So it was very difficult to know what you could put in a Web page and reliably have most of your readership see it.
- We could say we want the Web to reflect a vision of the world where everything is done democratically. To do that, we get computers to talk with each other in such a way as to promote that ideal.
- I suppose it's amazing when you think how many things people get involved in that don't work.

- The Semantic Web is not a separate Web but an extension of the current one, in which information is given well-defined meaning, better enabling computers and people to work in cooperation.

You probably wouldn't have imagined that a world of answers would be available to you in under a second. The next set of advances will have an different effect, but similar in magnitude.

- The important thing is the diversity available on the Web.
- The amount of control you have over somebody if you can monitor internet activity is amazing.

- Data is a precious thing and will last longer than the systems themselves.
