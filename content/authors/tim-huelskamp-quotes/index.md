- I've learned a long time ago if you don't have anything to hide, you shouldn't be pleading the Fifth, and most Americans get it.
- Kids need a mom and a dad, and people understand that. Marriage between a mom and a dad is most important for kids.
- Like the pro-slavery forces who invaded Kansas, the pro-abortion forces in Washington and elsewhere want us to believe that abortion is not murder; that being born is worse than death; that the unborn baby is property, not a person.
- When under siege, if we do not stand for our liberties and for the liberties of those who are unable to stand for themselves, then the great American experience will come to an end.
- The institution of marriage holds society together. We can't replace the family.
- At the end of the day, Obamacare is bad for America. Washington, D.C., exempted themselves. U.S. senators still do not have to be on Obamacare.
- Some men don't want to be responsible fathers. It's easier to say 'Let's just turn the kids over to the state.' Women end up bearing the entire load, raising kids alone without a husband to share the parenting.
- Fairness is not the end result, it's the opportunity. And everybody in America today has the opportunity to get ahead.
- It's not about what the speaker wants. It's not about necessarily what I want. There's two other principles involved here. It's what the constituents in my district want, and they didn't want to raise the debt ceiling unless there were significant structural reforms and spending cuts to help us balance our budget.
- In many ways, the crumbling of the institution of marriage is the real 'war on women.' Marriage is the civilizing influence for men and for families.
- Marriage can be tough. It really is. But God is calling you to do everything you can. It's just not you and your spouse. There's a third person in your marriage. And God would like to bless and protect that marriage, and give you many fruitful days ahead.
