- My James Taylor albums sat quite comfortably next to my Rush and Aerosmith collections.
- What works for me in 'Indiana Jones' is the fact that I can project myself onto the character. Maybe if I was cool enough, I could do what he does. But I can't do that if the story breaks the rules of reality in too large of a degree.
- In the past, there's reasons why 'The Goon' wasn't made; it's because people were afraid of edgy animation. Now, I think that 'Deadpool' has proved that that audience is out there in a bigger way than some people thought.
- I don't look at 'Deadpool' and think, 'Oh, that's a perfect movie.' I look at it and go, 'Oh, God, there's so much stuff I could do better.'
- If you look at Keith Richards' hands, from the Rolling Stones, they're these gnarled, arthritic - it looks like people beat his hands with clubs. It's amazing there's so much character in his hands.
- If we do another 'Deadpool,' we'd love to have more money for visual effects. But I don't think anybody does good with an excess of time or money.
- I think 'Deadpool' worked because of what it was. I think 'Deadpool' worked because it was funny. I think 'Deadpool' worked because it didn't take itself seriously. That's why it worked as an R-rated film.
- The reason I love comics and have collected them for 37 years is because I always wanted to be an illustrator and a writer - and comics are really the perfect blend of those two mediums.
- In 'Deadpool,' we stayed far away from the shiny, clean X-Men world. It's really the seedy underbelly of what's been shown in other superhero films.
- 'Goon' is very much an action - it's got a lot of heart, it's got a lot of comedy, it's got a lot of similarities to what I think was successful in 'Deadpool,' and so I think it's not a stretch to compare those two things and say the world is a little more ready than they used to be for this kind of material.
