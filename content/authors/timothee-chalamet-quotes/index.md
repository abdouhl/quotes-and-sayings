- I've seen Hugh Jackman in a thousand Broadway shows.
- I've always felt like there was less creative space on sets with guardians. I just felt independent at a young age.
- Somebody said to me, 'You should keep a journal of this period in your life and really write down this stuff.' But that makes me a little uneasy.
- I wouldn't be the actor I am without New York.
- I went to LaGuardia, so I'm very close to the reality that lot of actors work rarely.
- My dad's French, and I spent my summers in France growing up. So I speak French fluently, and obviously, I speak English because I was raised in New York, and I grew up here.
- My favorite kind of acting scenes, or at least where I think people shine the brightest, are odes to Meisner technique scenes where people are face-to-face, and it's almost like a repetition exercise.
- I have experienced heartbreak but not in a classical sense.
- We're only here for so long. Be happy, man. You could get hit by a truck tomorrow.
- I did 'Prodigal Son' at Manhattan Theatre Club.
- Ninety-eight per cent of all human communication is non-verbal.
- I love the East Village.
- I did a year at Columbia, and I just kind of floundered. Maybe it wasn't the right place for me.
- When I try to appreciate something, it feels like my hands are around the moment, trying to squeeze it. It's when you really release yourself of the responsibility to be enjoying things that you actually do.
- I spent a lot of time in a small town in France, growing up.
- I've been very encouraged by the nature of the conversations that I've had and by the lack of questions that are tunnel-visioned in their understanding of sexuality and life and love.
- I feel like I've been around performance my whole life. My mom and uncle had done plays.
- Sometimes, when you act with someone in an intimate capacity, you have to ask vulnerable questions to speed up intimacy - but that's artificial.
- I should become a peach brand ambassador.
- I played the piano growing up and then stopped for 10 or 12 years.
- The villain in 'Call Me by Your Name' is the tragedy of love - what seems to be part of the deal you sign with someone when you experience an amazing time with them.
- I don't like to know exactly what I'm going to do in a scene, because the most interesting moments as an audience member are moments of truthful spontaneity.
- Sometimes if I'm in my head before a take, I'll just like to reach out to the closest thing to me - the wall or a sharp edge - and just push into it. That way, my physical experience is totally contemporaneous and not in the clouds.
- I'm not someone who frequents the gym, pretty much ever.
- These are such First World problems, but there's a certain claustrophobia to New York. You don't escape in the East Village, but it at least feels full of camaraderie and youth - or full of camaraderie and youth in an East Village that is as full of Chase banks and Starbucks as the Upper West Side, or anywhere else in Manhattan.
- There's the truth to every moment that you have to bring to every scene, but you have to understand the tonality of the film before you begin, which isn't something that's instinctual to me.

- I want to attack and to lead my life with vigor, but I'm in the watching stage at the moment. Younger actors feel pressure to bring a pop to every scene; as the roles get bigger, I'm finding you can add layers and do less scene-to-scene.
- Learning the Italian was tough. I tried to really come at from a purist perspective, really learn the grammar, syntax and conjugations.
- I'm sure no one really wants to think of themselves as a child actor.
- I have this sense of independent heartbreak, of annulling romances before they get their feet off the ground.
- I do find that there's a fine balance between preparation and seeing what happens naturally.
- On American sets, you work 12-, 14-, 16-hour days sometimes. All that volume over a short course of time can actually be less conducive to telling a story accurately.
- There is an audition floating around somewhere that I did for 'Bates Motel.'
- First and foremost, 'Call Me by Your Name' is a story about love, and first loves, and unrequited, and then, later, requited love.
- I miss the sense of belonging on a film as much as I did on 'Call Me By Your Name.'
