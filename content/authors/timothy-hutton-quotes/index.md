- I remember, when we started 'Leverage,' we were all in Chicago, and I read the script for the pilot and thought, 'Boy, this is just a real interesting place to begin a character.' I had to figure out how to go about playing someone who had hit rock bottom.
- When I was doing 'Ordinary People' and 'Taps,' I never wondered if it would have a lasting impression. I was just wanting to make the best film we could and do my part in that and be true to what my responsibilities were.
- I was 19 when I got my first passport as an adult. I had moved from California to New York City and was living out of a suitcase, staying with friends. I'd just finished filming my first movie, 'Ordinary People,' but I didn't know whether acting was what I wanted to do with my life.
- What I learned at that moment on the subway 30 years ago, staring at my blank passport, was this: If you have an impulse to do something, and it's not totally irresponsible, why not do it? It might just be the journey you've always needed.
- Any time that we read a script and the 'Leverage' team has to infiltrate a place, assume identities, or become con artists ourselves to take down the really bad con artists, it's always fun to do that.
- With 'Kidnapped,' there didn't seem to be a sure hand guiding it: everything had to be run-up-the-pole, so to speak, and there seemed to be a large committee, every day fighting about what the show was about.
- I grew up as normally as any other kid. Between that small TV part I did at five and when I turned professional actor at 18, I stayed away from the limelight, so I was just like any typical kid who went to school.
- In 'Leverage,' I don't really play an insurance investigator but a man who used to be an insurance investigator.
- There are plenty of examples of really well-executed shows you could look at and say, 'Well, clearly this show will have an audience; why wouldn't it?' And for whatever reason, it just doesn't catch on. So you never know going in.
- Here's one thing I can't understand: people who are friends with their exes.
- In acting, you are fulfilled if you give justice to your role... if you are able to do a credible performance and touch the audience. Same with directing. If you are able to draw out the best from your actors, then you fulfill your job as a director.
- There's probably a little more creative freedom in cable versus network, a little less of a committee looking over everyone's shoulder, but it depends on the network; it depends on the show; it depends on who the head writer or show runner is and what track record they have.
- A film has a sort of life over time, whereas a TV show comes up in your living room, and it's immediate, and people write about it.
- I've enjoyed watching 'Lost.' I'm a big fan of 'Mad Men.'
- I've worked with Filipino technicians, and they are, I think, among the best. I'm looking forward to visiting the Philippines, maybe for a vacation or to shoot a movie.
- TNT is a really great company to do a show for. They really believe in their shows and give shows a lot of support. They have it all worked out before you start shooting. Everybody's on the same page.
- Treat Williams and I have been friends for years. To finally get to work together was great.
- I saw a guy being really abusive to his girlfriend. She was asking people to help, but no one would. When he grabbed her, I tried to separate them, but he turned on me. I punched him and knocked him down. It wasn't a scandal; I was just doing what anybody should.
- Even in the off season, people are streaming the show or buying the DVD sets, and new audience comes to 'Leverage' every year we've been doing it.
