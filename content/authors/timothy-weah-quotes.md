- Being an 18 year-old football player, there are temptations. There are girls. There's going out to parties. There's doing this; there's doing that. There is drinking and blah, blah, blah. But at the end of the day it all comes down to maturity and what you have to do as a man to reach that next level. You have to be disciplined and make sacrifices.
- Obviously, at PSG, they have the best players in the world. Being with that group has really made me strong. I have watched the ins and outs of everyone, Neymar and Mbappe and all those guys in training, and I really feel that it has moulded me into a stronger person and a fighter, and it made me a lot hungrier than before.
- My dream is eventually becoming the greatest talent to come out of the United States and New York, being a starter, and playing for my country.
