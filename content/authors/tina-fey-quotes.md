You've got to experience failure to understand that you can survive it.
- I really admire stand-up, and I think I would have loved to learn how to do it. I think it's terrifying and thrilling. A really cool thing to do. It's a dying art, in a way.

- I work, and then whenever I have any other time, I'm with my daughter, and then I go to sleep. I think you basically have to abandon the dreams of having any other adult activities in your life. You have to go to sleep whenever your child goes to sleep. That's basically how we're doing it.

But he would let us stay up really late in the summer and watch old 'Honeymooners'.

- Someone once said that to make a regular person laugh, you need to dress a guy up like an old lady and push him down the stairs.
