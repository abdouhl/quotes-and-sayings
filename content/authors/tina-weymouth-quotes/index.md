- If you have this passion for music, you don't stop doing it - it chooses you and doesn't release you.
- Make it, not make it? What's the difference? Music is a language, it's a dance of life, and it can be a part of your life without being something that earns.
- It's just such a pleasure to bring a talent you respect to the world.
- I don't want to wreck my voice. I love to concentrate on playing the bass and keeping it very rock-solid. If I were singing, I would have blown out my voice.
- Sometimes you don't want to be a slapstick clown in order to convey a funny perception of the world.
- We're not getting paid. We have these great musicians with us and it gives us a real charge. And the audience gives us a charge, because they keep it interesting all the time.
- We groove off of everything, any sort of live show. The inner dialogue you're having with yourself, between you and the music, is for me the search for God.
- When we were making Speaking in Tongues and Remain in Light, we were jamming. From that we were taking the best bits and then recording and improvising on top of those.
- Talking Heads, for me and Chris, was a very personal thing that we shared with a lot of people. In a way, I'm glad it's over, because it allows us to move beyond the restrictions that followed.
- Richard Lloyd of Television is one of my favorite guitarists. His mentor was Jimi Hendrix when he was just 14. Jimi was always pounding everything he knew into that kid.
- I would really love to work with Paul McCartney. Isn't that arrogant?

- Stick to your instincts.
- I like the idea of Wild Infancy, of people who have a deprived background, of starting out wild.
- We don't always know what we're doing. We often just get excited, put something down, and say, 'Oh, neat'.
- I have respect for those who make money at art and do it well and smartly, because that commercial aspect keeps the world going and running, in a sense.
- When Talking Heads started, we called ourselves Thinking Man's Dance Music.
- Even the Beatles found it hard to escape their image; they were trapped by it.
- Art is not predictable. Art is not golf, as great as that may be. There are 360 degrees of choice to make.
- It's hard to be perfect, It really is. I keep learning things after I've already bungled it.
- I think the idea of having the show divided into two parts was that Tom Tom Club opened for Talking Heads in Europe, and it was the best we'd ever had as an opening act.
- I play bass. I don't have to go out there and screech.
- We always thought the Tom Tom Club could change to anything, but it acquired this image, which was cartoon animation and this real light-hearted dance music.
- I wasn't originally a bass player. I just found out I was needed, because everyone wants to play guitar.
- It's a cruel, heartless world out there in commercial rock 'n' roll, and when you take as much time off as we did, eight years, booking agents don't know if you'll draw.
- We had our unhappy moments but they got channelled into the kind of sadness that was necessary for singing a song about going nowhere. So it worked out very well I think.
- We don't really have more than acouple of solos. It's just the way our music is put together.
- You learn just as much from your failures. Sometimes you love your failures even more.
- Many Japanese painters and calligraphers would change their names intentionally to keep their relationship to the art always fresh. This way, others' expectations can be avoided.
- David is purely a conceptual artist. He didn't play any instruments or paint or anything. We were painters.
