- I started my first film, 'Duniya Meri Jeb Main,' with my childhood friends, Shashi and Rishi Kapoor. My brother became the producer. It was nice of Rishi to support my brother by not charging us a single penny.
- Why should I make films for some intelligent people?
- My father, Inder Raj Anand - a famous writer in his own right - was a great friend of Satyajit Ray.
- The good thing about being a foodie is that not only are you eating well yourself, you always want to share your recipes, your experiences, your best restaurants with the world.

- I have directed Amitabh in four films - 'Kaalia,' 'Shahenshah,' 'Main Azad Hoon' and 'Major Saab' - and we have always been hand-in-glove.
- I don't think anyone can really claim to be a really close friend of Amitabh Bachchan. There are so many things people don't know, even I don't know. He has a few people who are close and he likes it that way.
- I worked with him on 'Agneepath,' where we acted together. I played his uncle. Everyone, including Amitabh himself, wondered how I would play his uncle since I was younger than him.

- Amitabh Bachchan played the role I was supposed to play in 'Saat Hindustani' but I cannot say he got his first film because of me. He had already been cast in the film, but was playing a different role.
- 'Jalsaghar' brings back memories of some great music.
- The kind of films I make cost a lot of money.
- Had I been to Uttarakhand in the '80s and '90s, surely I would have filmed many scenes of my films here.
- Ultimately, entertainment and all the tangents related to it, will come down to one little gadget in our pockets, which is our mobile phones. And such will be the impact of this that they will not just influence but even dictate the content of all the other mediums of entertainment.
- Many years ago, my neighbor told me that his daughter is very brave and she never cries. I was surprised. So, I took it up as a challenge. I met her and sat next to her, staring at her straight in the eye for a few minutes.
- Tell me about one son of a famous director who makes films like his father? Why do you expect a student to become a teacher?

- I knew I could never become a good actor.
- From day one I knew Farooque Sahab was a great guy.
- I started with the fantasy film, 'Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne.' It was a film to be seen to be believed. It was made in 1968. It was partly colored and was made with huge sets, created in a Kolkata studio.
