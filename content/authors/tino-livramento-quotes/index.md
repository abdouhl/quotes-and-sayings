- Me and my dad sat down in May and we spoke and thought the next step would be for me to push into a Premier League team and we felt the better route for me was to leave Chelsea.
- I was at Chelsea for so long and grew up a fan and never played at Stamford Bridge in a competitive game.
- Going into Chelsea when I was around seven for the trial, there were loads of boys there.
- You've got to enjoy competition and when you get given any opportunity you've got to take it.
- That's kind of always been that thing in the back of mind if I'm good enough to do certain things or take that next step in my career.
- You never know when you're going to get given the opportunity that change many things in your life.
- It is all well and good talking about it, but until you get tested and come out of your comfort zone a bit, you don't see how you really are as a player.
- When Southampton showed interest it was hard for me to turn down a club that has proven to be a great place for young players to grow and get given the opportunity to show a bigger audience that they are ready.
- I've always liked the way Southampton play football, high intensity and really aggressive playing. The way they play with the full-backs I'm not going to be sitting back for the whole game, it is going to give me opportunities to get forward and show what I can give in attack.
- I'll never have a bad word to say about how Chelsea treated me growing up and developing me into the player I am today. It's probably the best academy in the world that anyone would want to go to and develop.
- Being young, I've always wanted to just play first-team football as soon as possible.
- I think it is also good for my development, playing in a team like Southampton at right-back where sometimes you're going to be under pressure and be one-v-one with the best players in the world, let alone the League.
- Every single year, I have a routine of setting goals and there is only so much you can do at youth level.
- The Premier League is the toughest in the world probably, there's not going to be an easy game. It is what I've dreamt of, so when I step onto that pitch I'm just playing how I want to play, playing with freedom and that is what the manager wants.
