- A woman who's light on her feet is always going to make the guy on her arm look better.
- I think most people who were involved with television will tell you, if given a season or given a 13-episode order and getting those episodes on the air, and if viewers don't come, I think most people will tell you they'd walk away. They feel they were given a fair shake, and if viewers didn't come, they didn't come.
- Any movie that gets made and ends up in a position where people are coming to talk about it, it's not a small thing.
- I've known Greg Berlanti from way back. I've done two shows with him, and both times, he was like, 'I've got something good for you,' and they did not disappoint.
- For me, if its television, if it's theater, if it's film, and it's good, I don't make much of distinction between the 3. I think there's only so many great stories out there. If you get the chance to be a part of one, it doesn't matter what it is.
- It's nice to have people interested about a show that you're involved in. It's what actors want.
