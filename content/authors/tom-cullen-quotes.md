- I think the older you get, the more lax you get, and the less romantic you are.
- I'm interested in pursuing roles that allow me to push against my own walls, my own constraints as a human being, and to find out where I'm capable of going. In real life, I'm not very good at feeling emotions, so I like to do it through my work.
- For me, I can't live without acting or drama and writing - I also run a theater company.
- From an egotistical point of view, I'm always interested in roles that push me as a person. I'm interested in humans as animals and as products of society.
- When I was 17, I had my first proper girlfriend, and on Valentine's Day, I painted a canvas of her, bought her a massage, put flowers on the stairs, and ran a bath.
- I look to James Franco with complete admiration. He makes interesting choices. Whether right or wrong, that is up to someone else to decide, but I think what he does is brilliant.
- I think every role that I go up for is daunting.
- I'm very accident-prone. The problem is I sort of just do things. I'm impulsive, and sometimes I don't think.
- To be honest, I'm not even thinking about America. If I was to start thinking about the enormity of 'Downton' and the size of the project, then I wouldn't be able to be very truthful to the work. I would start to watch myself too much. I'm not even thinking about it. Who knows what will happen.
- I came to acting quite late. I tried not to be an actor.
- People in the U.K. absolutely love my character in 'Downton,' and in equal measure, people absolutely hate him, and that's all I wanted.
