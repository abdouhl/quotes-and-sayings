- Be sure to read a recipe all the way through before you cook. The time it saves you in the long run is invaluable.
- Every chef has his treats. By that, I mean bits and pieces from things you're working on - crusty little cake trimmings, ends from a brisket, collars from a salmon, scraps. But they're snacks to me, and I eat them right off the cutting board - maybe too much.

- When you watch 'Shark Tank,' everything is about off-shore this, off-shore that.
- My favorite way to cook trout is whole, bone-in, on the grill. The fish are stuffed with sliced lemons and herb sprigs, brushed with oil, and cooked over fairly hot coals until the skin is crisp and the flesh is moist and flaky. Go ahead and gild the lily by adding a sauce.
- I think you owe it to your kids to teach them how to cook - you know, self-survival.

- How can anyone live off of minimum wage?
- A chunk of seared albacore tuna, salted and peppered, then seared rare in a little oil in a hot skillet for just a minute or so per side, is the perfect addition to a savory plate of fried rice. Just slice the tuna across the grain and fan those mild, meaty slices over the top of the rice.

- I think that people need to stand up with their backbone and not go to places where they feel like the workers aren't taken care of.

- I can't believe how many people don't have time to cook but have time to watch football and 'The Voice.' They're certainly making a choice.

- Most of America doesn't pay dishwashers $10.
- My own favorite way to cook and eat razor clams is to simply dredge them in a mix of seasoned flour and cornmeal, then pan fry them in butter until crisp and golden. Be careful not to overcook them so they stay tender, not tough and chewy.
- It's always a good idea to chill your crab cake mixture for a few hours, or even overnight, before frying because they'll hold together better.
- After being cooked, ling cod tends to bleed out some moisture, so, before serving, let it rest a few moments on a plate. Once the moisture has been released, you can carefully pick up the fillet with a slotted spatula and transfer it to another plate for saucing. This way, you won't sog out your beautiful sauce.
