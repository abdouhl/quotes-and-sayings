- You avoid the hype while you're working, you have to, but the premiere is the one night of the year where you can enjoy it.
- Nothing's really changed since the Harry Potter films came along.
- My mother is looking forward to it even more than me! I'll be showing her the bright lights of New York.
- Everyone plays their own crucial part towards the film.
- I would miss months of school and then return with bright blond hair. Needless to say, there was bullying. I wasn't beaten up daily, but there was name-calling and jealousy. You have to bear in mind that 'Harry Potter' wasn't cool. I wasn't part of the 'Terminator' franchise.
- Whatever life throws at me I'll take it and be grateful for it as well.
- I don't go to the cinema much.
- My favorite holiday spot has to be New York, on the St. Lawrence River. Without a doubt that area there is perfect for me. Very, very spacious. It's nice.
- It's shocking to say, but the cinema is quite a while away from me, and I haven't got a car yet.
- I think I'd take a human butler over a robot one.
- I find it's usually the bullies who are the most insecure.
- I have done a bit of recording and the songs are available on iTunes, and I've got some nice comments. It's something I enjoy doing, but I'm not looking for a singing career any time soon. As long as one person gets enjoyment out of it, I'm happy to make it available.
- I'm generally more and more in my comfort zone in the wild.
- I don't like to label films with a genre.
- Oh God, you know what would be really good for me is a dog locater - it would save me the hours that I have to spend looking for my dog.
- People always tell me I'm nothing like my character. Well, hopefully not! He's a character who's very defined. He was purposefully written by Jo Rowling as very one-dimensional in the first few books, because you're supposed to hate him.
- As soon as you see 'Dame' in front of someone's name, you get nervous, but Dame Maggie Smith is the most wonderfully gentle woman I have ever met. She never had a bad word to say.
- I bought a lot of rubbish things that kids buy: skateboards and clothes and typical teenage stuff.
- And to me, fame is not a positive thing. The idea of being famous is a lot better than the reality. It's fantastic when you go to premieres and people cheer you, but it's not real. And it's totally not my approach to get my name on a club door just because I can.
- I like to fish. Fishing is always a way of relaxing.
- I hope to be scaring children for the rest of my life.
- There was a scary two years where it was madness because I was really in trouble with the taxman.
- It sounds like a media line, but I'm passionate about thanking the fans for their support.
- Draco's not really a bully. He's not exactly the biggest, strongest guy in the world. He's more a rich, snobby person. He thinks of himself as really cool.
- I'd like to own my own garage and my own fishery. I'd also like to be a professional fisherman. But I'll take whatever happens.
- No, I don't suppose I'm so much a collector sort of person.
- I'm a keen musician. Me and my mates have a great times jamming and recording stuff. We have a great band behind us and have turned my nursery-rhyme songs into quite credible pieces of music.
- Yeah, we held a junior carp tournament on the St. Lawrence River in New York last August. I hosted that along with a couple of other people.
- I really tried out for the part of Harry Potter, but they ended up picking me for the part of the enemy of Harry. Actually it is really fun playing the bad kid because it just has so many interesting qualities to it. And Daniel Radcliffe and I get along really well off set so it's really fun filming.
- I'm a little bit of a geek - I have to be the first person to get new things when they come out. I always want to buy and try new gadgets.
- I bought a lot of rubbish things that kids buy: skateboards and clothes and typical teenage stuff. And, as soon as I could, I wasted a lot of money on cars - BMW's mostly - for myself and my family.
- If someone tried to take the hierarchy thing too seriously - for example, being lovely to producers but moaning to runners about the tea - that would not be accepted on 'Harry Potter'; someone would pull you aside and have a word.
- Whether it's acting, directing or writing, I want to be involved in the film industry for the rest of my life.
- As soon as I get my car I think I'll be going to the cinema more. Since I don't go very often, there are no films that are a must see at the moment. I usually wait till they come out on DVD.
- I had been working for eight years and all I had to show for it was this horrible debt. At one point we had the bailiff at the door.
- Well, my closest friends are still the ones that I went to school with, but it's nice to go to work, at the studios, and have people there that you're willing to talk to and have a good conversation with.
- What a house. Turns out they're doing OK, the Malfoy's. However, the interior decorating leaves a lot to be desired. And needless to say, Voldemort isn't the greatest houseguest.
- I like geography. I like to know where places are.
- I really liked the snake that breaks out of the cage in the beginning of the movie. I saw it in real life, and it was really cool. Really big and fat. The owls are cool as well, but you can't really pet them.
- Also, I just think of Draco and he gets me in the right mood. He just keeps getting worse and worse.
- A nice pop star would do you nice on one of those deserted islands.
- It's definitely more fun playing a bad guy. It feels a lot better than playing one of the good guys.
- I'm a real big country boy.
- I'm terrible at texting people back. It takes me, like, three days. I'm not a big phone person.
- I'm such an admirer, I am an admirer of villains, especially working with so many great ones.
- I started my own record label.
- I'd have to just say that working with other people, it's a different world from school.
- I had a great childhood.
- I'll take my clothes off - whatever the job requires.
- Those of you that think filming is all glamour, you're so wrong! Really, only the premieres are the glitzy bits.
- I want to take a few years out, maybe make a couple of more films or whatever.
- I used to have some fish, some nice little carp, but they got too big for the tank. I don't have any pets now.
- I'm not too unintelligent.
- When I was 9 or 10 years old it wasn't the thing to be seen doing - reading a book in your spare time.
- The idea of being famous is a lot better than the reality.
- Working with big actors and realising that they were just normal people who've got an incredible talent was just a great experience.
- I'm obsessed with shopping. I'll get these urges to buy, like to shop for stuff on the Internet. I search for all kinds of weird gizmos I could get.
- Yes I still enjoy playing him. He's the best person to play isn't he?
- I like the dueling club scene, where Daniel and I fight with our wands. I thought it was a brilliant scene to shoot. I think the end product looked really good.
- The Japanese fans always send weird things.
- I used to have all the Goosebumps books as a kid too.
- There are a couple of carp fishing books I've been reading. I'm very interested in that line of books, because I think they write very well, carp anglers, about the general environment.
- I went to see every angler on the bank to see how they were doing, to try to give them a few tips or whatever. But yeah, we had a lot of fun. It was definitely a good time and we're definitely going to do it again next year.
- If young children boo me, that makes my day.
- It took us a lot of man hours to get that bloody white hair out, so it's good to get rid of it.
- I'm going to change my image - backward caps, the lot.
- I'd rather play a character that was really, really different to me as to someone who is quite close to my character.
- I'm not a big splurger of money, but my guilty pleasures do lie within BMWs. I get roped in.
- It's fun to be blond, and it's almost difficult to remember how I used to look with my proper hair color.
- Going online and asking questions is the best way to learn.
- You can finish school as soon as you finish the GCSE's.
- I'm always buying gadgets, especially at airports.
- I don't have an album cover with me on a broomstick.
- What twelve year old wouldn't want to play an evil wizard?
- I remember my first scene with Alan Rickman, and I was anxious because he is a slight 'method' actor; as soon as he is in his cloak, he walks and talks like Snape - it is quite terrifying. But I really wanted to talk to him because 'Robin Hood' was one of my favourite films.
- The actual course is called fishery studies, and you study general aquatics and fishery management.
- I'd love to be in Paul McCartney's shoes for a day. I'd love to pick up a guitar and write songs like he does. Or to experience what it might have been like to be a Beatle for a day.
- I'd like to know about some of the things that they teach down there, like building a lake. If I ever wanted to build a lake, I'd like to know how to do it.
- I plan to go to college in Southampton, a fishery studies college. Again, my brother was down there about two years ago and he said it was great, so I'm looking forward to that.
- I was cursed with age, really. You do that stupid thing at 12 years old when you say something and it kind of sticks with you for the rest of your life. So, I believe I said I wanted to be a fishery manager. In hindsight, I think acting could be a better route.
- I like physics. I think it is the best science out of all three of them, because generally it's more useful. You learn about speed and velocity and time, and that's all clever stuff.
- The only time I can really relax is up a tree or somewhere outside. I love being outside.
- Bad boys do get the girls.
- You see another side of Draco when he's with his dad. When Draco is with his dad, he doesn't say anything. He keeps his mouth shut. He's sort of bullied by his dad, so he acts very different.
- If you're put on a set with a lot of people, it's just nice to see everyone working together.
- My favorite country is America. I love going there! I go in the local lake near where I work on Sundays. It's called Berry Hill.
- I like all films whether it's dark or light, love, hate, whatever it is, I enjoy it.
- I like me Italian girls; half Halle Berry, half Penelope Cruz sort of thing!
- One thing that people keep on saying to me is that the wealth and the fame must have made up for missing out on my childhood. But the idea of money - putting a price on your childhood - is ridiculous. You will never get those years back and you can't put a price on them.
- I live right in the middle of nowhere and I thoroughly enjoy it.
- The music stuff is just a hobby.
- I have met a couple of six-year-olds who were apparently quite excited to meet me - before they actually met me. And when they actually met me they ran behind their parents' legs and cowered for shelter.
- I am looking to get into the grime rap U.K. scene.
- In England we are sort of very awkward.
- I like my ladies lady-ish, feminine so to speak. I love jeans and hoodies, but the idea of being an ultimate tomboy does slightly confuse me.
- I like the laid-back ladies. Looks are stressed so much these days, and a lot of girls feel they need to do all of these weird and wonderful things to look good, and they really don't. The best-looking girls don't do anything; they just sort of know they're beautiful, especially in jeans and a hoodie.
- I've started a little independent record label called 'Six String Productions' and recorded a couple of tunes, and I hope to do some more with some future artists next year. It's a real passion project of mine.
- I have three brothers; I'm the youngest of four.
- I do have a bit of a garden, and I'd love a hovercraft to get around it - one of the big four-seater ones with the fan on the back.
- We went with the St. Lawrence Experience, which is run by Joe Babbitt, who is a close friend now. We went out there for 10 days and we had the best week of our lives, and we've been going back since. We've been back three times now.
- I think it's pretty crazy to say you've been typecast at the age of 20 before you've even really started getting going.
