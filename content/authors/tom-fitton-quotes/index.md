- Clinton's problem was that many Americans didn't trust her because she was caught telling untruths - repeatedly - about her email system. She first told us it was simply a matter of convenience to use her unsecure, non-government email system. That wasn't true.
- Neither Mueller, the Obama FBI, DOJ, CIA, State Department, nor the Deep State ever had a good-faith basis to pursue President Trump on Russia collusion.
- The Watergate is a hotel in Washington where Nixon operatives broke in to steal campaign information from the Democratic Party. Nixon's people subsequently described that act as a 'third-rate burglary.' In the same manner, Clinton has described the FBI investigation of her email escapades as 'a security review.'

- The Left would pretend voter fraud is no big deal.
- In Washington, the ostensible story is rarely the real story.
- Unfortunately for the American people, the Obama-Clinton-Rice cabal that led to the Benghazi cover-up was far more interested in political-damage control than serious damage assessment.

- Americans weren't generally aware of Joe and Hunter Biden's shenanigans in Ukraine, but Obama's State Department certainly was, as was Ukraine, its pro-Russian newspaper sardonically referring to the soon to be then-Vice President Joe Biden showing up to protect his son's business in Ukraine.
- Our intelligence agencies have vast powers, and Obama used them illegally to spy on political opponents. This can't be allowed to stand.

- In 2009, during Pelosi's first speakership, we uncovered documents from the Department of Defense detailing her multiple requests for military air travel.
- In the best of circumstances, the Trump family business and questions about conflicts will be a burden to his presidency. There is no off-the-shelf ethics plan that would cover every possible conflict.

- Mass mailing ballots to voters depends on voter registration rolls that are notoriously error-ridden.

- Mail-in ballots are a huge source of potential voter fraud. For instance, ballots mailed to wrong addresses or large residential buildings might get intercepted.

- When the FOIA law was first being discussed, every federal agency opposed it.

- Is it now a crime for someone falsely accused to be upset about it? Mueller presumes guilt and then refuses to 'exonerate' President Trump. This turns our legal system upside down and shows the rule of law is no bar to smearing President Trump.

- For eight long years, the Obamas spent our tax dollars for a lavish jet-setting lifestyle.
- Bureaucrats serve their own interests first.
- While the Pentagon ultimately awards military contracts, there is a reason for the review process. The Senate's subcommittee on Military Construction's approval carries weight.
