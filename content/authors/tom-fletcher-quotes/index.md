- As a parent I know how challenging it can be to identify the right books and how rewarding it can be when you do find the right fit.

- I love being a dad.

- I enjoyed writing stories whenever there was call to do it at school, and started writing bad poetry when I was doing my GCSEs - like most people, I think.

- We wanted to write a book that we would have read as kids, and would love to read to our children.
- I'd go to Starbucks and order a frappuccino and blueberry muffin and that was me for the day. Not only would I beat myself up internally if I consumed anything else, I'd be in a foul mood if we were working somewhere there was no Starbucks. It was an obsession - and a deeply unhealthy one.
- If you are not able to look after yourself, you are not able to look after your kids.
- We had absolutely no experience in writing kids books and its a very competitive market. But we buy and read a lot of children's books and we felt that our books had that extra something we were always looking for.
