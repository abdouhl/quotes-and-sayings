- I think people enjoy finding out something genuinely new.
- My two great loves when I'm shooting are working with great actors and composing images.

- Actors enjoy being treated as ordinary people.
- What's fascinating about the Australians is they have this quality that they are impervious to majesty. They're not awed.

- If you look at Shakespeare's history plays, what the setting of monarchy allows is this extraordinary intensification of emotions and predicament.
- If you look at classic Hollywood films, they tend to shoot close-ups on quite long lenses and the background it out of focus. You know, it's just a mush.
- American cinema tends to express a patriotic relationship to national identity on a regular basis.
- I think the thumb print on the throat of many people is childhood trauma that goes unprocessed and unrecognized.
- Sometimes your body language is enough for an actor to know that you're not happy. And you don't really need to say it out loud if you deal with actors you know very well. And I don't think you really need to be explicit.
- After my grandfather's plane took enemy fire, he was denied permission to land at the first available airstrip. In that classic British bureaucratic way, they said he had to go back to your own airbase in the Midlands. They crashed between the coast and the airfield.

- Some films clearly seem to divide people. And I do think there's something incredibly exciting about the commonality of us as human beings, which some films are lucky enough to tap into.
- My films seem to be about men's struggle with failure.
- I appear to be drawn to iconic characters and what they reflect back to our cultures.
- Actors are programmed to see the worst. If you're talking about an actor's TV series, you say, 'I loved you last night.' And they go, 'What about the week before?' They immediately worry.
- I come from the kind of family where work is work; my parents always taught me that it's better to be doing something than sitting around doing nothing.

- I would say L.A. is more polite than London - it's a very careful place. People talk a lot in code.
- The thing that fascinates me is that the way I came to film and television is extinct. Then there were gatekeepers, it was prohibitively expensive to make a film, to be a director you had to be an entrepreneur to raise money.
- Well, I'm half Australian, half English and I live in London. That is the only reason I came upon this story. My Australian mother, Meredith Hooper, was invited in late 2007 by some Australian friends to make up a token Australian audience in a tiny fringe theater play reading of an unproduced, unrehearsed play called 'The King's Speech.'
- Some of my most special shooting experiences have been at weekends.
- I don't even like football.
- My dad said, 'The thing that I was told that was really helpful was that I mustn't be afraid of the things I was afraid of when I was five years old'. The shock of his childhood had put him in this defensive crouch against the world, and he needed to know that he had a nice wife and kids and it wasn't the same any more.
- I think I would say 'The King's Speech' is surprisingly funny, in fact the audiences in London, Toronto, LA, New York commented there's more laughter in this film than in most comedies, while it is also a moving tear-jerker with an uplifting ending.
- A lot of dramas get a bad name commercially because they are unremittingly bleak.
- I feel connected to the Second World War because my father lost his father in that war. So, through my dad and the effect it had on him of losing his father young, I always felt connected to the war. It goes back years, but it still feels to me as if we're completely living in it.
