- A lot of people know who I am before I've met them, which is a weird dynamic.
- Well my dad forced me into playing the violin when I was about three and it all started from there. I went to Suzuki for violin lessons, and you learn to play by ear instead of reading music.
- To be honest, I don't have a particular recipe, but I normally start with the chord progression and then I build it from there. I listen to a lot of jazz, so the chords are really important to me.
- It really scares me, the idea of keeping on growing and becoming more well-known. I don't like how my life has changed in some ways.
- I don't want to be set in music my whole life. I want to experience some of my youth not being Tom Misch, away from the expectations.
- I hate being recognised on nights out.
- I like jazz but actually I didn't love it enough to study it for four years. It was boring.
- I started playing guitar when I was nine and just fell in love with that - I've been playing nonstop ever since.
- I was always listening to music on headphones or working on something on my computer. I realised it wasn't healthy to be so reliant on creating stuff. I needed to be more sociable.
- I'd be making beats pretty much every day after school and it just grew and grew. I wasn't precious about my music. I just loved creating and putting stuff out there.
- I first heard Loyle Carner on SoundCloud in 2014.
- I was doing music tech as a subject and learned how to use Logic Pro and that's when I kind of had a platform to put my ideas on. It all just went from there.
- I forget that I can play guitar and that I can perform very well. It's like having an alternative life.
- I don't think I have a great voice, but I started singing on my tracks and they did a lot better. So I thought, 'let's give this a go then!'
