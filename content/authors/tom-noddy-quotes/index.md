- I have no time for a vacation.
- On good days, I've done bubbles with as many as 38 faces - a row of pentagons, a row of hexagons, and another row of pentagons on bottom.
- If you look at the Karamazov Brothers on TV, they're really small and the heart is taken out of their act. That's true for most variety acts. I'm an exception. When the camera comes in close and looks at those soap bubbles, you can really see what bubbles do.
- I've been called a career hippie. I like that, I like that a lot.
- I had no plans to become a responsible person.

- The mid '70s was the golden age. A lot of things were being born on the street then, and there was a lot of experimentation.

- Bubbles are round for the same reason that planets are spherical. The universe itself is like bubbles.
- There is a dream on the street. I hear it constantly - finding a piece of land, raising food, building a house. I hear talk of hopelessness. The price of land, you know. Housing is impossible. They are trapped in a cycle. How can you ask for a job after you've been sleeping in the bushes all night?
- I had to find a way to get off the streets because it was too windy. So I started organizing variety shows of street performers. I would rent a hall, cafe or bar so I could put on a show. I did that for years before the 'Tonight Show With Johnny Carson' heard about this odd thing I did with bubbles.
- When I blow the head off a glass of Guinness or eat a slice of white bread, there are so many bubbles!
- Bubbles only break for a few different reasons, so if I can avoid those things, I can get a lot of things to happen.

- I'd do the Mount St. Helen's trick, where the smoke comes out of the top. I wouldn't even have to look at people. I'd hear that 'Ahhhh!'
- I love hands-on science and teaching the kids. I love to see kids experiment with things that they can make happen. Not just something you read the directions to and put it together that way. Things that can be constructed, something they can touch. What a great day when you can touch a child's mind with these ideas.
- It's an electrical network, isn't it? It's molecules in space... and they're linked to each other electrically. Which is to say, one end of a soap molecule is attracted to a nearby water molecule electrically. The bubble is this network. The whole thing is inter-dependent.
- I've never had much and I've never needed much. If I had only two bucks in my pocket, I knew I could spend it because I could always do another show of some kind, even on a sidewalk.

- There is a lot of science in bubbles. They are just like our weather system. The earth is, in effect, trapped inside a liquid sphere, the troposphere, where our weather forms. The bright colors on the outside of a bubble are just varying thicknesses of bubble, just like the varying thicknesses of clouds.
- Mathematicians are stiff abstract guys. They'll tell you they don't need the physical world. But then when I show them my bubbles they're like little children.
- When I do the dodecahedron with the science audiences, I'll point out that I can only do three of the five forms with bubbles, since bubbles only join at three-way corners. The two I can't do are the ones that represent water and air. That always gets a big laugh from the mathematicians. They see the irony in it.

- I had dropped out of Memphis State University after two years because I felt the real world was too exciting.
- I took a job at a factory in New Jersey to try to save money to go to Europe. When I took the job, I set a date for quitting. I was going to hitchhike around, be a hippie, see the world. I just wanted to be responsible long enough to get up the money to get there and trip around.

- The bubbles are thinner than wavelengths of light.
- Bubbles are very simplified versions of some of the basic laws of the universe.
- Bubbles are weird things. They're not fragile. They're infinitely flexible. They're not what we think they are.
