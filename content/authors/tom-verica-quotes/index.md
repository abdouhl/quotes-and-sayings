- Myself, I happen to be married to an African-American woman, and we're together 17 years. We took a few trips to the South 15 years ago, and we were sobered by some of the reactions people had - how subtle or not-so-subtle their reactions were.
- I started my career as an actor, but I've been a director for 15 years now.
- I remember seeing this picture my mother had of Dick Clark. It didn't inspire me to be an actor or anything, but when I did 'American Dreams' with Dick Clark, my mother came out, and she showed him this picture of them that was taken 35 years earlier. It was great.
- I played in 'From the Earth to the Moon,' working with Tom Hanks. He is a great guy, very smart.

- If we had a perfect world, we can do 'Scandal' during the day and 'Murder' at night - that's the optimal thing.
- Having spent a lot of time on sets, I was really interested in the overall storytelling aspect of shows and projects.

- Right before 'American Dreams,' I started to pursue these avenues, like short films and getting into a couple night courses to really study photography and cinematography, and the language of visual storytelling.
- I am definitely most proud of 'American Dreams.'
