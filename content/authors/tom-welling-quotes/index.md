- If I was invincible, maybe I would take up some extreme sports.
- I have so much chaos in my life, it's become normal. You become used to it. You have to just relax, calm down, take a deep breath and try to see how you can make things work rather than complain about how they're wrong.
- I love going to movies. It's just big, it takes you away, you can escape into it.

- I love having time to prepare my lines and more time off.

- Modeling, for me, was not fulfilling. I didn't see the point - although I was able to travel a great deal. I lived in Italy, Germany, and Spain, but I wasn't devoted to it.
- I think I was brought up in a respectful household.
