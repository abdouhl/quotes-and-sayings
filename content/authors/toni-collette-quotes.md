- Hal Ashby is one of my favorite filmmakers.
- I believe the more important thing is your mind and your heart. Those two things are the most ignored parts of our beings.
- I wish I had more patience.
- 'Krampus' had a certain originality about it, so I jumped on board.
- In a lot of films, forever it's been boy-meets-girl, and thank God for films like - I know it's going to sound ridiculous - 'Frozen.' I was so excited for my daughter to be able to watch a love story between two sisters instead of some stupid prince.
- I wouldn't play glamour for glamour.
- I think being the conventional beauty is limiting, so I'm glad I'm not that. If I looked different, I wouldn't have the great opportunities I've had.
- Mothers are so awesome. They do so much. They wear so many hats and have very passionate relationships with their kids, and with life, and I think it's a real balance having your own existence and then being this responsible, kind of loving person in someone else's life or several other people's lives.
- The people who are most attractive to me are those who feel most comfortable in their skin - there's a sense of self-acceptance.
- I've never had a game plan. It's just if something comes along and it feels right in the moment.
- I think that the Japanese culture is one of the very few cultures left that is its own entity. They're just so traditional and so specific in their ways. It's kind of untouched, it's not Americanized.
- My plan is to have no plan. If you know what plan you have, life has its own ideas and will take you in any direction it pleases. So my idea about life is to just be open to it and to go with the flow and go with my gut.
- If I get dressed up, and my boyfriend says, 'You look gorgeous,' I kinda feel funny. I don't know if I'm particularly comfortable with being attractive.
- I love working. I love it! It makes me feel awake and alive and appreciative, as does my family, but in a different way. If I was told I couldn't do it, I think I would wither and die.
- I kind of realized I could sing, so I played around with that for a while. And that led me to acting in itself, which I came more passionate about by the age of 15.
- An accent in a way can be an entry into a character.
- There are actors who are really fantastically talented at being natural on screen and appearing to be themselves, but I like the challenge of becoming somebody else.
- Travelling's so much better when you know you've got a lovely home to go back to.
- I have trouble admitting I'm wrong.
- I guess in Australia every film is sort of an indie film because there are no studios.
- My face moves, unlike some actors' do. I guess it's kind of a response to what's happening internally.
- I'm very happy with my lot. I like the variety I get. You don't want to spend your life repeating yourself. It's true of any kind of artist, you want to explore as wide and far as you can go, so that's what I've been trying to do.
- I grew up watching a lot of American television and so the American sound has been in my psyche somehow for a long time and is quite familiar and so that does make it easier.
- I want variety. I want versatility. Otherwise, I'm wasting the opportunity of being an actor, which is all about variation and change.
- The better you know yourself, the better your relationship with the rest of the world.
- I love rides. I'm such an immature person.
- I find it strange that actors are on the covers of magazines.
- I just never want to repeat myself. I also don't want to be bored in life. The great luxury of being an actor is you get to be different people, and I would hate to be repetitive.
- I love holidays. It's such a wonderful time for the whole family to be together and not have to worry about schedules and that kind of thing.
- People are so fearful about opening themselves up. All you want to do is to be able to connect with other people. When you connect with other people, you connect with something in yourself. It makes you feel happy. And yet it's so scary - it makes people feel vulnerable and unsafe.
- The potential strength of female friendship and the bonds that can be formed, especially over a lifelong relationship, is very profound.
- I think it's important to relax in general. I don't try to save up my relaxing for one month period of the year; it's kind of a daily practice that I've tried to remain aware of.
- I hate it when the mother is just the mother in movies.
- My 20s were totally bonkers. I was living out of a suitcase and burning the candle at both ends. But I tell you - I am totally over it.
- I don't try to live the life of my character but I think it's inevitable that there is some carry-over into your life.
- I've done a couple of films in Philadelphia, and it's a great, great town.
- Planning and worrying and chaos in your mind? Forget it. What's the point of that?
- I played a lot of mothers before I even became a mother. It wasn't like I set out to be some sort of mother crusader.
- We were just covered in dirt the whole time. It was so hot - and that was in winter. I can not imagine what it's like in summer and how the people who actually live out there survive.
- I have to say, I feel really lucky. I've had a lot of great characters to play.
- Meditation is an essential aspect of my life.
- Sometimes it was so quiet, it's frightening. It really prioritizes things.
- When I look at a character, I never look at the size of the role. I always look at the whole person, no matter how much they're featured in the movie.
- Also, I think having a musicality about me that helps in identifying different things in languages and getting them right.
- Oh, I definitely want to direct. I have young children. My job is already big enough, and I imagine it will be even more so as a director, and I don't want to miss out on them growing up. I'm going to wait until they're a bit older before I leap into that seat.
- I don't mind where I work, it's really nice to be able to travel around and taste the flavours of different countries.
- Independent films have a certain freedom about them - there isn't so much at stake in terms of money. I think they're more interesting because they're not watered down to appeal to the masses. They tend to have a unique voice.
- To be able to create a character and tell a story is a crazy way to make a living. I feel so lucky to be able to do this.
- I just want to find some inner peace, and I think I'm getting there, slowly but surely.
- I'm starting to realise that there are certain themes that I return to, those being that there is no such thing as normal, and people finding their voice and living authentically. And also that you can be influenced and helped through an extended family.
- I've been extremely happy and fortunate in terms of what I've achieved and the experiences I've been given.
- I love kids, so working with them wasn't a problem.
- I prefer comedies when they come from a dark kind of place and have a reality to it.
- I try to play real people who inspire me through something in their journey.
- Lars Von Trier is a genius. Every film he makes is so honest and powerful.
- I like being married, but it was never something I felt I had to do.
- Cameron and I actually do wear the same size. It made it very easy for the wardrobe department.
- I really only take roles that I love and that I have some kind of innate compulsion or need to tell that story. Although it's almost like I have no control over it. It's like they choose me.
- The one thing I want to do - and I am doing - is starting my own production company, for me to produce and direct in the future. Have a bit more say and control - become the storyteller more than just the character. I want to choose the story, plant the seed, and watch it grow. I just want to have a bit more involvement.
- I'm not Buddhist, but I am drawn to it because it seems the most beneficial of organised religions and the most compassionate.
- My life is fancy dress, so I prefer not to do it in my spare time.
- I'm glad that it was so physical and so isolated.
- Whether it's a movie I'm in or not, if there's a good movie, and it's low budget, and you know everyone's done it just because they were passionate about it and they cared for it, if it has any kind of audience, it's just a wonderful outcome.
- I think when I was younger, I used to sort of long to be a part of films that were really gritty and hardcore in a way.
- I believe in nurturing the inner world.
- I'm a fan of music, some rock music. But I like many types of music. But I suppose a kind of longstanding love of specific bands would be Radiohead, Wilco, Neil Young, Tom Waits, REM.
- Being in the desert was brilliant and it was hard.
- I can't imagine a world without music.
- To tell you the truth, my father says I came out of the womb literally singing and dancing, as though there was a spotlight on me. When I ask what I was like when I was little, they just say 'loud.'
- When I watch a movie, someone's beauty isn't what engages me: it's what's going on internally. And I imagine it's what the audience thinks, too.
- After 'Muriel's Wedding,' I first went to America, and I was sent all these scripts about fat girls overcoming hurdles. Something in me knew not to go down that road, even if it was a good script.
- I don't feel I owe anyone anything.
- I hate sitting around labouring over things. I love just getting into it.
- The way a character looks reflects what's on the inside. I can make myself look really bad, and I can make myself look kind of gorgeous. It's not about me; it's about the character.
- I think there's an inevitable fact that I somehow absorb part of what I'm doing, because that's what you're constantly thinking about, and that's what's in your veins, and that's what you get up at 4:30 in the morning for and fall into bed after.
- If I hadn't had acting, I would probably have imploded.
