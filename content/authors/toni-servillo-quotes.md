- Acting requires a lot of discipline to go with the obsession. It's a path of knowledge, and of self-knowledge. Sometimes you get lost on the path. And then you find yourself again.
- Neapolitans are extremely empathetic, whereas the typical northern attitude is more about not showing or sharing your feelings.
- Directors are denied a great pleasure, which is that of being on stage.
- Politicians in Italy seem to spend so much time giving interviews, they don't have time to make the laws.
- I think that beauty can injure you to death. It can cause an injury that can never be cured. Or it can so traumatise you, your life changes direction. The beauty of the harmony of nature that is forever lost, or a daily rite that you perform, or diving into the sea for a swim. Those experiences are going to mark you.

- A solid theatrical education can only improve a screen performance. It gives you a fuller capacity to read a script and understand a character, for one thing. It's important to alternate between the two activities.
- Each single gesture of art must be daring. One must not be concerned with the side-effects.
