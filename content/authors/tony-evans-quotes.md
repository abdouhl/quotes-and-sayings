- Far too often, we have limited the definition of the Church. While not in all cases, in many cases, 'Church' has become an informational, inspirational weekly gathering rather than the group of people that God has ordained from Heaven to operate on his behalf on Earth in order to bring Heaven's viewpoint into history.
- Until we take seriously God's definition of the church and stop just 'having church,' we will not see transformation in our society.

- The history of our country has been driven by a Judeo-Christian worldview, and so that has dominated the landscape. So it's important that we recognize the lordship of Jesus Christ without apology in our emphasis on prayer.
- In the urban community, the church doesn't just take people to Heaven; it feeds, clothes, and houses them. It teaches them how to read and gets them jobs. The church should be doing all that.

- Separation of church and state should never mean separation of God and right.

- We can never get around to being one nation under God if we can't even get around to being one Church under God.
- Gone must be the days of only pointing fingers at others to fix what they may never fix. Our nation's ills are not merely the result of corruption or racism, although these are evil. Our troubles can also be traced directly to ineffective Christians.

- Anyone who knows me knows that I love football.
- I condemn racism on all levels, whether personal or systemic.

God's first concern is what is happening, or not happening, in His house.
- We've got to move from membership to discipleship to being full-time Christians, not part-time saints. That means operating comprehensively on the value system of Heaven as we move about in history.
