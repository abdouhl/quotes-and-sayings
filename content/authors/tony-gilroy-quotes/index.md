- I wanted to try before I got too old to try to do a big movie and I'd been looking for something to do that was interesting enough to spend those two years of my life on.
- When I start something, I know people I am working with, it's a project they're interested in.
- Developing films with directors, developing films with actors, is a poor percentage play for a screenwriter.
- I prefer writing originals.
- Ambiguity depletes as your budget rises.
- I love the idea of spies in love. How would it work between two people who were so programmed to lie and be suspicious, who have a whole life based on pretence?
- I can't imagine directing from someone else's script.
- Once a film costs a certain amount of money, things have to round off.
- The writing is really hard. You're alone. It really pulls it out of you. You pull it out of your head. But when you're a director, you're shopping - you're picking this actor, you're picking this scene. It's like the most intense kinetic high-speed shopping of all time. You sit in a chair and it will all come rushing at you like a wind tunnel.
- I like knowing where I am in action sequences if I'm supposed to.
- No one should feel sorry for a successful screenwriter.
- I'm trained to button scenes and round things off, and I get rewarded for doing that.
- I have written a bunch of scripts that have not gotten produced, much more so early in my career than later.
- I worked for a lot of directors.
- Corporations are like countries now, there's a king, there are serfs, there's a court, basically everything but moats. They're feudal societies, and there are good ones and bad ones.
- I don't like to be crazy on different levels all of the time.
- I like movies that pop, that have a little bit of candy on, that freedom to have a little bit of extra fun, but are rooted in real behaviour. Rooted in cause and effect, never violating reality.
- I spend a lot of time in a sort of free state when I'm writing in the beginning and sketching.
- You can't teach someone to be imaginative.
- The main thing for me is I really like strong endings. If there's a strong ending, you can take more time in the beginning, your first act can be really quite different.
- If you think about it, episodic filmmaking has not been something that people have really done.
- I never really like it when other writers talk about coming in behind people and rewriting.
- I like emotions, but I really don't like sentimentality, and I don't like when things break their spell.
- Different people work different ways.
- I don't remember writing anything until I wrote my college application.
- The people in the Philippines are so extraordinarily nice.
- The screenwriters I know share a few personality traits and one of them is anxiety.
- I think what I've recognized over the years is that I'm very, very bingey, extremely bingey when it comes to writing.
- You change or you hide your head in the sand.
- I've never taken a job on anything I didn't want to do.
- A reversal is just anything that's a surprise. It's a way of keeping the audience interested.
- I used to be, when I was young, I used to be extremely regular and very organized.
- Everyone I know who used to be in the intelligence community is moving into the corporate world.
- Fear changes everything. We're animals, and when we get afraid we act like animals. I'm not exempt from that.
