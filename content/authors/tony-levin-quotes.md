- Yes, alas, I've been on some recording sessions where the music wasn't good. Not so many, really, considering how many I've done. It's a very awkward situation because to do a recording well you focus on the positive of what will make the piece better.
- We all have different musical instincts, and I think they're precious and should be respected.
- Like most musicians, I'm good at becoming immersed in the music that I am currently working on. We seldom lift up our heads to contemplate even the music we will be doing in the future, let alone what we've done in the past.
- People should decide what success means for them, and not be distracted by accepting others' definitions of success.
- I'm in that comfortable niche where I'm not that famous and sometimes people do need to put a barrier between them and their followers. When you're real famous you need to do that but I'm not that famous so I don't need that kind of barrier.
- The most fun is to play clubs, because you actually get to see the people.
- I'm a player and I do it because I love playing whether it's for my album or someone else's.
- John was great to work with, and a lot of fun. I wish I'd had the chance to make more music with him, of course, and to get to know him better.
- Like many musicians, I don't look back much... only concentrate on what music I'm doing, and occasionally look ahead.
- From my time in 'King Crimson,' I'd describe a Progressive band as one that keeps trying to break musical barriers, and keeps trying to do new music.
- Through the years I've found that I prefer live playing to recording. I still do lots of recording - but I treasure the live shows.
- For me, if the music is good, whether the artist is famous or unknown, I love being part of the music and contributing what I can to the bass end.
