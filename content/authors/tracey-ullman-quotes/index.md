- I like infomercials.
- I don't see myself as a stand-up comic doing cynical, mean-spirited or disrespectful stuff. I'm very aware that I don't like to disrespect people too much.

- I used to dress up and impersonate our next-door neighbor, Miss Cox. She wore rubber boots, a wool hat, and her nose always dripped.

- I like going to France, because no one knows who I am.
- I've always had to create my own markets and I've always been at a juncture in my career.
- I never worked with a dialogue coach before, but I'd hate it if an American did a British accent and didn't do it well. It would be insulting.

- I grew up with Jilly and Tamsin driving Volvos. But I wasn't one of them... I always felt more comfortable with Cockney and working-class people. My heroes were the Beatles and people like Michael Caine.
- I became an American in 2006. It got me thinking about what is my America and what's my perception of America.

- My mum would like to see me on the cover of 'Good Housekeeping' demonstrating children's toys with some nice lipstick on.

- I worked with Paul McCartney for a while and saw what it does to you to be treated like a god for twenty years.
- I don't get very involved in the L.A. scene. When you do get invited out, you are expected to be on all the time. It's just wearying.

- I've always been a misfit.
- It's the poignancy and sadness in things that gets to me.
- It's sometimes shocking to find out what people really believe in.

- My influences were Peter Sellers and the great British character actors.
- Work is important to me. I want to do things for principle, not just for the sake of doing them.
- I'm still that little girl who lisped and sat in the back of the car and threw vegetables at the back of her head when we drove home from the market. That never goes.
- You become so encapsulated in this world of being a star. People listen to what you say, you have this voice, it becomes unreal and you become far removed from the people you came from.
