- All my clients eat. Madonna has a very healthy appetite. She doesn't eat processed food, she's very conscious of the quality of the things she eats but she has treats - she loves cupcakes.
- I have done research about people who think they're doing movements and people - like Madonna and professional dancers - who are actually 'performing' movements. The people who can connect and perform during their workout get results way above and beyond the people who are just going through the motions.
- Juice fasting destroys your metabolic rate. I see a lot of women who are like, 'Oh, I lost seven pounds and then I gained 10.' That's not what detoxification is about.
- I hate diets and I love eating.
- I heard a lot in school, 'You've got a really great talent, but there's no way you're going to be a dancer with that body.'
- If you want a dancer's body, dance. Dance aerobics is my favourite cardio. It's very frustrating if people think you have to become a dancer to do it - you don't.
- Oftentimes, heavy weights can tear the muscle fiber causing it to bulk, but using a lighter weight for a longer duration and allowing your body to move in many different ways to target all of the muscles will lengthen them without tearing.
- I think it's very important to feed the body what it craves and not be in your head about it, panicking, carrying around some calorie-counting wheel in your bag or something equally absurd. I'm really not a fan of that at all.
- I tell people to be thankful that Madonna is showing that it's possible to be ageless - people should applaud and celebrate that. Anybody who criticises her is just jealous!
- It's not just the light weights that give a long toned look with the Tracy Anderson Method, it's using the body in different rotations while contracting and releasing the muscle, causing it to stretch and lengthen.
- I really wanted to make it as a ballet dancer to make my mom proud. But it didn't happen.
- Do you need to train two hours a day? Probably not. The reason why my celebrity clients have to train two hours a day is because their endurance level is so strong. For Madonna to get results and keep results, it's like a professional athlete training - she has to push harder.
- Madonna is an athlete; she has to be treated like a professional athlete. She doesn't work out for six hours a day, though, like some of the press says. She never works out for more than two hours a day, and then only when she has the time.
- There is no quick easy way to the body you want... commit yourself now to your workout and get started.
- You need to be dedicated to your workout, whatever you choose.
- A lot of women use pregnancy as an excuse to let their bodies go, and that's the worst thing.
