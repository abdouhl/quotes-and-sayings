- We play Amazing Race on New Year's Eve. My mom or aunt makes a whole list of things that we have to find, and we split up into teams.

- I'm not planning on doing anything other than trying to be as best I can.
- I have to keep improving.
- The one thing that I do have that I really like is I framed some of my jerseys. In college, I played for Team U.S.A. I framed some of those jerseys. I framed my jersey when I got drafted by the Padres. I do have my first stolen base ever from when I stole a base in 2015. I have the actual base, which is pretty neat.
- I've always been a little bit doubted, and I've tried to go out and prove people wrong.
- The offseason's a big deal for everyone.
- I feel like everyone puts a lot of question on me, what I'm going to do offensively, but I'd like to affect the game in a lot of ways. If I can walk, I walk. If I can hit a homer, if I can bunt.

- I think I'm athletic enough to do anything.
- I have the speed. People said, 'Just hit the ball on the ground, slap the ball, just get on base.' But I wanted to be able to hit home runs. I wanted to be able to bunt, steal bases, play defense.
