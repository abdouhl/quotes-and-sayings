- We were a religious, practicing, Catholic family - Mass together on Sunday, Catholic schools, and parents who practiced everything they preached. A great gift was their total absence of any derogatory talk about people of any race or culture and we were on a street of many faiths, though no other races at that early time.
- Visits to 'the country' were very important to me growing up, especially working on the farm, experiencing all the wonders of cats and chickens and pigs and calves and outhouses!
- I feel blessed to have had such a background, where animals, food raising, harvesting and canning were a natural part of life.
- Without butterflies, the world would soon have few flowers. There is enough room in the sky for all flyers.
