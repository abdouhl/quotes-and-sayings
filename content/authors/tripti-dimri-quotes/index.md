- During my school days, I'd tell my friends that one day I would be a television star. But my parents weren't too keen about me venturing into acting. Eventually, they gave in and allowed me to start modelling.
- I thought I have no chance in films and so wanted to do TV. I was very confident that I might become a star on small screen.
- I used to be a people pleaser, always have a smile on my face.
- I like trekking and staying in tents, meeting new people and eating good food.
- Every character, every story that you do, it teaches you a lot.
- As a child, I used to tell my mother that one day I will come on TV for one of the Ekta Kapoor shows, like 'Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi.'
- I have wanted to act, ever since I was a kid.
- I want to tell good stories, real stories with a message and I want to play meaty characters that drive the story.
- Every department from the director to the art takes their time to set up, similarly as an actor it is your responsibility to take your time. Never be in a rush.
- Prepping for any character is the most important thing because if you don't know how she walks, talks or thinks, you can't do justice to it.
- I used to get very nervous and couldn't even pronounce my name in front of my camera.
- A lot of people have said I look Bengali!
- I love to travel and have a special connection with the mountains.
- I could relate to the naive and young Bulbbul, before the character transforms. It was easier to understand her mind set and how she looked at things. But it was difficult to internalise her transformation. It was like playing two different personalities.
- To be an actor, you have to have patience.
- I can't beg for work. One day or the other, you will get work.

- Whenever I need a break from work, I go for a vacation.
- I have started to respect myself and my decisions a little more, love myself a little more because I think self love is the most important form of love.

- I am a very shy and an introvert by nature and I take a lot of time to open up.
- Post 'Laila Majnu,' I was just sitting at home because I wanted to be part of a story that is as special as 'Bulbbul.'
- I had said 'no' to a lot of projects, and that's when I got 'Bulbbul.'
- As an actor, I wouldn't reject a scene because I felt awkward or disturbed.
- Before 'Laila Majnu' released, I would tell friends that after the movie will release, I won't be able to buy groceries freely because people will recognise me. But that didn't happen. I was heartbroken but I dealt with it.
- People are living with a 'live and let live' attitude which I like here in Mumbai.
- If I miss anything about Delhi, it is my friends and the community living style.
- When I told my parents that I wanted to be an actor, they were like, 'How can you be an actor? You have to go out and interact with people! You hardly talk to our relatives!'
- My all-time favourite actor is Meryl Streep. She can do anything and everything. She's so good in 'Sophie's Choice.' She changes her accent so well, which is something actors in India don't do although we should, so that we can be more authentic to our craft.
- See, if I was a filmmaker and I was putting my money in a film, I would definitely want actors who can bring the audience to the theatres, otherwise what is the point of it? Because I will be spending a lot of money on the film.

- As actors, I really feel that unless you don't believe in the part, you won't be able to portray it on screen.
- I think my film 'Laila Majnu' was in theatres for 7 days and I was very excited. I attended as many shows I could in those 7 days because I was seeing myself on the big screen for the very first time. I was very excited. But then, sometimes there were 20 people, sometimes 5 or 1 or 2, that really broke my heart.
- In fact, I signed 'Laila Majnu' before the release of 'Poster Boyz.'
- During childhood, I spent every summer vacation, visiting relatives in Chamoli district in Uttarkhand.
- If I am not talented and don't know my job, then no matter what I do, I am not going to get work.
- Why we give power to others that they can affect us so much?

- People talk about going crazy in love, but no one knows what happens when one actually faces it.

- One day, I was auditioning for some other thing and my friend was auditioning for 'Laila Majnu.' She asked me to come with her so that we could leave together. While I was waiting, the guy who was taking the audition said, 'Why don't you give it a try.'
