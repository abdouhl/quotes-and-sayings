- I used to make everything myself. I used to do my own hair, make my own costumes, write my own jokes, and write my own songs. There were definitely some days where I had to choose between having tights that didn't have holes in them or having to buy makeup or something I needed for a show.
- With Trixie, people like that I look like this fabricated painted creation, but all my comedy and my songs come from a place of reality. It's like the man behind the curtain - it's the crying clown - that's what works for people with Trixie. It's the dichotomy of someone looking like a toy but then, you know, speaking and singing like a real boy.
- People are slowly realizing that they're looking at drag all the time. 'Mrs. Doubtfire.' 'Real Housewives.' Peewee Herman. Don't let calling it drag make you uncomfortable.
- Something 'Drag Race' is really good at is portraying us as artists but also human beings. And normal human beings don't know everything. They don't have all the answers.
- When you unbox a My Little Pony or a Strawberry Shortcake doll, you were hit with a sweet, impossibly perfect fragrance of fresh, machine-made plastic oftentimes infused with floral and fruity notes to bring the toy to life. That third dimension of sensory experience made the toy so real to me.
- I'm an artist who happens to be in drag. And I think that's why my drag is a little different.
- In the real world, people go against my beliefs all the time, and I don't make it my place to - like, I'm not super confrontational.
- One of my trophies of 'Drag Race' is getting to meet Katya.
- I grew up playing guitar and writing music, and I always wanted to be a songwriter and a singer and play the guitar. But while I was finishing college, my drag became lucrative, so I had to pursue what was going to pay the bills - and doing comedy as Trixie was something that I was able to market.
- I remember being obsessed with Christina Aguilera's 'Stripped.' That was her peak, and she is such an amazing singer. Plus, I was a little gay boy, and the music video for 'Beautiful' existed, so obviously I was affected.
- People on a daily basis walk up to me, panic, and tell me something extremely graphic and violent about their life.
- I looooove Jason Isbell.
- I want to look otherworldly, like I was made in a factory.
- I'm such a Shangela fan. I think she exemplifies 'Drag Race' greatness. She's like the Tiffany 'New York' Pollard of 'Drag Race.' She's like a patron saint of reality TV.
- Northern Wisconsin, where I'm from, is so ridiculously rural.
- I lived deep in the country in northern Wisconsin. I didn't have any neighbors or anything, so in the summers, I played guitar for hours and hours every day until I was about 18. I never thought about combining it with drag, 'cause to me, well, drag queens don't play guitar. Now I'm like, 'You idiot, that's an opportunity.'
- The best way to create emotional or spiritual distance between me and another person is for them to come up to me and go, 'yaassssss.'
- That's something I like about drag - I get to do everything. Collaborative arts are hard for me because I don't really like to relinquish control.
- My favorite drag queens are Tammie Brown and Katya, so I like my drag queens a little left of sanity.
- I'm an optimistic realist. I kind of expect the worst but prepare for the best.
- My look and my character come from my experiences as a child. I wasn't allowed to have girl toys, and I grew up poor. I also had a rough relationship with my stepdad.
- I've lost 'Drag Race' twice. I know how, with one bad day, it could just end.
- To me, drag is about doing whatever you want, and nobody says anything. And 'Drag Race' is about doing what you're told and having it evaluated. I hate being judged.
- Any time there is an economic downturn or political strife, lipstick sales skyrocket. If you have a hard day, it's this $14 thing that lifts your day. I think drag has that same lipstick effect.
- I like Aimee Mann. Her album 'Mental Illness' is so good.
- I've always been obsessed with Michelle Branch, Avril Lavigne, Melissa Etheridge.
- Some people say that 'Drag Race' is about glory and immortalizing yourself in the Hall of Fame. For me, it's about shaking RuPaul down for her money.
- I don't expect a lot of people who love drag to also be like, 'I love 'Drag Race,' and then I got to hear my Chris Stapleton album.' Not necessarily an obvious crossover.
- I'm like the Justin Bieber of the drag world.
- I never check my bank account. I know that sounds crazy. But I don't know how much is in there. I never know how much is in there. I have an idea - I have a bottom line - but I never look because I always make believe there's never anything in there.
- When I was on 'Drag Race,' it felt like a serious competition going on between drag queens... and then Katya and I were also there.
- I've always said drag queens are like Swiss Army knives. Most come from having to take $50-a-show pay and doing their own costume, wig, music and jokes.
- Katya is literally my flesh and blood. Best friend status.
- I don't think gay guys are in touch with how many fabulous divas we have that actually play their own instruments and write their own music, too.
- I love Monet X Change.
- I live in reality, and I know at any moment I could stop getting the phone calls and nobody wants to hear me sing or tell jokes anymore.
- I guess I just believe in Trixie Mattel, and I believe in the work. I don't think I'm better than anybody else, but I really think that I'm hilarious and beautiful.
- I love John Denver. Townes Van Zandt is one of my all-time favorites.
- As drag queens and as comic people, we listen to our own artistic compass all the time.
- I don't pull punches at all, and I write my material for adults. But if kids like it, they can come watch it. I'll never change anything about what I do for anyone. I kind of think that's why kids like me. If you're a teenager, and there's someone onstage talking to you like an adult, that's good.
- If I have a show at night, I like to spend the whole day alone in silence. I know that might be crazy.
- Katya and I, as a yin and a yang, we pretty much represent the entire, full gambit of talent, you know? Together, there's not really much we can't do.
- When I'm in drag, I don't always want to be spoken to, but I love being looked at. Nobody puts that much work into how they look to be ignored.
- I didn't start drag because I thought it would be a ticket to anything. I did it for my own narcissistic fulfilment. When I started selling records, going on tour, doing TV... I never expected any of it.
- Some of my favorite drag queens are women.
- Shangela and I are both the type of queens who will taffy-pull 15 minutes of fame into something solid.
- Drag is pastiche and parody and satire. Drag queens are never meant to be stars. We make fun of stars. Drag queens are the people that 'point' at the star.
- As a kid, I wasn't allowed to have girl toys, but I would take my cousin's My Little Pony and smell it. That weird, synthetic, fruity-sweet smell - that's how I wanted to look. I wanted to look like this fabricated toy. I wanted to look like you could pull a string on my back, and I would say, like, six catchphrases.
- 'Drag Race' is sort of like trying to lift weights - like, 50 pounds when you should've been lifting 20.
- I think people are slowly realizing that don't have to be looking in a mirror to enjoy something. And they're realizing that watching a show with drag queens in it doesn't make you gay any more then listening to rap makes you black.
- I always say you can be great at drag and not great at 'Drag Race,' and you can be great at 'Drag Race' and not great at drag.
- When someone says 'Yasss queen!' to me, I turn around and, X-Men style, run through a wall. You'll never hear from me again.
- I listened to a lot of what my grandparents listened to: George Jones, Johnny Cash - a lot of old country singers. Patsy Cline.
- 'Drag Race' doesn't claim to represent drag as a whole. 'Drag Race' is a reality show. If you see real drag shows, we just do drag and respect each other's art and who your real identity is - name, gender, hair color, anything.
- I have definitely had guys walk up to me, put their arm around me, and when they walk away, my shoulder smells like taco meat.
- I want to literally quit drag and go live in the woods somewhere and write music for my favorite female singers, like Miley Cyrus or Kacey Musgraves. I would love to be able to write music for them and hear these women I admire sing my songs. That would be like doing drag without having to get into drag myself.
- I'm not good at anything! I can do, like, two voices.
- I hate drag. It's extremely uncomfortable. It's awful. I'm in a full corset and pads and giant wigs.
- I'm very proud of my career. A lot of people get their career from the judges of 'Drag Race' saying they're great. I had to go and build that reputation from the ground up.
- When I walked in on 'Drag Race' and saw Katya, I had no idea she was gonna be funny, because she was stunning. She had this perfect red lip, I remember looking into her eyes and being like, 'This is a woman!' Then she was really funny. She kind of presents normal, and it's a one-two punch with the comedy.
- I think being young and, like, 14, 15, you feel like a weirdo, and playing guitar with my grandpa in my grandma's kitchen is probably my fondest memories I'll ever have.
- For years, 'Drag Race' was gay people's best kept secret. When I started doing drag, people didn't know anything about it. Look at it now: it's like it's gone from black and white to IMAX.
- I always tell my mom that if she would have just bought me a Barbie when I was little, I would have gone into real estate.
- Drag will always find a way to be weird.
- My grandpa was a country singer, and I started learning guitar from him, just at the kitchen table when I was younger, and I got really into it.
- People don't realize 'Drag Race' is a certain percent competition, but it's also a game show. There's a certain amount of throwing dice and spinning wheels, and there are twists and turns all the time. Part of it is also having the right idea and pulling the right look together that day. We're all making choices in the moment.
- Trixie Mattel is a product of bad things that happened to me, and it's how I deal with things. It's wonderful.
- Dark comedy helped me survive.
- 'All Stars' is a weird game. The rules are weird. However, I think 'All Stars' mirrors the real industry much more closely than normal seasons of 'Drag Race' do. In the real world of entertainment, it really is about the impressions you leave on your brothers and sisters in the room, and that's kind of what it is about.
- Drag is great way to get people to pay attention to me, but it's a difficult way to get people to take me seriously as a musician. So it's a weird Catch-22. It's like a gimmick that gets them to pay attention, but when they see my image, they're like, 'There's no way this is going to have any legitimacy to it.'
- I always say that drag queens are like an exaggeration of women, and I'm like an exaggeration of drag queens. People ask, 'Why do you do your makeup so differently?' and I always say, 'Well, in a subversive art form, ask yourself why so many drag queens do their makeup exactly the same.' If you can do anything, why does everybody do the same thing?
- I remember seeing RuPaul in 'The Brady Bunch Movie,' when she says to Jan, 'Girl, you better work.' And I froze it in my mind forever.
- I'm most proud of my career as a touring comedian and musician. I love doing television, I love selling records, but when I'm at these venues with hundreds of people, and they're all sitting listening to my music and my jokes, I feel like I could die that day, and I would be happy.
- I love my life so much. I wouldn't change anything.
- Mental health and sobriety is not a straight line, and 'Drag Race' is a family, and we support our family members through anything.
- Trixie is like a hyper-feminine child's toy who has it all. I love looking like I'm from Toys 'R Us but serving off-color comedy.
- I plan to publicize my breakups and profit from them like other celebrities.
- Something that I love about drag is that it's a celebration of feminity.
- I was the poorest kid in my school, poorest kid in my town, poorest family. That stayed with me forever.
- Me myself, Brian, I'm a Midwesterner at heart, and I have this deep, bone-dry sense of humor, and I've found it worked to combine this Barbie with a dry, sarcastic man.
- RuPaul might not broadcast herself as political, but I think she tries to make moves in American history by catching more flies with honey than vinegar. Rather than telling people to vote, maybe she'll do a mini-challenge on voting. She understands that you can influence people in a good way without preaching.
- I don't really like club music or hip hop or electronic music at all. I'm like an old person.
- I don't dress up as a woman: I dress up as a caricature of a caricature of a woman.
- Bad things can happen to you, but it doesn't mean you have to have regrets. It's all about what you do with it.
- I guess drag queens, by nature, have to do everything. When you start being a drag queen, you're grabbing the microphone, hosting the shows. Then, you're setting the microphone down and doing the number. You're spending the day before doing your wigs and sewing your costumes. You're doing everything.
- With Trixie specifically, on the one hand, it's a celebration of femininity. It's that moment when you're playing Pretty Pretty Princess, and there's also, this is what society says a girl looks like, the amount of makeup I wear and the humongous blond wigs.
- I love that drag is a way for people to vacation in the gay nightlife, but... it's quite a different experience to perform for a gay audience than a straight audience.
- June Carter Cash is probably my all-time favorite member of the Carter Family.
- I think the perception of audiences that love folk and country is they're perceived to be more closed-minded than they really are.
- Whatever is underneath all the drag, it actually doesn't really matter. It kind of just matters, are you a great entertainer? And are you nice to work with? Are you good at your job?
- Trixie Mattel has always opened doors for me. It's closed very few.
- I'm not a competitor by nature, and I'm certainly not used to being evaluated.
- I grew up playing guitar in the late Nineties, early 2000s, so a very acoustic-driven pop-rock era, and then in college, I started listening to Jason Isbell and Kacey Musgraves. Then I really fell in love when I discovered really old country, like June Carter Cash - one of my all-time favorites.
- I'm strange! I have a weird sense of humor! I look crazy!
- Most drag queens, they put on music like it's a costume. It's not in their bones. It's not in their background.
- I look like Forrest Gump.
- I'm very business-minded. I think that's something that sets me aside from other drag queens.
- Out of drag, I'm a white guy with a guitar, which isn't special. There are a million white guys with guitars. But being a drag queen with a guitar is a lot more commanding.
- I'm always myself. Always. The only difference is that I come off as mean out of drag.
- Drag queens always base their personas on their favorite female icons. Mine was Barbie, who's not necessarily a human but is as iconic and beautiful as any woman. I started really pushing it because I hit a crossroads of, 'I don't want to look like a woman or a man. I want to look like a wind-up toy, a plaything manufactured in a factory.'
