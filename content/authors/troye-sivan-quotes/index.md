- I spent so long and so much of my childhood holding myself back for fear of what people would think. I'm trying my best every day to throw that away.
- The most radical thing that I can do is share how happy I am.
- All my friends were doing just dumb stuff that kids do, like making out with people at parties and starting to date... I didn't know any gay people growing up or any queer people growing up, and so I just really felt alone and kind of lost, and I just wasn't experiencing life.
- I'm lucky enough to exist in 2018, where I have a record label that's like, 'Write whatever you want to write.' I don't have to hide anything.
- I'm so ludicrously lucky, it would be disgusting if I didn't acknowledge it.
- I super strongly identify with marginalized communities. I'm not at all religious, but I feel super, super Jewish. I can't even describe the feeling, but it actually feels really similar to being gay, the kind of kinship that you feel with the LGBTQ people. That same sense of community is there with Judaism.
- I know who I am, and I know what my ambitions are. If one kid sees me on TV or sees me in a movie and relates, then I'm done. That's perfectly fine. That's enough for me.
- Before I came out, the thought of someone calling me gay, even when I knew very well that I was, was petrifying.
- Ever since I was a little kid, I got bored, so I learned to sing, and I started singing lessons. And then anytime I was bored, I would start writing and start messing around on my computer, making beats. Then I got bored and started making YouTube videos; that changed my life in a big way.
- I've definitely always had a passion for entertaining.
- I think that the beauty of 'Spud' is that everyone can connect to the character of Spud in so many ways. It's about real experiences that happen to kids all the time.
- I feel like I'm the most creative when I'm bored.
- I share every aspect of my life with the Internet. Whether or not that's a good thing, I don't know.
- Right after something happens to me, the first thing I'll do is go write when those feelings are really, really fresh. I'll hum a tune into my phone sometimes.
- Someone actually asked me once if I used coming out as a publicity stunt. It's cool that we live in a time when being gay could be seen as helping your career.
- I'm most proud of my work in the LGBTQ space. Feels like, above all else, that's something I want to do for the rest of my life.
- In front of a big group of people, in front of cameras, to be in my body and be in that moment, I feel the way that I've always wanted to feel - like a real pop star who is not holding anything back.
- Before coming out, I remember distinctly feeling like there was a delay on my life.
- Whatever success I have found has been a collaborative effort of people helping out and opening their minds and being accepting and celebrating who I am.
- I feel like part of getting better at writing is knowing where to find that inspiration. Right after something happens to me, the first thing I'll do is go write when those feelings are really, really fresh.
- I watched pretty much every coming out video on YouTube that has ever been posted; I watched it in between 14 and a half and 15. Those coming out videos, and those people on YouTube, those brave, brave, brave people on YouTube, without them, I don't know where I'd be.
- I have a majority girl audience on YouTube.
- I wanted to write a song about war and that classic 'We want you' recruitment style from the point of view of the recruiter.
- I write really visually. In my head, I'm constantly picturing things as I'm writing, so for me, videos are such an expressive part of my job.
- When I was born, I always knew something was a little bit different about me.
- I think pop music is in such an exciting place right now, and I do kind of credit that to Lorde with 'Royals.' I think that song changed everything in the pop scene. All of the sudden, alternative pop music became pop music.
- I don't know what I would have done had I not found the Internet. I found a community of people who I really liked and who I felt got me.
- The things that excite me are staying home and cooking.
- To me, writing is a personal thing; I write super-personal, autobiographically.
- People think I must have pushy parents, but that's not the case.
- It's really empowering when, as an artist, you can visualize something and then have the final product turn out the way you wanted it to.
- I always felt different in a lot of ways and didn't really know how to express that.
- I'm on the path to being someone I'm equally terrified by and obsessed with. My true self.
- I love retouching images on Photoshop.
- I feel like I have just been really, really lucky to meet some of the most successful and great actors alive today.
- A lot of being a good voice is knowing when I have a place to speak and when it's appropriate. And to speak from the heart when I do.
- I want to have kids and a hot husband.
- When I was younger, out in public, I never wanted to pop my hip and definitely made sure that my wrist was nice and firm. All these silly, prohibitive things.
