- Thankfully, I found a doctor at Presbyterian Hospital in New York, Scott Hammer, who diagnosed my chronic fatigue as the Epstein-Barr virus, and the medication I took either helped jump-start my immune system or made the virus dormant. I was very lucky.
- I dedicated most of my life to basketball, and that was my plan until my junior year of college when I got ill and was bed-ridden for eight months.

- I get the same rush being on stage DJing that I did on the court.
- My hair - that's, like, really my statement piece.
- If it feels good, feels different, and falls in the middle of both of our wildly different tastes, then we know it's a Sofi Tukker song.
- I learned that being sort of legitimately recognized by a legitimate and traditional recording academy, it made people look at us a bit differently. Not everyone, but some people.
- I grew up drumming but had to put it on the back burner because of basketball.
- Every few weeks, I'd really be worn down. The doctor said just take time off, but it became apparent that the exercise you need to be a top-level athlete brought the symptoms on.
