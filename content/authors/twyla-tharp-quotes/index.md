- I often say that in making dances I can make a world where I think things are done morally, done democratically, done honestly.

- I think people want very much to simplify their lives enough so that they can control the things that make it possible to sleep at night.
- 'Bum's Rush' is a piece about timing, and everything that's in the piece needs to be with the piece. If people are missing, or marking, or unable to use their voices, the impulses that prompt the action are lost, and its logic crumbles.
- Who a dancer is physically feeds into character for me. Always has.

His book is called 'In Search of Lost Time,' and he does it through the senses. He does it through smell. He does it through feeling. He does it through texture. It is all physically driven, that language.

- The artist doesn't really think about consequences - he or she does the work, stands back and looks at and thinks, 'Hmm, that could have worked better like this.' But as a person who needs to sell tickets to do the next work, one needs to analyze how it does or does not hit its mark.
- I find that dancers are only well trained in ballet these days.
- Let me put it this way: I would like to direct a successful film. An unsuccessful film I would not like to direct. Films are very difficult.

- My dancers expect me to deliver because my choreography represents their livelihood.

- What we want from modern dance is courage and audacity.

- The only thing I fear more than change is no change. The business of being static makes me nuts.
- I'm not one who divides music, dance or art into various categories. Either something works, or it doesn't.

- I don't think that scheduling is uncreative. I think that structure is required for creativity.
- A commission is an invitation to fall in love.
- This is the strange thing: Dancers don't age.

- You either entertain an audience or you don't.

- I'm not interested in seeing dance die. It's not to my advantage. Nor is it to our culture's advantage or anybody else's.
- I learned very early that an audience would relax and look at things differently if they felt they could laugh with you from time to time. There's an energy that comes through the release of tension that is laughter.
- I look for dancers who have all the technique in the world. But they must be dancers who are open-minded, who are willing to forget that they know anything. They also have to be gorgeous; they must have a clear image of themselves and strong personalities.
- I am fairly concise when I work and I work quickly because I think work is done better in a high gear than done our in a gear when everyone's exhausted. Get focused, do it!
- I started formal piano training when I was 4. From there I had little violas, and I had dancing lessons of every sort and description, and painting lessons. I had German. And shorthand.
- I always find that the best collaborations are when you work with people that know what they're doing, and you leave them alone to do it.
- Work is work; wherever I'm working, I do the best I can. If the actual dollars come from investors as opposed to taxpayers and patrons, what's the difference?
- It's very important to work myself physically as hard as I can.
- I used to say to myself, 'Well, in the old days everybody danced because they loved to dance, and there was none of this professional garbage going on about how much can you get for this or that or the other, or any of the kinds of things that insecurity can sometimes promote. Sometimes it's for the wrong reasons.'
- I have a sort of tactility about music. I go into record stores and just run my fingers over it, the spines.
