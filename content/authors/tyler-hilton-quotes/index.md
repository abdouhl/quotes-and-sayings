- Kids think books are cool, especially when they see that people they think books are cool are reading.
- Most entertainment careers aren't going to end in fame.
- The acting thing is the side benefit of becoming a little bit well known with my music.
- I was in high school and I had an independent album out, and we kept sending that out, and I was doing shows. No one really dug it. It was very Americana and had a lot of folk elements in it.
- Just true to form with life sometimes - what you're trying to do doesn't necessarily work out, but what ends up happening can be a lot better. I just relax and say whatever is going to happen - happens.
- When I got signed, I wanted to be involved in a charity, but it was hard because I didn't know which problems to start with.
- I have come to terms with the fact that it's called pop music - that's what I play, and that is what I write. I think it is a pretty broad category.
- My favorite part of touring is when I see girls that I've been talking to on my site and then meeting them in person. I can't believe how well the fans get along together. Everyone just seems to be really cool.
- I was a good student. My mom is a teacher, and her side of the family is all teachers. She put a big emphasis on getting good grades.
- In general, I'm pretty shy and nervous about a lot of things. For me to get on stage for the first time took so many times at an open mic before I finally got on stage and did it.
- The reason I like doing these acting projects is because no matter how much acting I do, I'll always have music in my life. I love having both.
- I base my roots and history in old blues, old country and old bluegrass, and I like rock 'n' roll, and somehow it all came together, and that is what I am playing now.
- 'The Storms We Share' has been a project that I've been working on for so long.
- I didn't see myself doing TV. It's time-consuming.
- My family was all musicians. We jam all the time.
- I like to read really good books - anything that's really great, whether it's fiction, non-fiction, how-to, or whatever.
- Music is what I do naturally.
- I love North Carolina.
- Getting on stage, for me, was a huge thing when I first started. And back in high school, everyone was in rock bands and I was a singer/songwriter. It just seems kind of lame.
- I grew up doing theater and music, and in fact, I spent more time doing theater, and I'd do music when I could.
- Whether or not I would be able to be an actor without the music I'm not sure, but I feel pretty lucky to do it.
