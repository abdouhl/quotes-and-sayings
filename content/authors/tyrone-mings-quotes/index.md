- There have been times in my football career where I've thought: 'Is this it? Is this as far as I'm going to go?'
- As much as you want to improve or help the team, as a centre-back your job is to go under the radar and keep the ball out of the net. If you do that and let the strikers get all the adulation and the headlines, then you're probably doing your job.
- John Terry has developed my game for sure.
- If you make one thing your life and soul - as much as football is my career and main focus - then it turns into a very mentally unstable place to be.
- So being unable to play for so long isn't where you want to be as a footballer. And if you are not playing for long periods of time, your career is only going to go one way.
- I've got two discs at the bottom of the back that are quite badly damaged, that obviously happened over a period of time, and there's inflammation on one of the vertebrae as well, which has come from the angle of my pelvis and spine.
- If we have poor coaches, that's a reflection of me and a reflection of what we think we can give to the kids.
- Coming out of a club and going into a new one is never easy.
- When it got to the diagnosis of my knee and when I realised how long I was going to be out, my thoughts spiralled out of control.
- I have never pulled a muscle and I don't see myself as a person who needs to try and stay fit. I just need to play games and you can never replicate that in training.
- I struggle to see myself as Tyrone Mings the Ipswich footballer. I'm just Tyrone from Chippenham.
- But I don't see myself as someone who needs to be managed or has to worry about injuries.
- I was in an academy from the age of eight. I couldn't play for my grassroots team then.
- Since I have been called up I think I have heard from everyone I have ever come into contact with in football, which is nice. Everyone has played their own part in my development and has a story to tell on my journey.
- I buy sleeping bags, food, gloves and warmers, and I just usually go out in Bath, which is where I'm from, and hand them out. I've done it on Christmas Eve, schedule allowing.
- In moments of difficulty there are positives you can take and lessons you can learn.
- Whenever you're playing in the Championship or League football, you know there are play-offs at the end of it. If you miss out on the top two, it's a great alternative to play in a play-off final.
- I couldn't see playing for England at all. I had other goals at the time when I was a mortgage advisor and had different goals when I was playing non-league football.
- John Terry is a fantastic centre-back - a centre-back that a lot of people would put in their all-time Premier League XI.
- I just want to enjoy my football and hopefully that brings success to the team.
- I think if you're not conceding so many goals, it gives you a great platform to win games.
- I think I missed out on so many good experiences - maybe priceless experiences - playing with my friends when I was growing up.
- I can't say that while I sat at my desk cold calling or trying to help people re-mortgage that playing for England was a real achievable goal.
- Me and my girlfriend don't have any family in Ipswich, so we were thinking of what we could do to fill our time on Christmas Day. We thought about feeding the homeless and we phoned up the church that we eventually went to and asked if we could help.
- I lived in a homeless shelter. That's what I mean when I say I've been in situations where people need help. I don't remember my exact age, but I remember there were two bunk beds and five of us in there: me, my three sisters and my mum.
- I've been in a lot of unfavourable situations growing up, so I know what it's like to need help.
- If you are in any position of influence, then it's almost your duty to try to help. If people don't have the ability or opportunity to help themselves, then sometimes it's got to come from someone who can.
- I do speak to a few people in non-league. There are a few people in Bristol where my family is based that I used to play with at Yate.
- Kids will never go under the radar any more because there are so many scouts at grassroots level. Also, if you come out of a professional academy, it's a very lonely place for a child and some kids don't bounce back from it.
