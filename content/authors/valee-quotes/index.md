- I'm real easygoing.
- I rarely like the music I make. It's like nothing's good enough. I just stay in my head, waiting on the next best beat, so I can do something better than what I did.
- Basically, coming up, listening to Cash Money and Master P, and my mother would listen to Sade and Erykah Badu, things like that. I didn't like that music back then, but now, I guess, to look for soothing music or tones, you know, I would look to that, and I would love to do something with Sade or Erykah Badu.
- I had very bad temper tantrums. I was in more grammar schools than there are years of grammar school. I got kicked out of, like, two preschools, a kindergarten.
- People say it's a quiet flow, that it sounds like I'm in a library. That could have come from when I was living in my old place, a nice loft. I was the youngest person in the building, and I would be working alone on my music. I would get emails two or three times a month about 'loud' music, so I became quieter and quieter about making beats.

- My last name is Taylor. So in school, every time we got a project, I'm at the end. So I get to see the whole class do their project. Then, when it comes time to do mine, of course I'd pass, and the teacher wouldn't have too many questions.
- I like to work smart and make music that people want to hear - just finding ways to not get on people's nerves when I'm coming through their ears.
- There were a few labels scouting me, but I felt like G.O.O.D. had my best interest at heart. They gave me the freedom to really do what I want, which is to expand my brand, make great music, and find ways to elevate my sound.
- A lot people don't know that Mannie Fresh is one of my favorite producers because I used to just be fascinated with how he would be producing stuff. He'd be silly, too, when he raps.
- I was always into different stuff: custom cars, electrical, construction, tattooing, decor, you name it.
- If I play somebody's mixtape, if it gets on my nerves halfway through because it's too loud or everything sounds the same, it makes me want to approach every song I do differently. I don't want somebody saying, 'That's enough of this,' when they listen to my music.
- I'd love to be a NASCAR driver because they're, like, in their forties and fifties.
- I'm an old man. A big weekend for me is Home Depot and a Caesar salad.
- I do my own tattoos.
- I want to work very hard on music, put out a lot of nice product - good quality product - and then just help people out, like a Gucci Mane, like a Future... like a Prince, like a Michael Jackson.
