- I'm black and white, so either, sometimes, you're not considered by the breakdown of the script: you're not 'black enough' for this role. Or you're not 'white enough' for this role. Or, like, looking up to people, who do I identify with? And not seeing Barbies that maybe look like me.
- I've been doing this journey in acting and singing since I was six years old, and I definitely think this will take me to the next level - in movies.
- I've adjusted to being mostly situated in Vancouver now, which I love, and to the fandom that comes along with it. At some points when we're filming in Vancouver, there are more than 100 fans outside our scene. It's so cool being able to be a part of something where people are so passionate.
- I would love to do some type of action feature. That's my goal. A really cool, Transformers-type feature would be awesome.
- Growing up biracial, I didn't have someone to look up to watching TV or movies. Halle Berry was the closest one who looked like me. I'm happy to see more biracial people on screen, and I'm happy to represent for the little girls who didn't have someone who looked like me on TV.
- A lot of people judge bisexuality as 'being promiscuous' or something like that. But I believe you can love somebody; you can fall in love with a person's soul.
- I always know when my agents have good news for me because they conference call me.
- I definitely think awards ceremonies should have gender-neutral categories.
- I was in a music class when I was little, and they discovered I had a talent and could sing. From there, I joined this singing troupe in California, and I would just go sing at festivals in this girl group and perform as much as I could.
- Like, literally, when you get the script, you're like, 'Whoa, I hope the Black Hood isn't after me.' I guess we'll find out.
- I am starting to feel more comfortable as a woman in the entertainment industry because of the #MeToo movement, so I feel so proud of all the women that came forward and who are fighting for us.
- My mom helped me get started when I was younger. I started with singing. An agent saw me singing on stage at the Palm Springs Festival, and recommended I get into acting, so I was like, 'Oh, okay.' I just started from there, singing and acting.
- I think it's important to show every type of love on a show.
- I had to stay off Twitter for a little bit, and I had to not read the comments or look at my at mentions because I was getting a lot of nasty comments. At the end of the day, it does get to you, and it does make me sad.
- My character is Toni Topaz, and she's from the new-generation Archie Comics. I will be rocking the signature pink hair.
- I booked my first series when I was 13. Acting kind of took control because I was just going from part to part at that point.
- I'm working on my music - I've taken a little break from it and want to get back into that.
- When people see 'bisexual,' they still confuse it with promiscuity, which is so wrong. So I was so pumped to be the first bisexual on Riverdale and just normalize that for viewers.
- I definitely understand what it's like not having family around when you want them there, but you don't live in the same city.
