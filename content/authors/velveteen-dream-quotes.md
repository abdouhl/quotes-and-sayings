- It's hard for me to label myself or characterize myself.
- Evolve is an amazing promotion.
- Wrestling gave me something outside science, which was my muse before this.
- The Dream couldn't tell you the vibe in the NXT locker room, because, quite frankly, I have my own. When you are a Superstar as high up on the totem pole as The Velveteen Dream, you have those luxuries.
- The Dream didn't need to struggle. He's homegrown talent, straight from the WWE Performance Center, trained by the best coaches in the world: Norman Smiley, who's known from coast-to-coast, Matt Bloom, head trainer, and I am protege of the one-and-only The Heartbreak Kid Shawn Michaels.
- Funny, I think that the only reason I'm compared to Prince is because of my skin color.
- I'm just like anyone else: I need love and water. I don't really consider myself a 'Superstar.'
- Prince played a big influence on my style.
- I don't live in a prism, and I'm not afraid of anything. I haven't built any walls around myself.
- I don't like the word 'fan.' Fan is short for 'fanatic.' Everyone that follows The Dream is a supporter, more or less.
- Supporters - they're where the heart is. They don't need 'merch.' They don't need to show their affection by wearing a sandwich board on their bodies, logos. No, no, no... people who support The Dream are a little bit more sophisticated than that.
- I can say the people you see on TV are real-life individuals, not just people playing a role, myself included.
- I'm a very introspective individual.
- I don't believe in time.
- If The Dream is worried about other people's matches, how can he be a man of his word?
