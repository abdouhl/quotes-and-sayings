- I was raised doing martial arts.
- Everything we do, even the slightest thing we do, can have a ripple effect and repercussions that emanate. If you throw a pebble into the water on one side of the ocean, it can create a tidal wave on the other side.
- I do a lot of mixed martial arts - it's like unlimited fighting. I do Brazilian jujutsu, beach volleyball. I don't like my routine to get stale, so I also lift kettle bells and push cars.
- I think I'd just like to get in a time machine and travel and never come back. The '20s would be an incredible place to be, dressing up in tuxedos with fancy cars. That sounds incredible.
- I believe sci-fi fans are incredibly intelligent.
- Television is generally on the conservative side, so if you're seeing it represented on TV, that probably means it's really out there in the real world.
- I don't want to miss out on the chance of having a good time.
- If you're not challenged, you'll get bored.
