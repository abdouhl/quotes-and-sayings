- People I respect complimenting me on my work in fashion is more exciting to me than anything I ever achieved as a Spice Girl. I am now competing in an arena where I can hold my head high.

- Myself and David, we both love art. We have a lot of respect for Damien Hirst and Julian Schnabel, and we've met them both, and they're very interesting characters.

- If I'm going to do something, I'm going to do it 110%, or there's no point in doing it at all, especially if the work takes me away from time with my husband and children.
- I want to evolve each season. I never want to be one of those brands where people know what they're going to see. I always want an element of surprise. One thing I never want to do is copy what anybody else is doing. I have a signature, and it's very important to me to stay true to that.
- Antonio Berardi is one of my good friends.

- I don't like laziness or cutting corners.
- I looooove Miss Piggy.

- I've been that celebrity on the red carpet, and I appreciate that something hasn't got to just look good from the front, from the back, it's got to look good at all angles.
- I've never been a six-foot-tall, skinny model, so therefore, I want to create an illusion. People always think I'm taller than I am - not just because of the shoes I wear but because of the way I dress. It's all relatively streamlined.

- I'm still me even after all that's happened.
- I think the sexiest thing about a woman is confidence, but confidence in a humble way, not in an arrogant way. Sense of humor is definitely important. And sunglasses always hide a multitude of sins. Sunglasses and a great pair of heels can turn most outfits around.

- I love fashion - I really feel it's where I belong.
- After dinner I'll catch up with emails. And when I'm lying in bed, I think about the next collection. That makes me sound insane, doesn't it? That I'm getting into bed with David Beckham and thinking about clothes?

- I'm a very driven, ambitious, positive person. But I'm a spiritual person as well.

- I never try to follow a trend or fashion.
- I'll admit it: I'm a control freak. I am. If I'm going to do something, I'm going to do it 110% or there's no point in doing it at all, especially if the work takes me away from time with my husband and children.

- I'm not materialistic. I believe in presents from the heart, like a drawing that a child does.
- These people are amazing. It's so emotional I was thinking about wearing waterproof mascara.
- There are two types of women out there: there's the kind of woman who finds something nice and likes to keep it to herself, and then there's the other type, which is me, who wants to share.
- I think as I have got older, I have got a bit more relaxed, although you might not think that if you heard me screaming at my kids.
- I'm a very, very healthy eater. I eat lots of fish, lots of vegetables, lots of fruit. I don't eat junk food.
- I like to make the best of what I have. I'm not a supermodel, clearly. I'm not a makeup artist. I'm a real woman.
- I have no time for it at all, when women just don't like women. I don't get it.
- I was never going to give Mariah Carey any competition.
- I was an okay singer. I was an okay dancer. But acting? Never could do it.
- I wake up every morning and I feel like I'm juggling glass balls. I live in Los Angeles, my business is run out of London, and most evenings I'm cuddled up in front of Skype, in my dressing gown, speaking with my studio in London. I travel a lot, my team travel a lot, but I wouldn't have it any other way.
- My glasses say a lot about me because I think me in a pair of sunglasses is an image that a lot of people would recognise.

- I don't have any issues with my age.
- I've got great people who handle my schedule, and everything does revolve around the children. If there's a parents' night or an Easter bonnet parade or a Nativity play, whatever it might be, then I plan everything around that.
- We are still so close, David and I. We were at a party the other day at my mum's house and I was sitting on his lap. We're very affectionate. And I looked at him and thought after being married for 11 years! We were the only couple who were even near each other at that party. We're soul mates.
- I'm lucky that I do something I love, and I am proud, as I think it's a positive message to give to young women: if you want to have a career and be married with children, then you can. It's full-on, but it's doable.
