- Your film really needs to call audiences to theatres.

- What excited me to do 'Thugs of Hindostan' was to make a film in the large format about a character, who is not inherently noble.
- I think Malta is great for a song. It's got very nice and narrow roads with beaches. So if you personally ask me, I would shoot action there. It can be very exciting since there's water all around and there can be boat chases. Even travel films like 'Before Sunset' can be shot there.
