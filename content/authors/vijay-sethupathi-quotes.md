- I don't choose my directors, but I choose my scripts wisely.
- During script narrations, if I feel the screenplay mood jumping abruptly, I tell the director, and they work on it.
- I came to cinema for money. I had to settle a loan of Rs 10 lakh. I had no other go, so I thought I'd try my luck in films. I was earning Rs 25,000 at that time. It was not even enough for my family.
- In feature films, I used to be the hero's friend, a regular character. In short films, I played the hero; I got roles where I could work on my character and performance. They made me aware of myself as an actor.

- I don't differentiate a film as off-beat or commercial, because I just don't understand the difference. 'Naanum Rowdy Thaan,' for example, wasn't written for me. It came to me by chance after two or three other heroes turned it down. I agreed to do the role, as I liked the script immensely.
- I don't believe a role can be written keeping in mind some actor. Even if such roles exist, I don't pick them because I generally choose roles that I think will suit my image.

- When I did 'Naanum Rowdy Thaan' with Nayanthara, she was in the peak of her career - I was apprehensive about her willingness to act with me.

- I can not stay at the place when a stranger starts talking to me. I will try to cut the speech as quick as possible and move away. I had to break this inhibition before becoming an actor.
- I have to consider the amount of business that my name can do and choose my projects carefully.
- I am always for and with the Tamil people.
- I don't want to do films for the fun of it.
- When 'Pizza' released, I was a nobody. Initially, we managed to get only 100 screens. But, after its success, the producers of 'Naduvula Konjam Pakkatha Kaanom' got 150 screens and also released the film in the U.S. Now, distributors are keen to invest in my films because they feel I have face value.
- We are actors. We can adapt to any different look for the sake of the story and the character.
- If I spend 10 days at home, I'll be dying to get back to the set. I love the thrill of a good dialogue, the buzz of shooting.
- I don't take any project lightly. Every project is important for me. In fact, every scene in every film is important.
- The energy of first-time directors is tremendous. They work beyond the limits for a hit in this competitive industry.
- I'll give the director what he wants, but please explain the requirement. If it reaches me, then there's communication.

- As an actor, you need to use everything at your disposal.
- Directors are the fulcrum of the movie. They guide us well, not merely rein actors in. Whenever we stray, they bring us back on track.
- If you don't see me act, my work is done. The actor must never take the character beyond the scope of the movie.

- If you start worrying about risks, you might as well stay inside the womb.
- I've never consciously done 'safe' commercial projects; luckily, they have done well.

- It is not that I don't want to sign films, but I don't want to accept any film coming my way.
- One of my biggest drawbacks is my inability to maintain my physique. I put on weight for 'Soodhu Kavvum' and never managed to shed it. Luckily, that look suited a few films, including 'Orange Mittai.'
- I am not bothered about my career graph, as I am someone who doesn't believe in planning things.
- Planning bores me. I like to go with the flow. Being whimsical is nice, occasionally. It keeps things fresh; there's no expectation.

- I used to be very photogenic. My brother took a lot of pictures of me in Dubai. I thought maybe I could be a movie star. There was a hurdle, though - I didn't know anything about films.
- I'm self-taught. Even today, on the sets, I probe the lightmen, the stunt artistes... they are from a period I've not seen; I can visualise it through them.

- Caste has divided us. I wish it should be completely abolished from our society.
- Roles should choose an actor and not vice versa.
- Director Jai Krishna is an optimist who has a never-say-die attitude. He has impressed me thoroughly with his faith in the industry. Not many are aware of the fact that this man had to wait for almost 30 years in this industry to direct 'Vanmam,' his first film.
- I was active on Facebook for a while, responding to comments and thanking fans for their appreciation. But I found that the Facebook feed was numbing my emotions. I'd see an extraordinarily tragic news item, and even before I could react to it, see a hilarious meme right below it. This was confusing me.
- Politicians are dividing us based on caste lines.
- I used to hang out with a group of aspiring directors before 'Pizza' happened. We used to discuss a lot of stories all the time.
- The day I became a hero, my dream was realised. Everything else is a bonus.
- I have both joyful and heartbreaking moments in life, even now. Stardom doesn't give us everything.
- There is no hard and fast rule that I only work with debutants. I give prime importance to script, and when that works out, everything else falls in place automatically. In fact, most debutants express interest to work with me.
- The food we eat is our identity. The youth of the nation must save our food culture and traditions. If not, it will affect future generations.
- When my parents force-fed me healthy food, they were confident they were giving me the best. But now, when I feed my children, I am not sure if what I am giving them is safe. Politics and pesticides are destroying our food culture.

- 'Vikram Vedha' is special because it has taken me to the next level in my career.
- We have to eradicate caste.
- A new character is like bringing a new human being into your life.
- I don't have a role model.
- The story is important for any movie, for it is in the film industry, the consumer pays the money before he or she gets the product. So, the responsibility of delivering a good product is on us.
- I have always felt that doing too much of homework makes the performance look plastic. I don't even watch the monitor after I finish my scene because I can't reprise it. I just go with the flow.
- The very expectation that an actor loves to experiment becomes a shackle that is difficult to snap out of.
- To be honest, many of my well-wishers want me to play the solo lead in films. Maybe, it's time to think about it. In fact, I have cut down on signing up multi-starrer films.
- I was always under the impression that acting is an innate gift. One of the first things I heard them say at Koothu-P-Pattarai was that actors should realise the art of acting through their training.

- All my films have turned out well only because of the director's brilliance, not because of me.
- I want to make my kind of films but make them work commercially, too. When my presentation meets the director's imagination, the result will be great.
- Directing films is easier said than done. The job needs a lot of sensibility to put many things in place.
- I am a bad dancer.
- We never take people seriously when they are alive, but once they are gone, we always think that we should have treated them better.
- If I am ever forced to choose between my identity as a Tamilian and an award from the central government, I will choose the former.
- Most of my friends are assistant directors.
- If a film is suitable for family viewing, it should remain so, and if a film has some adult content, it should remain so, and these genres should never be mixed and spoil the vision of the story teller.
