- I started the trend of doing only one film at a time.
- I like Kamal Haasan's daring choice of roles. When I was in school and college, I modelled myself on him. I was so much in awe of him.
- In 'Dhil,' my character wants to become a cop, and those who want to become cops have a small waist. In 'Saamy,' where I play a cop, my waist is thicker. Because after you become a cop, that's how you look.
- I have an obsession for quality.
- Money is important, but it's not the only driving factor for me.
- I'm an actor who believes in looking different in every film of mine.
- Being a South Indian from Paramakudi, I know I wouldn't be considered for awards many times.
- I am interested in biographical stories. Seldom are good biopics like 'Maha Nati' being made.
- I am a jovial person in real life.
- Sometimes, despite your best efforts, the end result does not match the expectations. '10 Enradhukulla' is still a movie very close to my heart.
- I was riding pillion on my friend's motorbike, and we met with an accident which badly injured my right leg. I was bedridden for three years and used crutches for one year before I fully recovered.
- I don't see coming to Kerala as a commercial exercise; it's a human venture. Every film I make, I come here. I am the prodigal son.
- I enjoy fame, but I like normal, too. Going out is difficult; you are recognised, and you cannot be normal anymore... you start living in a bubble, and I am a normal guy.
- Some of the actors who came to cinema much later than me have tried their hand at direction. But, I don't intend to wield megaphone anytime soon, since it is tough and requires a lot of your time.
- The trouble is that in south cinema, after you become successful at the box office, market realities dictate your choice of films, and it becomes difficult to experiment.
- You will see a different Susi Ganesan in 'Kanthaswamy.'
- Catching a culprit becomes really easy when there are video footages from the crime scene.
- With each of my films, I want to look/be different from the real me and want my performance to be different from the last one.
- In 'Anniyan,' the character I did had three different looks in the film, and I was able to carry it off.
- I informed Malayalam filmmakers that I can do a film for free if the role excites me.
