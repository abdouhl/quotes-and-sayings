- If I categorized home runs that I've seen, without a doubt the monumental one is Henry's... but I've seen a lot of classic, great home runs. Gibson's was probably the most theatrical home run I've ever seen.
- The game is just one long conversation, and I'm anticipating that, and I will say things like 'Did you know that?' or 'You're probably wondering why.' I'm really just conversing rather than just doing play-by-play. I never thought of myself as having a style. I don't use key words. And the best thing I do? I shut up.
- It's a wonderful feeling to be a bridge to the past and to unite generations. The sport of baseball does that, and I am just a part of it.
- It's a great time of the year... if you can stand it.
- I try to call the play as quickly as I possibly can and then shut up and let the crowd roar because, to me, the crowd is the most wonderful thing in the whole world when it's making noise.
- As long as you live keep smiling because it brightens everybody's day.
- I think when I first started, I tried to make believe I was in the ballpark, sitting next to somebody and just talking. And if you go to a ballgame, and you sit there, you're not going to talk pitches for three hours.
- If I can get a story about a player, I would give you a ship load of numbers, batting averages and all just for that one precious story. That's the kind of thing that I love to do.
- Be a bobbed cork: When you are pushed down, bob up.
- I've told several writers this, and, again, I get back to it, but if you want to make God smile, tell him your plans.
- I'm going to sit back, light up, and hope I don't chew the cigarette to pieces.
- Thank you for sneaking your transistor under the pillow as you grew up loving the Tigers. God has a new adventure for me.
- Andre Dawson has a bruised knee and is listed as day-to-day. Aren't we all?
- On radio, you're in your own little world. Every time I'd be doing a possible no-hitter - I think I've done something like 25 no-hitters and a couple of perfect games - I would always put the date on the tape. Not for me, but for the player, so that 25 or 30 years later when he's playing it for his kids or grandkids, you have that date.
- When I was very small, maybe 8 years old, we had a big radio that stood on four legs, and it had a cross piece underneath it, and I used to take a pillow and crawl under the radio.
- In all honesty, once you become a professional, number one, you're no longer a fan. I don't root for the Dodgers, really. I just try to do the game as best I can. And the winning and the losing will take care of itself.
- Don't let the winds blow your dreams away... or steal your faith in God.
- Almost all of us growing up have played baseball on some level. It has an inside track with people. It has a unifying effect.
- It's a wonderful feeling being a bridge to the past and unite generations.
- To be honest, I've never been interested in how many games I've done and seen. It doesn't mean anything to anybody. All I know is I'm eternally grateful for having been allowed to work so many games.
- Statistics are used much like a drunk uses a lamppost: for support, not illumination.
- Good is not good when better is expected.
- I really love baseball. The guys and the game, and I love the challenge of describing things. The only thing I hate - and I know you have to be realistic and pay the bills in this life - is the loneliness on the road.
- One of my favorite expressions ever uttered by a player is Roy Campanella's line about how, in order to be a major-league player, you have to have a lot of little boy in you.
- You can almost taste the pressure now.
- The roar of the crowd has always been the sweetest music. It's intoxicating.
- It's easier to pick off a fast runner than to pick off a lazy runner.
- A man really determines himself by what he does.
- I don't like to be alone, but I do cherish the moments that I'm alone with a good book.
- Losing feels worse than winning feels good.
- That really is my trademark. Day to day, week in, week out. If something happens and the crowd roars, I shut up.
- I guess my thermometer for my baseball fever is still a goose bump.
- I'm not a military general, a business guru, not a philosopher or author. It's only me.
