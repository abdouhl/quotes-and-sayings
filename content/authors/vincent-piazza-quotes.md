- As an actor, I like as much time with the material as possible and given the opportunity, time spent with the other actors in the scene. But that is a rare luxury in working in any TV series.
- I'm a real low profile guy. So a date night for me is kind of curled up at home and watching something... have a nice glass of wine, a nice meal and we're all set.
- I think there's a stigma to some degree about the outer boroughs and Jersey, and whether their stories are worth telling.
- I like to put a little spin on traditional styles as I see them now, probably somewhat inspired by my current job on 'Boardwalk Empire.'
- I fell for MUJI socks at their store in N.Y.C.'s JFK airport, and now I get them in bundles.
- I think New York style is unique because there's something resourceful about it. Utilitarian. Whereas in Los Angeles, I find people make their cars a day closet. Which, I guess, is resourceful in a different way.
- I don't shop as much as I find.
- I've picked up a great appetite for pastrami on rye and nice cream soda. It's fantastic, but I have to be careful, or I'm going to get really fat.
- I really think that the 'Jersey Boys' musical - and this is just my opinion - lends itself to being cinematic in some way, because it's a jukebox musical; the characters break into song only for the scene transitions.
- I find historical figures in general very tricky because you feel at times that you're serving two masters. Not only the arc and wonderful writing that comes with the show, but also the history of a person's life.
- Growing up, I thought wearing a suit was a burden.
- I applied a lot of the same principles I used in hockey into my acting. I might have had some naive ambitions of making the NHL, but thank God, playing hockey gave me a good foundation for everything else.
- A lot of people say, 'I always knew Lucky Luciano as a very smooth, very elegant, very powerful man.' All the accounts of him as an older man were that he was very genteel but he still had the look of smothered violence behind his eyes.
- I feel a great responsibility playing a historical figure because whether they were good or bad, I feel like the person deserves a fair shake. It's like being the executor of their estate in some ways.
- I live in N.Y.C. and walk everywhere, so I like stylish shoes that are comfortable.
- I've picked up a great appetite for pastrami on rye and a nice cream soda. It is fantastic. So I have to be careful or I'm going to just get really fat.
- A custom-tailored suit retains a certain dignity about it.
