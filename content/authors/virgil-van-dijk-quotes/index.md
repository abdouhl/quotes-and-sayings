- We just need to keep improving. Keep doing what we are doing and get better. That's the only way forward.
- I don't really care, if somebody boos me or boos the team, we're trying to win the game.
- You have to, you need to be hard with each other. When things aren't going right you need to tell each other, otherwise it's going to be too easy.
- I won't be a pundit because you have to be saying certain things that you might not even want to, but you have to.
- I try to read the game as well as I can.
- The only thing I want to do is focus and get better.
- Quite a lot of things are more important than playing football and what we do, we are blessed.
- As a defender I try to keep clean sheets.
- The main thing is to try to put in your head that we all start from the bottom.
- Obviously there are a lot of expectations when you come to a club for a record fee but you can't change that. You just need to perform and show it on the pitch and gain respect through that.
- It is a strength of mine to not really bother too much when people have their opinions, especially negative opinions.
- I just enjoying playing for Liverpool, it doesn't really matter who is standing next to me.
- The season is very long.
- Football is a game. It's something I love to do. But there are so many things in life that are more important.
- I think as a central defender you grow as a player.
- You need to be aware of the qualities of every striker you face, as I always am, but sometimes you need to be smart and more than 100% ready for anything.
- I'm very happy to have already been welcomed into the LFC family, I'm a part of history having won the Champions League and hopefully we keep making history.
- We can't always play the perfect game.
- I don't fear anyone.
- Like Koeman, Klopp knows exactly how to get the best out of me - by being critical. When the media are hyping me and being very positive, he will downplay the praise and all that - often with a wink.
- I have always been very critical of myself and I like the people around me to be critical too.
- I need to be coming off the pitch every game with my voice gone, and that's something I can bring. I am just someone who likes to organise, make sure everything is well organised, because that makes it a lot easier for yourself too.
- You take every opportunity you have to win a trophy. That is always the goal, and winning makes it a little bit easier the next time.

- You have pundits and fans from other teams who will say loads of things and it goes past me. That's life.
- There's always pressure at a big club.
- I hate losing, like everyone else.
- When I went to FC Groningen, I had to take my bike to training - my first wage went on driving lessons. Before I signed my contract, I was 15 or 16 and working as a dishwasher in a Breda restaurant.
- The influence of social media is unbelievable. It's sad to see - it's a fake life that some people live.
- I looked death in the eye - and it was a terrible experience.
- Why be negative when you can enjoy life and be positive? That's something I learned over the years.

- I have improved since I joined Liverpool.
- To play with pressure is always a good thing. I like to play with pressure.
- I want to enjoy the games because not a lot of people have the chance to do what we do. That's how we started football as well, enjoying what we are doing and that's what I try to do as well.
- I just want to be remembered as a fantastic player who gave everything for the team and enjoyed every bit of it.
- Fear is not something we feel at Liverpool.
- It's great to get recognition from other players.
- We need to look at what we have ahead of us and that is more important than looking at someone else. It is the only way forward.
- It's always a great feeling to help Holland as well as Liverpool but we all do it together.

- If you're nervous you think: 'I don't want to make mistakes or give the ball away.' But you limit your own qualities then.
- There's always things to improve, you can't be satisfied with what you have.

- Ronaldinho - he was one of my idols.
- I'm a big fan of 'Prison Break' - I've watched it eight times.
- To get the PFA Player of the Year is a fantastic honour. It's the highest honour you can get because it's voted by your fellow peers.
- Scoring goals looks nicer and much more attractive than a last-ditch tackle for younger people.
- I was never a standout player until I played for the under-19s and became the captain. Then everything went much better - I played some games for the under-23s and after that it went pretty quickly.
- You should not have any fear when you go out on the pitch.
- Why make things difficult? Why have tough times when it's not necessary?
- Marco van Basten - I never saw him properly play but I know he was pretty good.
- When you're 2-0 down after 30 minutes, then you know it's going to be tough.

- As players, the only thing we can do is give everything on the pitch, and that's what the fans do for us as well.

- We can do what we love to do and also to play for Liverpool - they are such a big club. You need to enjoy it but the pressure will always be there.
- Winning a trophy is important for your mentality.
- In my position when things are going well it's pretty easy to say that I'm sort of the guy that fixes everything. But if things are going bad then I'm the one that gets all the blame. In the end, we all do it together.
- At Liverpool, we are all part of one unit, not just the 11 on the pitch.
- The world can be very cruel.
- I think at a club like Liverpool you always feel a bit of pressure. You should. But it doesn't bother me.

- There are plenty of good central defenders around and I enjoy watching them.
- Every step of my career was hard work.
- I have a very similar connection with Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool as I had earlier with Ronald Koeman at Southampton.
- I think it is a very important thing in football to keep each other awake and alert.
- To be in the Champions League final is something you need to experience. To win it would obviously be the best experience ever. To be there, the build-up - with the media even, the stadium, travelling, our fans - it's something very special.
- We want to play on the highest level and the Champions League, other than the Premier League for us, is the highest level.
