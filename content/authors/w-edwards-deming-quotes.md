- Learning is not compulsory... neither is survival.
- The emphasis should be on why we do a job.
- People with targets and jobs dependent upon meeting them will probably meet the targets - even if they have to destroy the enterprise to do it.
- Innovation comes from the producer - not from the customer.
- If you do not know how to ask the right question, you discover nothing.
- What should be the aim of management? What is their job? Quality is the responsibility of the top people. Its origin is in the boardroom. They are the ones who decide.
- The prevailing - and foolish - attitude is that a good manager can be a good manager anywhere, with no special knowledge of the production process he's managing. A man with a financial background may know nothing about manufacturing shoes or cars, but he's put in charge anyway.
- The prevailing system of management has crushed fun out of the workplace.
- A bad system will beat a good person every time.
- Customer expectations? Nonsense. No customer ever asked for the electric light, the pneumatic tire, the VCR, or the CD. All customer expectations are only what you and your competitor have led him to expect. He knows nothing else.
- Declining productivity and quality means your unit production costs stay high but you don't have as much to sell. Your workers don't want to be paid less, so to maintain profits, you increase your prices. That's inflation.
- Quality is pride of workmanship.
- It is not necessary to change. Survival is not mandatory.

- In 1945, the world was in a shambles. American companies had no competition. So nobody really thought much about quality. Why should they? The world bought everything America produced. It was a prescription for disaster.
- If you can't describe what you are doing as a process, you don't know what you're doing.
- I am forever learning and changing.
- Export anything to a friendly country except American management.
- People don't like to make mistakes.
- My mother was my biggest role model. She taught me to hate waste. We never wasted anything.
- If you don't understand how to run an efficient operation, new machinery will just give you new problems of operation and maintenance. The sure way to increase productivity is to better administrate man and machine.

- American management thinks that they can just copy from Japan. But they don't know what to copy.
- 'Quality' means what will sell and do a customer some good - at least try to.
