- The thing about Pablo is that he wasn't happy with what he had - just being the sixth richest man in the world. He wanted to be loved. He wanted to be accepted. He wanted to be President of Colombia; he wanted his kids to go to the same school as the Colombian elite. But he wouldn't be accepted by the elite.
- Pablo wanted to be loved and accepted. He wanted to destroy the elite he despised so much, but he also wanted to be the president of Colombia.
- I grew up watching American films, listening to American music, and it's a big contribution to the rest of the world. I mean, American jazz, for me, is the best thing culturally that America has produced.
- 'Narcos' was a very strong experience, not only artistically and politically, but as a human being.
- This left-wing kind of speech, the Robin Hood thing that Pablo had, of course he was a criminal and a mean person, but it wasn't a false. He wasn't false. I don't know what kind of president he would be, maybe a very bad one, but I am sure he would do things for poor people - popular things that wouldn't solve their lives but would help them.
- I believe that modern slavery is the most outrageous assault on the rights of an individual. It is something that touches me deeply because I grew up in rural Brazil and could see first-hand how poverty forced people to work in harsh, exploitative conditions.
- Doing 'Narcos' is a very, very important part of my life. I dedicated so much of my life to it.
- I'm 100 percent convinced that Pablo Escobar was a human being. And he was a very interesting one. For sure, he was a very, very, very mean and awful human being in many senses, but he wasn't an alien. He was a person. He had friends; people laughed at his jokes. And he was a very contradictory person as well.
- One of the most effective tools in Brazil's efforts to eradicate slavery is a register compiled by the government that lists individuals and businesses found using slave labor. Those on the 'dirty list,' as the register is known, are fined and remain on it for a minimum of two years during which they cannot access public funds.
- I was once supposed to play the wind in a commercial - yes, the wind. I didn't get it.
- Forced labor affects the most vulnerable and least protected people, perpetuating a vicious cycle of poverty and dependency. Women, low-skilled migrant workers, children, indigenous peoples, and other groups suffering discrimination on different grounds are disproportionately affected.
- One of the things that I like about 'Narcos' is that not only Pablo but with all the characters - this is not a black and white show. This is not a regular American cop show where two cool cops go to save a country from a bad guy. All the characters are very complex.
- The heroes of 'Narcos' are the Colombian people who fought and decided to do something about the horrible narco-terrorism that took place in their country back in the '80s.
- I try to be a good father, and my kids are the most important thing in my life.
- I think that addiction is a very, very important thing that has to be treated, but has to be treated as a health problem and not as a police problem.
- We'll always be fascinated by people who live above the law.
- I always thought those World War II films with German people speaking English with German accents was weird.
- If you want to see the real Pablo Escobar, go see a documentary.
- After reading and studying and getting in touch with the amount of information that I had while I was researching to play Pablo, it just reinforced the idea that I had that the war on drugs is a big flop.
- One of the things I like best about Netflix is that they make projects like 'Beasts of No Nation.' It's a film about a reality in an African country where kids were being used to be soldiers in a war. And it made so much sense to me as a citizen of the world.
- Colombians are sick of 'Narcos' stories because Colombia is a country that has changed so much. It's a country that's completely different from the country that we see in 'Narcos.' They reconstructed themselves in 25 years, which is amazing.
- The emotions you see when you watch 'Narcos,' they're pretty much my emotions and the way I would react if I were there. It's not something you create; all of us have everything inside ourselves.
