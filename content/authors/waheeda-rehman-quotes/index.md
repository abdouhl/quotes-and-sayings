- When I was young, I too enjoyed the charm of the glitzy world of movies. Life changed for me after marriage. My priority and focus was my family.
- Success and fame... both are temporary. There today, gone tomorrow.
- I couldn't bring myself to call him by his first name, that wasn't my upbringing. So I suggested I call him 'Anandji.' He glared at me and said, 'Do I look like a schoolteacher to you?' The next day when I called him 'Dev Saab' he looked around as though he didn't know whom I was addressing.
- Script is the most important thing and if the script is good, then whatever role you are doing, it's fine.
- When she offered me 'Arshinagar,' Aparna's interpretation of 'Romeo & Juliet,' my first instinct was to say no.
- When I was offered 'Abhijaan,' I didn't know any Bengali. But Satyajit Ray insisted, saying my character spoke a mixture of Bhojpuri, Hindi, Urdu and Bengali. I agreed only because he had faith in me.
- In the 1960s, songs were an integral part of film narration. I have been fortunate to have had some of the best songs of the era picturised on me, some of which gave me an opportunity to use my skills as a dancer too.
- We Indians are musical- and dance-minded people. If a child is born or on a wedding, birthday, we dance. But when a song starts unreasonably, it irritates me.
- I am extremely satisfied and content. I am happy and I think happiness is enough for everything.
- I was lucky to work with some of the finest filmmakers - Guru Dutt, Satyajit Ray, Vijay Anand, Raj Khosla, Asit Sen.
- I've shot many films in Hindi and some in Bangla in Kolkata. It's always a pleasure to be part of the city.
- Guru Dutt was a serious person, yes. He used to be very impatient, not with the artistes, but with the technicians - especially the camera crew.
- After a certain age, when you are married and have kids your priorities change.
- After' Kaagaz Ke Phool' flopped, which flopped miserably in those days, we immediately started work on 'Chaudhvin Ka Chand.'
- It is strange, but directors have always shown more confidence in my abilities than I've in myself.
- Everyone makes films that don't work.
- You cannot have lasting success if you are only looking for short term gains.
- I never stopped myself from doing difficult roles.
- Though films need retakes, I have always hated them because they tend to become mechanical.
- My very first film in Hindi - 'CID' - was with Dev Anand. I was a big fan of his. So you can imagine my excitement and nervousness at doing a film with him. On the very first day on the sets, when I called him 'Dev Saab' he turned around and said 'No no, call me Dev.'
- During those days, we formed working relationships that lasted beyond the workplace. So even after 'Dil Diya Dard Liya,' Shyama and I would meet often.
- I strongly feel, for me to act in any movie, the director of the movie should be known to me. Though this fact should not be important for most artists. But, you can either call me shy or traditional in my thinking - but this is an important aspect for me to sign movies.
- Both Guru Dutt and Kishore Kumar's lives had lots of ups and downs... their lives were heavy and sad.
- Courage is something I learnt from my father.
- Working with stalwarts like Satyajit Ray, Soumitra Chatterjee and Rabi Ghosh is an experience I always cherish.
- I know we're public figures, but I strongly believe my private life should remain private. What ultimately matters and concerns the world is the work we leave behind.
- If you understand a scene well, it is not hard to translate it onscreen.
- I've been through emotional and financial ups and downs. But I enlarge the positive and avoid negative people.
- I'm proud to be part of Guru Duttji's films.
- The heroines for our established heroes are getting younger and younger. So the heroines, who started their careers with these established heroes, are quickly promoted to senior roles.
- Blessed with intelligence, beauty and undeniable talent, Vidya Balan can work wonders if she receives the right script and a sensible director.
- All actors are muses for their directors.
- It's not just about learning the dialogue and facing the camera, you must somewhat live the role and not always be acting it.
- I like Bangalore because the climate is very good.
- The one actress I can look at and say she could be the next Waheeda Rehman is Vidya Balan.
- I was always fond of giving good education to people.
- Nanda and I never discussed work. Our work never came in the way of our friendship. We were both down-to-earth and very Indian. Both of us attempted glamorous roles but soon realised that it's better to play characters that were close to our personalities.
- Awards have lost their charm. The experience of getting an award has completely dissolved. Awards functions start in December and go on till April and are distributed for anything and everything. Categories like Best Jodi, Best Dressed Celebrity are all redundant.
- I feel lucky to have worked with Satyajit Ray.
- Dilip Kumar's a great, great actor.
- I am highly impressed by Kangana's performance and direction in 'Manikarnika.' She looks absolutely fabulous and beautiful. I am really happy and proud of her.
- I am satisfied with my life.
- People come up to me and say that when I did films, that was the golden era, but I don't agree with that.
- Whether its the National Award, the Padma Bhushan, or several others, nothing will make an artiste happier than the appreciation from the man on the street.
- When I entered the film industry, I hadn't dreamt that I would work in so many movies and opposite so many reigning and future heroes.
- I enjoyed working with all my directors. I may have done more films with certain directors, but it doesn't mean I enjoyed working more with them and less with others.
- I make myself comfortable where my family is.
- I found myself playing Rajesh Khanna's mother just nine years after I played his leading lady in 'Khamoshi.'
- For an actor, one doesn't have to be a dancer. But because our Hindi movies have so many song and dance sequences, it is preferred if they are good dancers. It's always advantageous to know dance. But if you don't, it's okay.
- I am grateful to my fans, my directors and my colleagues.
- Nanda and I were very different individuals, quite the study in contrasts. But we were very close friends. Or maybe we were close friends because we were so different.
- While it's great that some actors can do any character with conviction, I'd probably look odd doing anything unreal.
- Once a heroine is beyond a certain age, she has to graduate to mother's roles or quit.
- It was the ill-fated Dil Diya Dard Liya in 1966, where she played my friend. Though the film didn't do well, it is remembered for its powerful theme. Shyama was an entertaining friend during the shooting and we continued our friendship even after the film was over.
- Call it my good luck or my open-minded nature; I never felt that I was overshadowed by my co-stars.
- I was quite adamant that I will not change my name as it was given by my parents.
- I got the role of a lifetime in Rajinder Singh Bedi's 'Phagun' in 1973. I had to play Jaya Bachchan's mother. That did it for me. I was suddenly flooded with mother's roles.
- I have been taking pictures for a long time but not without learning properly. I have learnt it from Himanshuu Sheth.
- I know I was successful, I was liked and loved and respected; so I was happy with that.
- There are so many fabulous heroine-oriented projects happening in Mumbai, whether it's 'Kahaani,' 'Bobby Jasoos,' 'Queen' or 'Mardaani.'
- I experimented with roles in films such as 'Guide,' 'Mujhe Jeene Do' and 'Teesri Kasam.'
- I have always loved taking pictures. When I was young, I would carry a small camera with me on the sets.
- I've remained somewhat active in the public sphere with various things, including the occasional film.
- I never had any hang-ups about playing a secondary role.
- For 'Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam,' Guru Duttji wanted to cast Shashi Kapoor in the role of Bhootnath. However, Guru Duttji wanted bulk dates from Shashiji because he had already built a huge set and had acquired Meena Kumari's dates. Shashiji couldn't spare the required dates even though he was still a newcomer.
- I always enjoy working with Aparna Sen. She is a dedicated and talented actress, writer, director.
- If I'm asked which is my favourite character to play, I'll definitely say Rosy from 'Guide' because I feel she is very real.
- As for Amitabh Bachchan, I worked with him in 'Reshma Aur Shera' where he played a mute character. While shooting I noticed that he expresses a lot through his eyes. Around the same time he did a commentary for 'Bhuvan Shome.' I felt this boy was amazing. He has got both the traits required for being a good actor: voice and expression.
- When 'Chaudhvin Ka Chand' was released, it was a big success and very well appreciated. At that time, colour films had just started to be made, and Guru Dutt decided to take the title song of the film, shoot it in colour and rerelease it with new fanfare.
- Shyama was very good looking and a good human being. She was warm and affectionate.
- I have known Aparna Sen for many years. We worked together in her film '15 Park Avenue' which was in English.
- Initially, I didn't want to watch 'The Dirty Picture.'
- I have had my innings. And in a way I am happy that I came in an era when a lot of attention was paid to different aspects of filmmaking.
- Dev Anand was extremely cooperative towards a newcomer. He never made me feel that he was a big star and I, a newcomer.
- I like Vidya Balan because she chooses some interesting films.
- When it comes to wildlife photography, you need to have luck and patience.
- If you want to do something and make up your mind about it, you do take out the time.
- When 'Sahib Bibi... ' was being cast, I wanted to do Chhoti Bahu's role, but Meena Kumari had been cast. So I didn't think I would be part of the film.
- I always felt I wouldn't be able to carry off what the directors require from me. Luckily, I manage.
- I felt Guru Duttji was miscast in 'Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam;' he looked older than the role. Shashi Kapoor had an innocent face; he would have looked young and vulnerable.
- With age likes and dislikes change.
- I think it's the most important thing, education. Because without education it's difficult to face life.
- There used to be no bound scripts and the dialogues were given to us on the day of the shoot. There were no proper makeup rooms.
- Satyajit Ray made films the way films should be made - from start to finish. So whether you're needed on the set or not, you can spend your whole time thinking about your character.
- When I signed 'Guide,' my colleagues in the industry said that I was doing a big mistake. They even said that this might be my last film because that was the phase when actresses in the industry were portrayed as submissive women. We used to do love stories or family dramas where women were ideal in every role.
- As an actor, you want to do different things. You don't want to do same kind of stuff. I like the characters I play to have a graph.
- Yes, my acting was not stylised. I always underplayed, maybe because I never learnt acting.
- When I am watching my films, I think I could have done this scene better and I tend to criticise myself. I have liked myself in bits and parts.
- In my time, if your performance was good, you would get the award. It would be a nail-biting experience. We would always be curious whether our name would be announced as the winner.
- Cinema is a product of society.
- As an actor there is an urge to act only if something really interesting comes my way.
- It's exciting to work with new directors with new ideas.
- I don't believe in remakes.
- I don't have any complaints. I've had a satisfying career.
- I travel a lot, read a lot, meet my friends, like to cook occasionally.
- Girl friends tend to drift away after marriage due to certain responsibilities but Nanda and I remained close friends even after I got married.
- I have never worn a sleeveless blouse ever in films or in my personal life, so there was no way that I would wear a bikini.
- I love Huma Qureshi. She was amazing in 'Gangs Of Wasseypur.' I also love Richa Chaddha. She played a mother in 'Gangs Of Wasseypur.' And then I saw 'Fukrey' where she played a gangster, and I couldn't believe it was the same girl.
- I think a director has to be a little in love with his leading actress so he will project her as the most beautiful woman in the world.
- Guide' is not just my most iconic film. It is also Dev's most celebrated work. But I almost didn't do 'Guide.'
