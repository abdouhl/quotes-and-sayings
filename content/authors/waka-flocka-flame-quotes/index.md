- I don't project no image. I just act like myself. I write about how I feel, the emotional stage I'm in at the time. So I write from the heart. I never write from my mind. My brain, I mean.
- Waka Flocka is a product, a franchise, a brand, a label... And a good guy!
- My favorite thing about being engaged is your partner knowing what you want. For us, we love going out to eat.
- I don't eat red meat.
- I joined PETA for minks and dogs. I need my beef, my chicken, my seafood.
- My original name was Juaquin, and my cousin couldn't pronounce my name right. So he'd just be saying 'Waka! Waka!' So when I was younger, I used to always laugh, then my man Gucci gave me the rest of the name.
- I got with PETA for a fur campaign, specifically for fur.
- I didn't get into rap to be no lyrical genius. I got into rap to feed my family and help the people in need around me, that's it. A lot of people say, 'Man, Waka Flocka ain't go no lyrics,' so I was like, 'Yeah, you right!'
- I came from nothing really to something; I came from the gutter to making the gutters.
- You wear fur, it's like you trying to be something you not. You get fur, you can spend the same money on like, 30 jackets.
- It's a total big difference between a person that got lyrics and a person that can make hit singles. I'm a person that can make some hit singles. I'm not in no booth trying to be a lyrical genius. I'm preparing to make me some singles, and as I develop as a man, then they'll respect my emcee skills.
- No matter how you're feeling, a little dog gunna love you.
