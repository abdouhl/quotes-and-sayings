- I like to be surprised. The best writing is when it defies me, when it starts going a different way than I had planned.
- I love the most the students with troubled lives.
- The roundness of life's design may be a sign that there is a presence beyond ourselves.
- I wanted to connect a modern story with a myth that I had read.
- I think I write fiction for the opportunity to get beyond the limits of my own life.
