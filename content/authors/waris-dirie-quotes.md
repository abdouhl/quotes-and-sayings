- I can enjoy anywhere, and I can leave it. Life is about moving on.
- I've never been one to stay still. I was born a nomad, and I still am a nomad and always will be.
- I don't know what a supermodel is. If they call me that, I might have to punch them. It's just so vain and so unreal.
- Personal style? I don't really believe in that. Whatever is comfortable.
- I love life. I wish I could live another 500 years, truly. There is so much to do. I don't feel bitter or angry or disappointed. If anything, I am very grateful for where I come from. I have absolutely no regrets.
- I still do find it very difficult in the West to connect to this politeness of smiling, not saying how you're thinking or not saying how you really feel.
- I love the truth. Tell the truth and live the truth, because we've seen enough lies and look what it's doing.
- I belong nowhere and to no one.
- Brooklyn's good. Brooklyn's funky. Brooklyn's happening.
- Fashion is fun, ridiculously fun. But it's base and it's wrong. You're not doing anything good for the world. You're just saying, 'Buy it, buy it, buy it.'
- If you can survive in the desert, you survive anywhere. I know more than anything life in desert. You can tell by looking at the dirt how long ago it rained, how hard it rained, how much water came through. You can by looking at a plant, a tree, from an animal's look. I can read the desert like I read my hand.
- Sometimes I wonder where I am from. I am either way ahead or I come from another world. I don't recognise this world.
- Every day, women move mountains. It is an insult to have an international women's day.
