- Seeing Dre looking all cut up and in shape made me want to get myself together and look right, too.
- If I'm not putting out music, I'mma be producing for everybody. I got an artist named Mike Slice. He's nice, and he's real good. I'm doing a bunch of production for all the artists in the industry because I'm as much as a producer as I am an artist.
- Death Row had a lot of artists. They had Snoop, the Dogg Pound, the Lady of Rage, and there was other artists that was also on the label, so it was a big list and a long wait. I didn't want to wait that long, so I started branching off and doing my own thing.
- Dr. Dre, my oldest brother, he paved the way for me and Snoop to get a chance to get into the studio. I asked him to show me how to work the MPC-60... I was about maybe 17, 18, right around there.
- I had an apartment on Long Beach Blvd and San Vicente in Long Beach, California. That was the apartment I done 'Regulate' in. I had all my equipment set up in the bedroom, a vocal booth in the bathroom and in the closet, and that's where we created it. I had an MPC 60, a Numark mixer, and a Technics 1200, and a ton of records.
- I would provide more opportunities for the kids of urban communities to go to school and learn trades - to get more jobs to take care of their families.
- My thing is, I don't get in nobody's business or nothing like that or try to bash anybody for what they do. I've got cousins who are gay. To me, there's just no difference. We always chill and have family functions the way we always have. It's not a problem.
- A lot of people in my family have high blood pressure. Dre told me I better start hitting the gym... so I took his advice.
- For 'Regulate,' I was at home, and I came up with it. I was listening to Michael McDonald's 'I Keep Forgettin'.' It was a record that I always loved, from being a kid and my parents playing it when they had their company of friends over. It was a record that just stuck in my head, and it just felt good.
- I'd end all of the wars. I'd bring all of the troops home and make sure that they're taken care of for life - for what they did protecting our country.
- It just feels good to know the work I did, people like it and love it - and continue to like and love it. It makes me feel real good that, after 20 years, 'Regulate' is still in heavy rotation all over the United States and all over the world.
- Just to know that someone who's 15 years old is listening to my music and the work that I've done - it's definitely a blessing.
