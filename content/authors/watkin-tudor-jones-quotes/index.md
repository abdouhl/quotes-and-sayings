- America's got amazing presentation, especially New York - the most potent, strongest, concentrated, amazing presentation.
- We'll support anyone who's doing something fresh.
- It's super trippy coming to America because we know everything about it - from music and film. I know what a Southern accent sounds like; I know what a New York accent sounds like.

- Conceptual art, I don't even know what that is.
- We didn't move to L.A. to move to L.A. We moved to make music with Muggs.

- I used to be called Waddy Jones. But I changed my name to Ninja because it's more me.

- I think because people can't understand our style, they think it's a joke. Our music isn't intellectual - we make music for the common man.

- It's super dope when you connect with something personally.
