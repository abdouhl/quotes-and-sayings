- I was taking electives, and that branched into theater. Theater led to me taking a break during the summer between my junior and senior year. After I graduated, I ended up moving out to L.A. But in my senior year, I made it a part of my major.
- When I got back from shooting 'Deception,' I was under contract with NBC, so I can't really do anything.
- Shonda Rhimes is at the top of television.
- Love the show 'Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives.' Being from Louisiana and a big outdoorsman, I'm a big fan of 'Duck Dynasty' as well.
