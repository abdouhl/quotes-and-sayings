- We never realized how much money there was to be found in character products.
- I was attracted to Joe right away. He was and is one of the greatest cartoon artists I've ever met. I was able to do the timing, and Joe with his draftsmanship could make the storyboards. There were things I could do that he couldn't and vice versa.
- I saw one of the old 'Tom and Jerry' cartoons the other day. I hadn't seen it for 30 years and I didn't remember it. We made 160 of them! I thought it was a very funny cartoon.
- Initially, it was sort of devastating to lose full animation and go limited.
- We almost decided on a dog and a fox before we hit on the idea of using a cat and mouse.
- In my opinion, animation will continue to thrive as long as there are children, parents, television, movies and the need to laugh.
- We wanted a world that looked like our world. In the original 'Flintstones,' low flat buildings filled the city and suburbs. Now, high-rise buildings and apartments exist next to the family neighborhoods. Part of the 'Flintstone' fun remains its parallel of our world.
- I think anything created today can be said to be a ripoff. It's hard to find anything original any more.
- We are trying to build a family image of wholesome movie entertainment.
- We used to make a 'Tom and Jerry' short every six weeks and they were about six minutes long, so we were producing about a minute of animation a week.
- You can compare Fred and Barney Rubble with Gleason and Carney.
- Disney did well with human characters but only in dramas, not comedy.
- Italian work is excellent but it takes them six months to do what we do in a week.
- The concept of the characters in animal skins and us satirizing modern technology made it fun. But the voices we cast and the characterization of Fred Flintstone had a lot to do with it.
- The novelty business is astounding. We can't keep up with it.
- I was never a good artist.
- 'The Flintstones' was the first animated series to appear on nighttime TV.
- I think we had made 160 'Tom and Jerry' cartoons.
- You know, it is a funny thing, but 'The Flintstones' was bought by ABC and the sponsors when they discovered adults were watching and enjoying 'Huck Hound' and 'Quick Draw McGraw.'
- Today's youngster has a more highly developed mind, and if you start to play down to them, you lose them.
- We became very good in developing comical sight gags when we made 'The Flintstones.'
- I used to watch 'The Honeymooners' and laughed so much I'd fog up the inside of the lenses of my glasses.
- I think that - whether I should admit this or not - Joe and I, going back to 'Tom and Jerry,' have been very lucky in being able to do cartoons that have universal appeal.
- 'Tom and Jerry' seemed to be as well liked by adults as by children. 'The Flintstones,' of course, was geared more to adults, but I guess we were just lucky that the kids seemed to enjoy 'The Flintstones,' too.
- I think 'The Simpsons' is in the right time slot because it's not a show for kids. It's too vulgar. And 'Ren and Stimpy' is worse. We would never do anything like that.
- Greatest thing in our partnership is the sharing of responsibility; if one of us has to go away, we always know someone vitally concerned is on the spot.
- In 'Tom and Jerry,' there was hardly any dialogue at all. It was all action. It required a great many drawings to make.
- It takes four people to lay out the 'Flintstones.'
- We're delighted that Freddie Flintstone and his friends have made such a hit. The comedy is not the old cartoon slapstick. Most of it is situation stuff and dialogue.
- We moved amazingly fast because our product was acceptable to a broad market: tots, teenagers, adults. Even to some people who never before liked cartoons. When we started we knew Disney already had the kids. So we figured we should be broader.
- On the 'Tom and Jerry's,' Joe and I would sit across a desk from each other and develop the story. Joe would do the storyboard and I'd do the timing and the direction of the animation.
- You know that Yogi and Huckleberry didn't just belong to the kids. Grownups know all about our animal friends.
- I started out with three creative jobs - painter, janitor and gag writer.
- When we were at MGM, we never did much about merchandise tie-ups There were too many executives and lawyers to go through.
- We work in vertical and horizontal planes. We avoid depth characteristics as much as possible. This reduces the number of pictures in a five minute segment from 12,000 to 1,200. And the public likes the technique better.
- I enjoyed doing the 'Tom and Jerry' cartoons, and if we had never done anything else, I would have been perfectly satisfied.
- Cartoons ran into trouble when they became too much like real life images. Cartoons had become poor imitations of the real thing.
- We've never tried to educate children. We've never tried to preach to them, just entertain.
- Our stuff is made strictly for fun. We're not out to give a message.
- The early years of Hanna-Barbera were more fun than the later ones. I was working more in the creative areas of timing and direction then. But as the studio grew, I became more involved in administration and got away from the creative aspects.
- We all can't stay busy doing exactly what we want to do.
