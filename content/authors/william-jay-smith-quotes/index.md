- I have always used a great variety of verse forms, especially in my poetry for children. I believe that poetry begins in childhood and that a poet who can remember his own childhood exactly can, and should, communicate to children.
- I have felt at times with groups of children that I was really being what every poet would like to be - a bard in the old sense.
- For every artist, experience is never complete until it has been reproduced in creative work.
- As any parent, teacher, or librarian knows, there is no richer experience than to see children's faces light up at the suspense of a new tale or the surprise of a new poem. The uninhibited joy with which they listen is surely akin to that of adult audiences of old around campfire and hearth.
- It was the enchantment of spoken verse that led me to write for children.
- I believe that poetry should communicate.
- To Tennessee Williams we owe a special debt. In a tragic age, he has transformed loneliness by naming it for us, suffered sordidness with beauty, graced poor hurt lives with love and pity.
- A fresh and vigorous weed, always renewed and renewing, it will cut its wondrous way through rubbish and rubble.
- I have published so many books in so many years. I can't complain about any lack of attention. But I've never been placed as a Southern writer, which I really am. So I was happy finally to be published by someone in the South.
- To the poet, his travels, his adventures, his loves, his indignations are finally resolved in verse, and this, in the end becomes his permanent, indestructible life.
- I still use a typewriter from time to time, but because I can't type as well as I used to, I really don't use one very much.
- I always had good recognition from the Southern writers, but the publishers never took any notice of that.
