- Deficits do not in themselves produce inflation, nor does a balanced budget assure a stable price level.
- Firms would be given initial entitlements to gross markup on the basis of past performance. These entitlements would be transferable and a market in them would be developed.
- The insane pursuit of the holy grail of a balanced budget in the end is going to drive the economy into a depression.
- Nearly all educational expenditure should be considered a capital outlay, whether it provides a future return in the form of enhanced taxable income or in terms of an enhanced quality of life.
