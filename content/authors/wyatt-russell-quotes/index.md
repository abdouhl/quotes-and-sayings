- I played professional hockey in Europe. I played in the German third league and the Dutch elite league.
- My parents are actors and never brought work home. I didn't even know what they did until I was about 10 years old. We never talked about it.
- Anybody that lives in America and has parents with a moderate amount of wealth can be spoiled. I see it every day - kids who are just running their parents over to get what they want because kids are smart, and they know they can manipulate their parents.
- I had been pulling my groins in college a lot and missed my whole freshman year of college because of groin pulls. It was chronic, and I couldn't figure it out. I went to the doctor, and he told me I had hip dysplasia. So I knew my hockey days were sorta limited at that point.
- The first movie that ever scared me, I feel like it wasn't a scary movie. I feel like it was 'Dennis the Menace' or something.
- Having parents that have been through the wars of films and having a brother and sister who have done it at the highest level, you gain an appreciation. But we've always had closeness as a family. That's our anchor.
- When I was young, with my brothers, we'd make movies all the time, and that was never scripted.
- The Russell side of my family is a clan with some serious genetics.
- I've done two movies with Jim Mickle. He's somebody that I'd love to do another movie with.
- I was a hockey player. I played hockey forever. That was my life and my job until I got injured, so I get sports, and I get the sports atmosphere, the feeling around other athletes, but I never played football.
- My dad, in the best way possible - not in an intimidating way, but with the physically intimidating qualities that every father has - can truly be scary. The only time you saw that side of him, the raw side of him, would be in a moment when you truly were the one that screwed up.
- Recently, my dad has been teaching me a lot - like how to read a script. It used to just be about hockey or baseball or sports of whatever. We don't have glitzy or glamour-y Hollywood-type talk, like, 'Isn't that person great?' It's more about the process of how it works.
- I was in Toronto with my parents, and my dad took me to an outdoor hockey rink. I was 3 or 4, and I just remember everything about that day. For some reason, I thought, 'This is it. This is what I'm supposed to do.' And this is around the time that Gretzky came to L.A., so I immediately joined a hockey league.
- When I stopped playing hockey and started acting, the last person I was going to ask for help was my dad. He's the king of being like, 'I don't know. It's good work if you can get it. Good luck.'
- I would consider my dad a pretty patient guy, but there was no tolerance for spoiled behavior.
- In hockey, it was a freak show. I'm the son of actors and from California, and in Canada, hockey is a religion, so me coming in, it was like, 'Who the hell is this guy?' I just had to put my head down and work really hard, and it was difficult, but it made me who I am and gave me a backbone.
- Acting was what everybody thought I should do, and at 15, when you love something so much, it's like - 'That's not what I do. That's what they do.'
- 'Boy' is one of my top-five favorite movies of all time.
- The last thing I wanted to do was act, because it was the path of least resistance.
- I went on an audition. I walked in the room, and it was Leslie Mann with Judd Apatow. It was intimidating.
- No one wants to watch anybody play baseball in a movie. What is interesting is what baseball means or sports in general means to those people doing it.
- When you're an athlete, you've got the horse blinders on pretty thick. Your exploration of other things in life tends to be limited because you have to have such a focus on what you're doing. I wasn't a good enough player to stray from that focus and still keep my ability.
- I got hurt when I was 19. They thought I broke my neck. I couldn't move my hands or feet, and I had a very bad experience.
- Acting was something fun that my dad did, but baseball is what he really wanted to do.
- In hockey, there are no second chances, but the great thing about acting is that there actually are. If you do a scene and you think you can do better - take two!
