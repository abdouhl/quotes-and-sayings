- I've played with great players and worked with great managers; I've learned a lot from all of them.
- I've been lucky, but I have earned that luck.
- I would never have dreamed to have had such a nice career as this. I like football, and this is like a nice football journey.
- There are not many better clubs to play football for than Liverpool.
- I have played against, but not with, Zinedine Zidane and would liked to have played with him.
- I have been lucky enough to work with great coaches. My father was also a coach, and my position in central midfield requires tactical knowledge.
- Cristiano has unique qualities, brings danger in one-on-one situations, and has the ability to score and find something different.
- My game is not to have one great action. My game is to be consistent throughout: to bring the ball in the best and quickest possible way for the best players to make the last action.
- Of course Zidane has surprised me as a coach. I didn't know how he would do.
- Writing is not my thing; playing football is my thing.
- If I decide somewhere along the way to take my chances as a manager, my link, my commitment, my passion with Liverpool is there.
- At Liverpool, I used to read the match day programme, and you'd read an interview with a lad from the youth team. They'd ask age, heroes, strong points, etc. He'd reply, 'Shooting and tackling.' I can't get into my head that football development would educate tackling as a quality, something to learn, to teach, a characteristic of your play.
- So many times, football is really unfair.
- Guardiola has a lot of knowledge about the game and understands the psychology of the players. You can see all the things he is doing well.

- I came from my hometown team, Real Sociedad, to the best team in England, to the best team in Spain, to the best team in Germany.
- Anything can happen in football.
- My idea was to stay in Madrid. Then, when I heard of Munich's interest, I said, 'Xabi, think what you want and where you will be happy.'
- I don't think I will stop learning about football. There are certain parts we will never understand, like what happens in the brain of a player or makes a team fear.
- Bayern is a big club and a big brand, but on a daily basis, it's a family club. You get to know the physios, the kit man, the chefs. It's also a club that's very close to the supporters. That proximity to the fans makes it special. That was surprising. In Liverpool and Madrid, there's more distance.
- You need to have the same ideas to work as a team, to have a good team spirit. And you don't get there in a day or even a month. It takes some time to get there.
- I remember playing with my dad, and my kids will remember this as well.
- They value different things in every country. In England, it's very physical. You tackle, you shoot. I love watching it. In Spain, it's different. Pass the ball, move, find the space.
- At the end, when you play, you want to win.
- I stay in contact with friends I have in Liverpool. It's not a normal club; it's so special and very important to me.
- If you go out and play your own way, anything can happen. You might win.
- The midfielders are important: they have to offer themselves to receive the ball and make good use of it, take choices, try not to lose the ball and defend. But I don't feel like a leader at all.

- I wanted to end my career still at the highest level, and Bayern is the highest level.
- If you win the midfield, you probably win the game. But that doesn't mean the players in the midfield are the ones alone who determine that, because now we have strikers who drop into midfield and defenders who move up into the midfield. It is the area you must dominate.
- With Senna, I am not incompatible; I am not incompatible with anyone.

- I'm incredibly proud and happy to play for FC Bayern and to be a part of this family.
- I've still got Paul Scholes' shirt at home, which I swapped with him once. When I was at Liverpool, he was one of the players I liked most.
- Passion? Of course it's necessary, but it's more important to have footballing foundations, certainly, when developing players.
- Each time I watch a Liverpool game, I feel something special, especially whenever it's at Anfield, because it brings back great memories.
- The Bundesliga is much quicker; it's more physical than the Liga, which is more technical.
- While I was at Madrid, for me, Cristiano was the best.
- I have been lucky enough to be at great clubs, from my hometown club to Liverpool to Real Madrid to Bayern Munich.

- Anoeta is always a tough place to go: people get right behind their side.

- I have learned from all of my coaches, and I am sure I will learn a lot with Guardiola.
- Of course it's better to have good players to build a better team. But to build a team, you need to have time.
- The only thing I regret is not winning the Premier League with Liverpool. I'll never know how that feels and experience the reaction of the city, as I did after Istanbul. It hurts because I know the people want the league title more than anything.
- I have played at Liverpool, a special club, grown as a player and won titles.
- My family have absolutely no problem about me playing for Real Madrid. They have become Real Madrid fans.
- Everything can change in the Champions League.
- I prefer not to compare teams because it's not fair at all.
- When the results are good, everything seems prettier; when things go bad, it seems like all conflicts, personal disputes, and problems arise.
- If you have control of the midfield, you have control of the game, and you have more chances to win.
- Leaving Liverpool was the toughest decision I had to make in football because I was in an exemplary club, a proper football club, with a lovely and sharing stadium that meant a lot of things to me. The fans are the best in the world, no doubt about that, and I was comfortable there.
- It is a fact for any footballer - you can be really happy, but if the club don't want you, you have to accept it.
- People in Liverpool are very welcoming.
- It is difficult to copy Real Madrid, as not every team has those players who can run with such explosion, like Ronaldo.
- If I have to yell at Cristiano Ronaldo, I yell.
- I know what my strengths and weaknesses are on the pitch. My duty is to be risk averse.
- Sometimes that kind of last-ditch tackle can get the crowd excited, and you get a push from that. It's important to play with that psychological side of the game, but it depends on the quality of the player.
- Munich is a very good city to live in. The life quality is superb.
- To be fighting at European level, you need players who know how to play in the big games.
- I accept I am going to miss playing because it's such an important part in my life. It's going to be difficult to fill that gap. Life goes on.

- Real Madrid is a big club, and like at any other big club, too, there are always critics after defeats.
- Neuer is by far the best keeper I've played with and is also outstanding outfield.
- I don't want to just play well; I want the players around me to play better, and that's when I feel that I have done my job.
- I think Kimmich is a bit like Mascherano. They are similar type of players.
- I feel very comfortable with the system used by Mourinho. It's a very dynamic 4-2-3-1 that can easily change to 4-3-3 or 4-1-4-1 depending on the moment or the team's needs. He really knows what he wants.
- It's hard to imagine being an ex-player. It's not easy to find a new passion.
- I have been progressing throughout my career, which is a very good sign.
- I grew up a lot as a professional and as a person in Liverpool, and I have very strong links to the club and the city.
- Growing doesn't mean renouncing your history.
- I don't try to do things that might make me look stupid, because the risk is there.
- Madrid is a big city. It's very dynamic and cosmopolitan.
- In England, those qualities of playing it simple, being in the right position, reading the game, knowing the right moment to make things happen around you are not appreciated. Making a tackle, a run into the box - the spectacular things are more appreciated.
- Being a manager is so different to being a footballer. It's a very difficult job, but, of course, it's very exciting as well.
- I hardly ever get in the box.
- Cristiano's numbers are amazing, indisputable.
- I don't think tackling is a quality. It is a recurso, something you have to resort to, not a characteristic of your game.
- Ronaldo can create and score goals.
- I am still as slow as I was when I was 20.
- I used to enjoy watching Ronald Koeman, even though he didn't play in my position. I loved the way he hit the ball, the talent he had to position himself.
- That's one thing that I've always wanted: to make my own decisions and not to be pushed. That has happened in my career, and I wanted to leave football, not football to leave me. I wanted to enjoy it as much as I could and to leave it a little bit earlier than too late.
- I have improved with time by playing for elite teams in elite leagues and the Champions League and with the Spanish national team in World Cups and European Championships.
- How many times have you seen me run into the box with the ball, dribbling past players? It's uncommon because it's not my game; it's not my thing.
- There have been many games where Xavi and I have played together, and I think we work well.
- The grass, the sound of the ball, the jokes with my teammates - that's what I will miss most. That is what fulfills you most on a daily basis.
- I want to win the Champions League with Bayern.
- There were many good reasons to move to Bayern, and Pep Guardiola was definitely one of them.
- I feel good; my family and I feel comfortable in Munich.
- Everyone should know my quality and what I bring to the team.
- That is probably the biggest issue about the English game. You need to be a great player and great at striking the ball, of course, but it's also about your head and being able to understand the game, especially for a midfielder.
