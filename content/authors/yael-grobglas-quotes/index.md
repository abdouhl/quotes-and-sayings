- As an actor, the first thing you're taught is, 'Don't look into the camera; ignore it.'
- Back home, almost everything I did, I did in Hebrew. I went to drama school in Hebrew, my whole career was in Hebrew, and to switch languages was something that was fascinating and more complicated than I expected it to be, even though I've been speaking English since I could speak.
- I feel like if I consider myself comfortable in something, then that's not exactly where I want to be. And in 'Jane the Virgin' specifically, I feel like I don't have to choose... We get to do drama and comedy sometimes within the same thirty seconds.
- I'm usually cast for the more goofy and tomboyish characters.
- Israel has a fantastic film industry, and many times we are known for our political films or films that have to do with the army. I love the fact that we can show that there are films coming out of Israel that are just for fun.
- Honestly, I'd love to say I live this amazing Hollywood lifestyle, but actually, I'm at home with my same friends and cooking. I crochet, I do watercolor. I think what surprised me the most is that that isn't the lifestyle everyone necessarily lives.
