- On the sets, Ali Zafar was extremely entertaining... he would just start singing out of the blue. It was just great!
- I think Kareena Kapoor is gorgeous. She is effortless. I have never seen her go overboard with her make-up or the way she dresses. Even off-screen or when travelling, she looks gorgeous.
