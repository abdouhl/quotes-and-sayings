- Half of architecture students are women, and you see respected, established female architects all the time.
- I don't think I am that tough, actually. Well, tough in the sense that I don't take any rubbish, and that doesn't make me very popular, frankly. I mean, because some people say something to me, and I just tell them off. I mean, why should I put up with it?
- I have been interested in fashion since I was a kid. Then I lived in London, where it was more about costume and a personal statement of who you are than about fashion.
- The spirit of adventure to embrace the new and the incredible belief in the power of invention attracted me to the Russian avant-garde.
- Of course, my family helped me, my brothers helped me, but after I set up my own office I had to really help myself. Some people seem to think I had an oil well in my garden! It's a nice idea but not true.
- I'm a pushover. I make allowances for people if I like them.
- I am equally proud of all of my architectural projects. It's always rewarding to see an ambitious design become reality.
- When I taught, all my best students were women.
- You don't always have to show art in what's called a white box; you can have a kind of complexity within an exhibit which actually respects the art as well.

- The commission process in America and England is different. In America, they do it through an interview process, and it's really based on whether they like you or not. I mean, it's nothing to do with whether you do the best scheme or the worst scheme.
- Would they call me a diva if I were a guy?

- I am quite sensitive to politics, because you know, as an Arab, an Iraqi, all your life, you are very conscious of it.
- For many years, I hated nature. As a student, I refused to put a plant anywhere - a living plant, that is. Dead plants were OK.
- Women are always told, 'You're not going to make it, its too difficult, you can't do that, don't enter this competition, you'll never win it,' - they need confidence in themselves and people around them to help them to get on.
- I am sure that as a woman I can do a very good skyscraper.
- I miss aspects of being in the Arab world - the language - and there is a tranquility in these cities with great rivers. Whether it's Cairo or Baghdad, you sit there and you think, 'This river has flown here for thousands of years.' There are magical moments in these places.
- All the privileged can travel, see different worlds; not everyone can. I think it is important for people to have an interesting locale nearby.
- I don't think that architecture is only about shelter, is only about a very simple enclosure. It should be able to excite you, to calm you, to make you think.
- I used to not like being called a 'woman architect': I'm an architect, not just a woman architect. Guys used to tap me on the head and say, 'You are okay for a girl.' But I see the incredible amount of need from other women for reassurance that it could be done, so I don't mind that at all.
- If you think about making a city that is much more porous, many accessible spaces, that is a political position, because you don't fortify, you open it up so that many people can use it.

- Like men, women have to be diligent and work hard.
- I'm into fashion because it contains the mood of the day, of the moment - like music, literature, and art.
- Contrary to popular view, I've never been patronized in the Middle East. Men maybe treat women differently, but they do not treat them with disrespect. They don't hate women. It's a very different kind of mentality.
- I have always appreciated designers who dare to reinterpret fabrics and proportions, so I follow the Japanese and Belgian designers. The pieces are so animated. When they lie still, they are one thing, but once you stand them up or wear them, they become something else.
- Good education is so important. We do need to look at the way people are taught. It not just about qualifications to get a job. It's about being educated.
- I don't particularly like showing furniture on pedestals, but for whatever reasons you always have to in museums.
- I've always thought that design can have equal importance to the idea of internal architecture. Professionally, things can be very dogmatic - you do the architecture, someone else does the interiors, someone else does the furniture, the fabric, etc. But I think design is all-encompassing.

- Of course I believe imaginative architecture can make a difference to people's lives, but I wish it was possible to divert some of the effort we put into ambitious museums and galleries into the basic architectural building blocks of society.
- When you are overworked and exhausted, there is a sense of kind of delirium and that's why I think architects do all-nighters and they kind of do those deadlines. For four days I remember doing four nights in one row with no sleep. I mean nobody, unless you are crazy, would do that, but you are totally focused on the project.
- I think that the training of architects allows you to see what will happen ten years ahead of time, or twenty. It's not guessing, it's not intuitive, it's based on research - and we may be wrong.
- I loved London. In the 1970s... it was very exciting, really wild.
- People say I design architectural icons. If I design a building and it becomes an icon, that's ok.
- In Iraq, many of my female friends were architects and professionals with a lot of power during the 1980s while all the men were at war in Iran.
- Society has not been set up in a way that allows women to go back to work after taking time off. Many women now have to work as well as do everything at home and no one can do everything. Society needs to find a way of relieving women.
- It's very important for cities all around the world to reinvent themselves, and Glasgow is a good example of that. The Scots are very nice. I don't think they are burdened by their history.

- People in power, they're so used to people kind of playing up to them.

- Architecture is unnecessarily difficult. It's very tough.
- I really believe in the idea of the future.
- I always thought I was powerful, since I was a kid.
- I love driving around east London - it's always full of surprises. Actually, I don't drive myself - I like to be driven.
- I don't think that everybody in the planet should have a child. I've never had the desire I should have a kid.
- I think it's good if areas get upgraded and gentrified, as long as the people who always lived there can stay. But they get pushed out to some place.

- My generation were all careerists.
- I will never give myself the luxury of thinking, 'I've made it.'
