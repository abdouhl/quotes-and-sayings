- I think what happens with a lot of writing and art is that specificity ends up being relatable while universality becomes vague.
- When the Berlin Wall came down, my dad left to visit the U.S. He met my mom at this summer camp where they were both working, so I grew up between Washington Heights and Germany speaking two languages.
- I'm pretty picky about my hair, so I end up always styling it myself.
- I used to work at Cafe Mogador in the East Village. I love Mogador, but I feel like working almost anywhere will kind of ruin it for you. There was a lot of panicking while being a waitress there. I don't like to think about that. But I love the food.
- I've begun feeling that my responsibility is to the Earth. Our generation's war is climate change, so I've really been modifying how I eat and what I eat.
- What I crave, and what I want to see on television, is when you see a minority character, not to have it being about them being black or Asian or Latino. If you watch 'Friends,' for example, it's not about a group of people being white. It's about a group of people being friends, you know? You should just let the characters exist.
- I love babies. I also have this very deep desire to become a mother. I always thought that motherhood was my highest calling.
- I identify with my womanhood before anything else because that's what I deal with when I am alone.
- I worry about not being able to be myself day to day. But I know people way more famous than me who have been able to do that.
- It is so frustrating to feel in danger. People have followed me around at 2 in the morning and have literally said, 'Don't make me follow you. You're not responding to me.' It's incredibly degrading.
- At home in my room, I'm funny, but if I'm commissioned to be that, I don't feel very funny.
- I like representing different kinds of black people - showing they exist.
- I feel like, every six months, I learn my hair or my skin anew and find a new thing that I like to do, and then I abandon it and move on.
- Growing up, my aunts would always put in hair ties and bows and all kinds of stuff, and I always hated it.
- Walking in the street, particularly in a city like New York, every single day, I am reminded of how objectified women can be. Being catcalled every day, multiple times a day, all the time... it just constantly happens.
- My father is German; my mother is African-American. Growing up, I visited my grandparents in Berlin a lot. I would not see any other person of color for three weeks. People would stare. They would say things like, 'Oh, you look like chocolate - I want to eat you up!'
- For me, a big thing growing up was naturalness - both in being and appearance. My mom never let me relax my natural hair. For so long, I thought I was ugly, and I still sometimes struggle with that. But now I've come to feel like this is me.
- Some people feel like women should dress in a way that doesn't promote attention-seeking. But this is just my body. My body in itself isn't only sexual.
- I always thought my alternative life, if I wasn't acting, would be to become a midwife. I love women. I want to help them exist.
- Despite my career, so much of my life has been dictated by what I'm afraid of: fear that I am not talented. Fear that people will finally realize that I am a boring individual who doesn't have many ambitions beyond starting a family 'at a good time' in life.
- I've had acting teachers say, 'If you want to do anything else but act, that means you're not an actor,' which I think is stupid!
- Bad bread is the one thing I refuse. I need good bread.
- I feel like I pull inspiration, in general, from how I feel on a day.
- Growing up I definitely, definitely had a bunch of things of, 'Um, am I black enough?' - and I guess specifically, 'Am I German enough?' Why are we measuring blackness?
- I wish I was a morning person.
- The truth is all kinds of people exist everywhere. So let's tell their stories, too.
- I was an only child until I was 15, so I was able to reap the benefit of that.
- I remind myself that, though there was a time anxiety might have stopped me, today is not that day. And so, by checking in with myself, minute by minute, I push myself through.
- I don't know how people say exercising is addictive.
- I used to cry on planes. I don't anymore. It probably took almost a hundred agonizing flights to get there. Now, when I take off, a smile quivers on the corner of my lips.
- I actually didn't think I was going to do TV because I don't really watch TV. I'm a little bit pretentious, and I do these little indie movies, so I envisioned that more as the path for myself.
- For me, fear manifests itself in snoozing and inactivity. I just become so sleepy, any time of day, when something needs to be done. I sometimes go days without responding to texts or reading books or being able to process much of anything beyond the sun slowly creeping through my living room windows.
- The version of me on the Internet, it's not me. It's one portion.
- In the United States, if you're African-American, it can be assumed that your family has been here for generations. In Europe, colonialism is much more alive, and it's assumed you're from Nigeria or Senegal.
- Agriculture is one of the biggest causes of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Cars? Planes? Trains? Nope. Cow farts.
- One day, I'd like to tackle a biopic. I grew up very influenced by Josephine Baker, Billie Holiday, and Nina Simone.
- It's fascinating working with young children. You have to improvise around them, and they're moving around and doing stuff, and you have to be real with them.
- I do wonder if it's my responsibility to spread a message of environmental awareness or political awareness or just, like, don't be racist or whatever, but I don't want to be the person who's like, 'Everyone be vegan forever!'
