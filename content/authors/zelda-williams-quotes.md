- When I embarked on creating 'Shrimp' a couple of years ago, I never could've imagined where this journey would take me or the wonderful people I'd come to know along the way.
- Dad was, is, and always will be one of the kindest, most generous, gentlest souls I've ever known, and while there are few things I know for certain right now, one of them is that not just my world but the entire world is forever a little darker, less colorful, and less full of laughter in his absence.
- I think a lot of people are worried about being alone. I completely understand that. I really do. Being alone is terrifying, especially when you've lost people.
- More than anything, I wanted to be Aragorn in 'Lord of the Rings,' and I wanted to be Lirael in the 'Sabriel' trilogy. The only way I was ever going to get to do that was act, so I tried.
- Cartoons make kids happy, and that's a great feeling.
- Probably the most important thing in terms of just trying to navigate and moving forward into adulthood is staying busy.
- Being bisexual doesn't mean I'm suddenly willy-nilly running around.
- For a man so incredibly hairy and square, watching my dad get on a bike was like watching a penguin spread its wings and take flight. He'd take off at inhuman speed, a smile on his face, and never look back.
- My family has always been private about our time spent together.
- For me, there's a lot of erasure of bisexuality. I think a lot of people - especially in women - they tend to have really bad responses to it.
- I'm not a girly girl. I never have been.
- I watch every horror film that comes out in theatres. I watch every horror film that's on Netflix.
- I'm not one of these new supermodel girls on Instagram in bikinis. I'm different, but that's okay.
- If you have things that make you sad, express them to other people.
- For those suffering from depression, I know how dark and endless that tunnel can feel. But if happiness seems impossible to find, please hold on to the possibility of hope, faint though it may be.
- I've always enjoyed gaming, but even as I got older, and I started to get deeper into writing and all this stuff that is my grown-up job, I couldn't play as much as I used to.
- My favorite photos of family are framed in my house, not posted on social media, and they'll remain there.
- I want people to be more accepting.
- Social media is really not for conversations. There are people that you can meet and talk to on it, but it was not created for that. People wanted things that were soap boxes, where they could say what they wanted, and they don't have to respond to anyone else.
- I was always comfortable with my sexuality.
- Hummingbirds are fun and flighty and strange. It's hard to keep them in one place, and Dad was a bit like that.
- Every teenager, I think, thinks it's the end of the world whenever anything happens, and it's not. You'll get through it. Life will be much more interesting and will certainly be broader when you're older.
- I have two dogs, and I write at home.
- I'm really casual.
- To say the 'Save My Soul' video means a lot to me would be an understatement of stupendous proportions.
- I can imagine Dad joking about how hard it'd be to get an actor to give back when it's hard enough to ask them to give a good performance.
- I like hummingbirds.
- I had a shaved head for six years.
- I didn't really grow up in the spotlight.
- Whether by my own volition or otherwise, I was given a year-and-a-half break after Dad passed. It was kind of like an elephant in the room, and everyone was giving me space, whether I wanted it or not.
- Avoiding fear, sadness, or anger is not the same thing as being happy.
- For me it's easy to continue remembering someone that is impossible to forget.
- I've been working really hard, and it's been nice because you get to not sit with yourself for too long.
- Truthfully, you're not your audience, so all that self-consciousness and all that - it gets in the way of you actually just being the best thing in whatever thing that you're doing.
- I think the concept of ego has kind of taken over for a lot of people in our industry.
