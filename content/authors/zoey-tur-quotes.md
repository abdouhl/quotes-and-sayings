- I know the way this city works. We have one of the most corrupt cities in the country. The reason it's so corrupt is because everybody thinks it's honest, and it's not. You know the truth when you go to Chicago. The difference here in Los Angeles is you believe it's honest - and that's dangerous.
- Transgender people really are misunderstood.
- I was raised in an environment where chaos was the norm, so I was at my best in chaos.

- Trying to erase 53 years of being a macho aggressive guy to trying to be a woman, and this is greatest challenge of my life.

- We filed suit against YouTube before the Google purchase. At the time I went after YouTube, I thought it was a small company ripping off our copyrights.

- I'm so much more at ease now than when I was flying as Bob. Then, I was OCD about everything, always checking and looking for things. But flying as a female is effortless. I'm still checking traffic, instruments, and the radios, but it's easier to multitask, and flying is fun.

- When you're living a lie, the scariest thing is to be alone with your thoughts.
- If someone asks about sexual reassignment surgery, you are supposed to say, 'Why are we talking about that?' But I am a post-op transsexual. And I am a reporter. If you can explain and talk about it, you demystify it. And if you demystify it, it's not an issue.
- I always felt like a fraud.
- True transgenders do hypermasculine things.
- While television can help normalize the lives of marginalized people, it also can exploit their hardships and reinforce stereotypes, reducing their lives to mere entertainment.

- One thing I quickly discovered as a female pilot - ditch the heels!
- There's diversity in nature, so why not the media?

- Everything about the Kardashian family's public image centers around shock and dysfunction - the very image the trans people are trying to shed.
- That's violence, terrible violence, to tell a woman to sit down and shut up.
- If what the transgender movement seeks is acceptance, association with the Kardashian circus is the last thing it needs.

- I was told I'd never work again, but once you come out, it's like someone turns on the lights, and your life will be different.
